audio_0_172945.wav	So, likewise this is another type of techniques that is machine learning	train
audio_0_15507.wav	So, if this circuit is given right you have to find out the currents of these whatever is given right	train
audio_0_19541.wav	Today we are going to learn a technique known as standard costing or variance analysis that is primarily useful for cost control purposes	train
audio_0_3604.wav	So, just I have written for this thing the armature of DC machines is build up of thin lamination of low loss silicon steel	train
audio_0_154718.wav	Now, in our low pass prototype, we had seen that we have capacitances in shunt and inductances in series	train
audio_0_166655.wav	If you do that then this declaration of i is local to this for loop that is once you come out of the for loop you are in the subsequent cout statement or later on i will not be considered to have been declared	train
audio_0_166224.wav	But, I am saying that the reference x is constant; which means that no change of x is possible	train
audio_0_118779.wav	And this time, we will do the simulation in frequency domain	train
audio_0_115724.wav	So, you can see that there are N elements	train
audio_0_121041.wav	So, the external marketing is making the promise are calibrating the customer expectation and on the left hand side it is enabling the promise or all the back stage activities, that creates the capability and competence for the organization to meet or go beyond the promise in the customers mind	train
audio_0_24264.wav	Yes, green is the stuff I want and red is the stuff I don’t want	train
audio_0_19883.wav	Now this is the total sale revenue projected which will be given in the sales budget	train
audio_0_130778.wav	list type of operation where do you have a double linked list and during the malloc or during the free when you want to remove a linked list during coalescing or during malloc when you actually want to allocate this chunk of memory to a particular malloc request you will have to adjust the pointers present in this job, so essentially the forward pointer and the backward pointer should be appropriately corrected	train
audio_0_114970.wav	So, maximum output power of two port oscillator is given by this particular expression	train
audio_0_169334.wav	This is possible because this is possible so Up cast	train
audio_0_124008.wav	Now, if you see on the desk, I have this wafer box; wafer holder in which I have this oxidized silicon and I am going to show it to you	train
audio_0_162859.wav	All that Poornima now has to do is to take the applications that Savitha had developed and Niloy had developed and put them into two different namespaces	train
audio_0_133795.wav	So, these were some of the examples of gadgets that we have created, in reality there are a lot of tools available on the internet which you could use to build ROP gadgets	train
audio_0_13950.wav	So, v 0 is equal to 40 volt , now i 1 is equal to minus 6 ampere this means that 6 ampere current is flowing into the 10 volt 10 volt volt the source	train
audio_0_17545.wav	As per the current calculation, it is 2 hours per unit at 3 rupees	train
audio_0_148926.wav	we have the concept of a genius in our tradition, at some point of time when people were exploring the concept of visual arts ah, and especially ah literary arts, the concept of a genius and ah the quality of a genius, which was known as prathiva, was explored in the ancient sanskrit tradition	train
audio_0_4910.wav	So line voltage is equal to V L and we know V L is equal to root 3 in to phase voltage right magnitude	train
audio_0_139047.wav	so pg two is point five	train
audio_0_141785.wav	y by two, two z y by two compute, it will be this: one right minus point zero, one, two, three plus j point zero, zero, two, six, four	train
audio_0_121837.wav	So, these things you have to determine, so fundamental; that is why say that there is a set of internal analysis, organizations resources, limitations, goals, values and you have to external analysis not only the competitor, but also the structure of the market the rules and regulations, non price barriers if any and so on	train
audio_0_107565.wav	How do these differ as far as the structural mechanics of the wall that you are constructing is concerned	train
audio_0_140933.wav	d is equal to i x sin delta r, and your e a is equal to i	train
audio_0_108972.wav	Then the tensile stress in the bar will limit the level of compression in the bar itself, sorry, in the masonry itself	train
audio_0_4407.wav	So, now, if you if you now this is this is A, this is B this is that conductor length is L and this actually flux density this is B flux density	train
audio_0_167830.wav	So, there is several different kinds of mechanism was plotted then through the standard libraries and variety of them a mixture of that, but none of them is gives you a clean solution, and these are some of the short comings of error handling in C	train
audio_0_114658.wav	So, from here then half power goes here half power goes here and half power goes over here half power goes over here and in fact if you just do little bit of a simplification I will just give you a little hint here	train
audio_0_108709.wav	Since this is prescriptive in nature, the recommendations are prescriptive in nature, you have specific prescriptions for the different tie elements and protocols that must be followed when these are being constructed	train
audio_0_3817.wav	So, accordingly you have to your; what you call you have to solve; that means, when you are when you are making in this branch	train
audio_0_128523.wav	Iis it amplitude or time	train
audio_0_11800.wav	So that means, at this position that EMF induced at this position will be 0, it is that is whatever in the diagram it is shown	train
audio_0_23598.wav	In that after you done with solve, you always come back and check here and check if the conflict is addressed or not and that ends the analyse stage for us	train
audio_0_140355.wav	you take the derivative of this equation with respect to i th one, i th pgi when i is equal to two to m	train
audio_0_126896.wav	Now, what I am talking about frequency changes only in this value right	train
audio_0_114004.wav	So, this is gamma out looking from the output side of the device gamma l is looking at the input side from the load matching networks	train
audio_0_123890.wav	Transient response is nothing, but this gives you an idea of how fast the Op amp will response to the pulse input	train
audio_0_2065.wav	Also it could be provided as a set of 3d scene points or point cloud	train
audio_0_103628.wav	For other biopolymer networks you might have this G prime will still scale as C to the power x where x can have any value between 2 and 3 ok	train
audio_0_122346.wav	And if your perception after the service is lower than your expectation, then you are not satisfied, so the service quality customer satisfaction depend on this P minus E perception	train
audio_0_163829.wav	So, these are you will have to give the parameter type t there are certain basic operations and operations that T will have to satisfy	train
audio_0_168743.wav	But yes, in terms of read write this is similar, but that is a major difference because if I put it in public then the object will never get to known, when it is being this particular data member is being read or when it is being read	train
audio_0_155152.wav	Then coming back to this circuit that we discussed a few minutes ago, if we have to use another resonator, we essentially need a circuit, a hunter resonator in series	train
audio_0_151100.wav	So we will go for some examples	train
audio_0_1574.wav	Then you can prune subtree is by comparing the minimum distance with the corner nodes of the hyper volume	train
audio_0_116431.wav	So, where is this effective length coming into picture	train
audio_0_156365.wav	For the Class B as I said it conducts for exactly 180 degree	train
audio_0_108306.wav	And so this causes an additional bending moment and it is essential to consider this additional bending moment	train
audio_0_154888.wav	Now I will just give the definition of this PK, Delta K and delta and we will take an example to understand what these individual terms mean	train
audio_0_160453.wav	there will be n square dual constraint	train
audio_0_2024.wav	Say you are assuming the corresponding points between two images there exist in homography and you know that a plane planner is a planner scene induces the homography	train
audio_0_128945.wav	First thing is, that whether the resistor we are using is of the value that we want	train
audio_0_153569.wav	So, the curve lies on the surface that means, these point xt, yt, zt for any t as long as we are on the surface this curve lies on the surface, this will satisfy the given equation	train
audio_0_20176.wav	We saw this kind of flume formation, huge amount of energy was released by this nuclear bomb which was I think the name was little boy and that you probably have a seen this images also; this Enola gay is the name of the aircraft which carried that little boy and drop that on Hiroshima, this was a picture with their with their crew members and Bockscar was the aircraft which carried the next one that is a plutonium bomb towards Nagasaki on 9th of august	train
audio_0_141460.wav	so at two pm again it is going to two point five to six pm means up to this two point five megawatt	train
audio_0_117712.wav	A low power jammer will have a small range; a high power jammer will have a larger range	train
audio_0_148896.wav	and at ah in the nineteen sixties and seventies, again, the lot of very interesting tests developed and these tests again give us insight as to what is exactly that people tried to explore and analysed under the construct of creativity	train
audio_0_133337.wav	So, this public model PUF works in a very similar way, so except for the fact that the model for the PUF which is developed using the various gate delays and stored in the database present in the server does not have to be secret	train
audio_0_109047.wav	The overturning as a failure mechanism is a special case of the in plane flexural mechanism itself	train
audio_0_172945.wav	So, likewise this is another type of techniques that is machine learning	train

audio_0_109047.wav	The overturning as a failure mechanism is a special case of the in plane flexural mechanism itself	train
audio_0_114589.wav	Now, we need to find other 4 components also, so let us see how we can do that	train
audio_0_113214.wav	We want the impedance to be here to be 50 Ohm	train
audio_0_115699.wav	So, 4 uniform we get sidelobe level of minus 13	train
audio_0_158900.wav	we maintain complimentary slackness by making sure that wherever there is an allocation, u i plus v	train
audio_0_18496.wav	But what you are earning from an extra unit is your sale price and what you are paying is variable cost	train
audio_0_109508.wav	m bar that is going to be provided at alternate courses	train
audio_0_164914.wav	You cannot make an assignment, you cannot use	train
audio_0_166099.wav	So, this clearly show that between the two parameters b and c, c is following the original call by value rule by which is just the value of a which is copied to c	train
audio_0_3778.wav	So, upon making all these thing, these one, you will get finally, it is coming R 1 plus R 2 i 1 minus R 2 i 2 is equal to v 1	train
audio_0_106272.wav	So let's say if there is a situation of FTN being equal to FTP meaning there is no reserve strength available in the wall per se	train
audio_0_22725.wav	So probably again the administrative team will come into place and select the best set of questions that are tied to that particular master note	train
audio_0_165353.wav	You cannot hold that address	train
audio_0_117561.wav	These are not used conventionally because of the centre tapped transformer it becomes costly and the size of this amplifier is relatively more	train
audio_0_143406.wav	uh, so from your what you call from the symmetry, you can make all this, your what you call all, all, all the calculations, right	train
audio_0_13922.wav	So, next one ah now, next one you see now this is series parallel circuit, this circuit is a circuit is given , right	train
audio_0_163226.wav	So, now naturally you can use default parameters with function overloading	train
audio_0_150889.wav	And now the function is t f t instead of f t	train
audio_0_165342.wav	You do not have to bother about that and certainly it makes it faster in that sense because those checks are not required	train
audio_0_101642.wav	But these are all internal controls or internal molecules which will alter cytoskeletal organization, but in the context of stem cell differentiation has said that cell shape is one of the important regulators	train
audio_0_11852.wav	And A is equal to I told you the l b, the area of the loop in your what you call in square metre square metre or so, in this in this mathematical expression that a is will be in the metre square metre, metre square, right	train
audio_0_112888.wav	So, that is why we are starting with the G t ok	train
audio_0_133321.wav	Further, we assume that every day there should be challenged and response sent from the server to this edge device so as to authenticate the edge device, this would mean that the CRP database should have over thousand different challenges and response corresponding to this single edge device	train
audio_0_105447.wav	Now that's a catch because unit is the brittle material of the two and could be weak in tension	train
audio_0_17823.wav	So, pessimistic is 10, optimistic is 15	train
audio_0_162570.wav	If I have a set of classes and we want to know how these classes or objects of these classes will get constructed	train
audio_0_131006.wav	So, this invocation to memcpy essentially creates the response from the server back to the client	train
audio_0_11450.wav	And this I p phase current also line current, we have also computed 6	train
audio_0_1990.wav	So the question is that what should be the form of a model when, as I mentioned that a scenario when you are not sure about the precise structure of the model as we did in the previous cases of determining of homography matrix, fundamental matrix or projective matrix, the structures were very precisely defined	train
audio_0_129827.wav	So, how we can we coat the photoresistor	train
audio_0_1181.wav	Suppose this homograph is H1 and again apply homography from point from this view to this view and then all the points are registered on the same coordinate system and you can get the larger image	train
audio_0_165192.wav	Here, we invoke this function; here we again invoke this function	train
audio_0_26127.wav	So if you look at this, what this represents is something very important, that is, a circular shift of channel filter, or basically your channel taps, or basically channel filter over the samples, over the samples X zero, X one, X two, X three, and therefore the important point that it is a circular convolution	train
audio_0_115250.wav	So, let us start with S 1 1 S 1 1 is less than minus 47 db	train
audio_0_15973.wav	So, i x actually is equal to your V by 50 right	train
audio_0_116927.wav	So, there will be no power which is going to port 2	train
audio_0_100012.wav	Then what is their importance and what is their likelihood	train
audio_0_124258.wav	So, that was the experiment that I did and this is from my own work which I am showing it to you right now and then we will see that how we can use this micro cantilever for several applications including understanding the stiffness of the tissue, including understanding stiffness; STIFFNESS	train
audio_0_2829.wav	So, it is a radius, so all these write up is there, so just read carefully	train
audio_0_16967.wav	Just 1 minute	train
audio_0_126563.wav	Now, once you have this, if I give you another example	train
audio_0_157457.wav	It will be in terms of at least seconds	train
audio_0_164870.wav	So, by using C we are able to get to a solution we can survive, but we need to have better solutions for this problem, which is what we will discuss in the next module	train
audio_0_118710.wav	It will show you the results corresponding various parameters, which you have chosen	train
audio_0_125122.wav	This one is DC power supply, this is another DC power supply	train
audio_0_12439.wav	Therefore, your V l is equal to your 4 and current flowing through this is 1 ampere	train
audio_0_130662.wav	So, location 2000, 2001 and 2002 so, they are holding the instruction	train
audio_0_114299.wav	So, for this electron, the velocity of this electron will be reduced to the minimum	train
audio_0_158637.wav	now is there a way not to evaluate the second solution	train
audio_0_24301.wav	Obviously the ground is not moving, it’s at 0 speed so that’s going to lead to a lot of friction and hence leads to a lot of smoke and not only smoke, the smoke is because of all the tyre wear, okay	train
audio_0_114573.wav	So, here this part is only single quarter wave we will take example of 2 quarter wave also and we have seen that the single quarter wave provides impedance matching only at a single frequency, so we will see these results one by one	train
audio_0_104358.wav	What do focal adhesions do	train
audio_0_159635.wav	they are worth something	train
audio_0_138512.wav	similarly, if you, if you, sorry, first one is this is your d s b, so d b v	train
audio_0_124928.wav	So, what is the given	train
audio_0_113993.wav	So, hence we have given the term over here which is a generator tuning network this part is similar to that of amplifier design	train
audio_0_27780.wav	Basically, Sequential Estimation is about how to continuously keep estimating	train
audio_0_150558.wav	So, En t was f t minus Pn t and when we take the nth order derivative so nth order derivative will go to f and this is a n degree polynomial, n plus 1th degree, n plus 1th at derivative will be 0 of this polynomial so what we have that En the n plus 1th derivative will be simply the n plus 1th derivative of f because this is equal to 0	train
audio_0_123049.wav	There is a roll off for your band reject filter	train
audio_0_165650.wav	So, what it does is, it simply makes a bit copy which means it takes the complete bit pattern of the object to copy from and makes another bit pattern exactly seem as the object	train
audio_0_135314.wav	that's why i am telling now: when p i less than p e negative, so even p, i less than negative, my rotor will decelerate	train
audio_0_124034.wav	There are different orientation of silicon wafer or crystals	train
audio_0_159946.wav	if it is not already ticked, repeat this procedure	train
audio_0_127914.wav	So, one time teacher will show you, how to mix these things together and make a delicious cup of tea	train
audio_0_113754.wav	As frequency increases, now this dipole will be resonant, then this dipole will be resonant, then this dipole will be a resonant, so that means, what is happening, as frequency is increasing, the active region of the dipole antenna is basically shifting towards the smaller dipole	train
audio_0_137490.wav	so using twenty six and twenty seven means you put this gamma value here, here, you put the gamma value here, if you, if you do so then it will that twenty six and twenty seven it will become v	train

audio_0_152749.wav	So, here we are talking if we take on y z plane, if we take the projection on the y z plane, that means the P will become i	train
audio_0_134596.wav	So for example over here we had one specific row which has been continuously accessed and it could influence the charge stored in the adjacent rows, the reason for this is that continuously toggling the row voltage slightly opens the adjacent rows, thus forcing the adjacent rows to leak much more quickly	train
audio_0_156873.wav	Whenever D1 and D4 are conducting, we had already said from A it will flow to D1	train

audio_0_14294.wav	So that means, L into di by dt plus i R is equal to 0; that means, di by dt plus R upon L i is equal to 0 so or di upon i is equal to minus R upon L dt right, so integrate on both side	train
audio_0_142169.wav	so substitute everything here	train
audio_0_133126.wav	So let us see over here so each of this corresponds to a one character or so it is 4 characters that are printed by this, so one for each of these bytes then there is a space over here so five and another space over here six plus 54 so it is a total of sixty characters that gets printed	train
audio_0_169488.wav	But, it is also possible that it may not return any result	train
audio_0_158402.wav	i should not multiply with the negative number	train

audio_0_164014.wav	So, if you just recap those then there are four things, we can do we can call by reference in which case the actual formal parameter actually takes the reference to an actual parameter, that is both the formal and the actual parameter share the same memory location, share the same object	train
audio_0_167279.wav	Now given that address, I can actually find out what value exists at that pointed location by using the star or content of operator	train
audio_0_166318.wav	But consider the next one when the print is invoked for obj 2	train

audio_0_139982.wav	so assumptions are that for all network branches, ratio x by r is same	train
audio_0_118785.wav	4 gigahertz, so that the center frequency will be around 0	train
audio_0_139204.wav	so for that way the slope will be different if it moves from this point to this point it comes	train
audio_0_134242.wav	Now typically what is expected is that whenever there is EENTER instruction the only way to exit from the enclave is by this Enclave instruction	train
audio_0_171456.wav	less number of compound need to be is screened We can you can narrow down the compounds to a less number of compounds, so it can be virtually screen	train
audio_0_105020.wav	So, what does an alternate mode of operation; which is called the tapping mode	train
audio_0_128213.wav	But in case of integrated circuit technology it can be resistive material, it can be a dielectric material, it can be a conductive material etc	train
audio_0_103318.wav	So, that of course, brings to our first idea is, so, you know what is the solid, and what is the liquid	train
audio_0_111747.wav	In this particular you can see that, the back radiation will be very very small	train
audio_0_120500.wav	In that from there we must go to this value creation process, where again emphasis has to be on offering better and better values to your customer	train
audio_0_144976.wav	negative thing is essentially something which closes our mind	train
audio_0_125645.wav	Now, if I apply positive with respect to the substrate	train
audio_0_112111.wav	Now this is known as a analysis equation where W is given d is given	train
audio_0_167039.wav	As we have seen there it does not matter in terms of what actually are their signature what matters is they have the same name, and if they have the same name then the derived class cannot use them without any using qualification	train
audio_0_156924.wav	So I would be able to control how much voltage output I am getting	train
audio_0_109351.wav	However, I re read that this was a transitory phase	train
audio_0_168956.wav	What I have added for illustration, I have added a new member function method set which takes two double values and sets two values into the two data members of the class which can be invoked at point of time to set a complex value to my class, but what is missing now, you know is that there is no constructor and there is no destructor provided	train
audio_0_15255.wav	44 phi m f into N 1 therefore, phi m is equal to you just put E 1 value and all these values	train
audio_0_172501.wav	So, we have several ligands you can obtain all these ligands from zinc database, and your screen all these ligands with the target that is abs Abl kinase protein, then I am find the best ligand based on the interactions right	train
audio_0_170743.wav	Later on with the structures coming up then they tried to collect the more structural again and again right and they formed the consortium, they form this Research Collaboratory in Structural Bioinformatics, they found this the Protein Data Bank	train
audio_0_134657.wav	So let us say that we actually change this value to 3, we can do so by specifying sudo because changing the file requires sudo, sudo sh minus c echo 3 and this you redirect the output into slash proc sys kernel slash randomize VA underscore space, so we need the password which is which are 1, 2, 3	train
audio_0_133184.wav	Now as we know the typical memory management unit also has a TLB present in it	train
audio_0_17258.wav	They will have to worry because sales are dropping, but it can go up to 65% before which they will not go in losses	train
audio_0_3278.wav	Therefore, therefore, your this torque is equal to that this one is equal to say 1 minus S is equal to this one right; that means, 1 minus S your omega S T is equal to 1 minus S your P G	train
audio_0_13279.wav	Now, let me clear it; that means, my A B that is the vertical projection of this is equal to I m sin theta	train

audio_0_108662.wav	What you are saying is the wall construction is happening in say two or three lifts, in series of lifts and typically you might have a return wall and the return wall provides out of plain resistance as the construction is underway	train
audio_0_111296.wav	This is typically implemented using a variable attenuator technique, which we have discussed in the course	train
audio_0_168316.wav	And the same holds for post operator as well I have given some different functionality that your data is divided by three	train
audio_0_28129.wav	And now what we said is basically in the, that was the Lth FFT channel or the across the Lth sub channel, we have, um, well, we have Y L equals H L, X L plus V L	train
audio_0_172915.wav	Composition of A minus composition of X right	train
audio_0_22443.wav	This is one concept looks like or you can even…so there are two ways you can go	train

audio_0_357.wav	That means we need to find out the homography between the corresponding points between a point and the corresponding point of the scene point which is lying at plane at infinity	train
audio_0_172140.wav	For example if the two protein sequences which are similar to each other, you can take any specific cutoff for example, 70 percent or 80 percent	train
audio_0_162002.wav	so objective function is equal to ten	train
audio_0_114183.wav	So, this will provide feedback from output to input; and because of this feedback the gain of this triode decreases	train
audio_0_133186.wav	So, the TLB would be fully associative cache and it is expected that due the locality of the execution and memory accesses you are quite lucky to find the mapping of virtual to physical address present in the TLB and a lot of overheads will be reduced	train
audio_0_111074.wav	Then, we will talk about radiation pattern of a antenna, we will talk about safety norms in India and in other countries , we have done radiation measurements at more than thousand places then we will tell you what to we have found	train

audio_0_124140.wav	So, that means that it is very easy to identify the type of the wafer and the orientation; crystal orientation of the wafer depending on where the primary flat is and where the secondary flat is with respect to primary flat or whether secondary flat is there or not	train
audio_0_153098.wav	So, we have the cos t and then cos 0, 1 will be also coming there	train
audio_0_168890.wav	So, again we go back to the stack example	train
audio_0_143743.wav	so therefore, even if the this psychological factors are strong, like the core qualities of the individual, are there for resilience, then in that case the brain wearing can be changed accordingly so that you can be more resilient too	train
audio_0_153971.wav	So, again here we need a YC I beg your pardon, here we go from 1 YC susceptance to 0 susceptance, so we need around 1 ohms of capacitance of susceptance to be present in shunt	train
audio_0_125071.wav	See peak to peak is 10, but the voltage that you can see at the output is nothing but 5 volts, alright	train
audio_0_170275.wav	So, that is a typical style that we will often try to follow that, whenever we want to set some member, data member or may be at times get some data member even from within the member function of the class, we may want conceive whether we would directly set that or we will use some private member functions to set them	train
audio_0_2650.wav	So, cumulative distribution function is nothing, but integral of 0 to x naught, for x less than or equal to x naught, so, 1 minus e power x naught by mu	train

audio_0_115831.wav	So	train
audio_0_14134.wav	That means my I SC is equal to your I SC is equal to 1 plus 2 that is 3 ampere, what was I telling that 2 plus 1 initially 3 both in upward	train
audio_0_114021.wav	However, as you might recall Smith chart always represents gamma less than 1	train
audio_0_106315.wav	However in these two they are the numbers might work out to be slightly different but the intention is that on one hand the design forces are estimated based on the correct use of the R factor based on the type of building that you're looking at	train
audio_0_163953.wav	So, in this slide we show two more classes, one is a name class designed to keep or maintain names of a person	train
audio_0_160839.wav	we first you draw this line and then you draw this line, and then you say x one, x two, x, three, x four or the four variables	train
audio_0_161107.wav	this table tells us that the numbers are intact	train
audio_0_162681.wav	Then certainly the construction of the base object completes	train
audio_0_116622.wav	So, what we need to do it is	train
audio_0_131777.wav	Next, what we do is load the contents of this EDX register into this particular register	train
audio_0_143245.wav	you will make all this mathematical expression: long line, medium line and short line, medium line and long line	train
audio_0_157815.wav	So if I choose 5 volts I will basically get a firing angle of 90 degrees	train
audio_0_16811.wav	So, what we have learnt that for purely resistive circuit power absorbed is, we have seen that is v into i right	train
audio_0_113200.wav	I have shown you different different types of Smith Charts so that you know depending upon what is available to you, but this one here is relatively better to you know look at because locate the points because it has a much larger number of circles	train
audio_0_20814.wav	Middle east is also not far behind	train
audio_0_164163.wav	Now given a vector object and a matrix object I want to define a function which will be able to compute the product of them	train
audio_0_29038.wav	so this is the whole ah, ah objective of ah, fog computing, and the whole idea is also to reduce the delay ah that is incurred, ah, ah in sending the data from the sensor device to the cloud, from the cloud getting a response back and activating the particular device	train
audio_0_148826.wav	what are barriers	train
audio_0_107472.wav	If you look at these structures, most of them will not have any seismic resistance feature in terms of what we are talking of these ties, these connections which have to be good and so on	train
audio_0_131168.wav	Now a canary is essentially a random number which the compiler fix from a particular random store and inserts it over here	train
audio_0_25608.wav	And now, therefore, we have the transmitted pilot vector, X bar, we have the observation vector, Y bar	train
audio_0_141098.wav	right, if you choose the proper base quantities which express in per unit values, the equivalent impedance of transformer, whether referred to primary or secondary, is the same	train
audio_0_13698.wav	So, that is why these calculations have been made this is your approximately 31 Volt alpha is equal to I told you it will be tan inverse 5	train
audio_0_14715.wav	So, this is coulomb, this is second so, it will be 1 coulomb per second right	train
audio_0_142753.wav	that is minus j twenty five, right	train
audio_0_157118.wav	3 volts and so on and so forth	train
audio_0_104638.wav	So, I will discuss how physical forces are sensed by cells and how it alters sub cellular biochemistry, and whole cell behavior	train
audio_0_101748.wav	So, this was the first study to demonstrate the relationship between idle size and islands and apoptosis and what it was also shown	train
audio_0_108308.wav	So and you can see that the reactions at the top and the bottom, the difference in the reaction the top and the bottom is because of the eccentricity considered at the base with respect to the hinge which is where F	train
audio_0_155979.wav	If the length D is equal to lambda upon 4, or the electrical angle of the length of transmission line is pi by 2, then what we observe is, when we substitute into the previous expression that I just wrote down	train
audio_0_161556.wav	so the problem as nine variables and eight constraints	train
audio_0_102682.wav	Via forces, mechanical forces exerted by cells expose cryptic sites	train
audio_0_149369.wav	if there is no change, then this is the state of equilibrium	train
audio_0_21412.wav	In the fusion reactions substantial larger amount of energy is also released compared to fission because associated elements are much lighter in mass	train
audio_0_171095.wav	Once the ligands are prepared; then we can use the ligand for calculating the physicochemical properties	train
audio_0_159872.wav	so again to repeat, these are the four assignments	train
audio_0_129857.wav	Then the second thing is that it will improve the adhesion; which means that once you coat on the wafer with the photoresist, you have to perform soft baking	train
audio_0_1377.wav	So in the range image you have both types of ages and that is why the characterization of these ages are important because they are bit different and their processing should be different	train
audio_0_137072.wav	and this is z two, one z two, two, z two, three	train
audio_0_169177.wav	So to bring it to the actual details, suppose I have a base class B, so I have for this base class I have two functions; one is function f and this function g	train
audio_0_18506.wav	It is also more popularly it is known as pv ratio or profit volume ratio	train
audio_0_116093.wav	In fact, it is actually better than that other results because in the other cases we had a longer transmission line	train
audio_0_4875.wav	So, LC will be is equal to 1 upon omega 0 square	train
audio_0_115985.wav	So, matching at the output ports is actually pretty good matching at input port or even this isolation is fairly decent over the desire 890 to 960 megahertz	train
audio_0_142156.wav	so point six, in to minus three, in to two, pi sixty has system in to twenty kilometer the length of the line	train
audio_0_162252.wav	So, it will know how many elements of int type to be created in the memory that needs to be allocated	train
audio_0_151469.wav	Otherwise, it is a, it will converge to for any other value of x, to exactly this exponential function	train
audio_0_10136.wav	So, R L will be R g plus j x g X this you can do yourself	train
audio_0_128002.wav	How fast your device should be	train
audio_0_159655.wav	now by doing this i have got an identity matrix for x three and x four	train
audio_0_154527.wav	Now depending on as I said what the impedance profile or this capital Z as a function of Z is I get various types of tapers	train
audio_0_126234.wav	Let us now see what are the kind of electrical signals, what are the kind of noise present in the electrical signal	train
audio_0_121708.wav	Together they cost the total cost, now if we have a revenue line and so the unit cost minus the variable cost, which is linked that unit production gives us the margin per unit and the total fixed cost divided by that margin per unit gives us the break even volume or the break even sales	train
audio_0_164065.wav	That also can be solved by using a stack, but here we are just showing that, if the postfix expression is given, how do we evaluate it using a stack	train
audio_0_11266.wav	And your phase voltage phase voltage is V p that is your that is your magnitude, magnitude is the phase voltage that is rms value	train
audio_0_125011.wav	Yeah, yes, peak to peak voltage	train
audio_0_160211.wav	we also observe one more thing	train
audio_0_27196.wav	now I can do the following thing: this I can use here: I can use the product rule for the derivatives, so I can use the product rule for computing the derivative and this is simply, therefore, the derivative of: well, the derivative of this is simply well, the derivative of ah	train
audio_0_172365.wav	So, here this is a curve here x axis is the concentration, this is the concentration and y axis is the inhibition	train
audio_0_123389.wav	So, what will be your I B	train
audio_0_127403.wav	So, in case of band pass filter we were cascading low pass filter and high pass filter	train
audio_0_152541.wav	25 so our interval let say from 0 to 2	train
audio_0_120484.wav	So, a customer, your sales person who is having an introduction with the customer in Calcutta should be able to easily transfer this information, that the same customer in Coimbatore or one another part of that organization in Coimbatore may have a similar demand	train
audio_0_113465.wav	Then we took one design problem so where we have taken a one particular substrate and then for characteristic impedances of 100 ohm we can find out the value of w which comes out to be 0	train
audio_0_18257.wav	In modesty, in module 1, that is sessions 1 and 2, we had discussed about what is cost accounting	train
audio_0_143719.wav	so in the process, when they are involving n the each and every step they are, they will develop the resilience	train
audio_0_112050.wav	Now what is a strip line	train
audio_0_109430.wav	So, 67% of DL dead load is what we will consider, this works out to about 38	train
audio_0_119963.wav	So, the touch points or arrival at the hotel, your handling over of the bags to the bell person, your checking in at the front desk, your accessing the room and receiving the bags, your shower and sleep, all of these are touch points service events	train
audio_0_127747.wav	tThat is thea difference	train
audio_0_22536.wav	In this situation we have an administrator who would be running, managing a content review team	train
audio_0_166674.wav	Now, in the middle column, we see an interesting extension of C programming language in C99 standard what C99 came up with	train
audio_0_12606.wav	Actually, it was it was it was circuit was like this know, I am drawing it here	train
audio_0_125357.wav	Now, the one that I am holding in my hand, he will insert it and he will and we can see the display, and we can we can identify whether this is NPN or PNP transistor	train
audio_0_110800.wav	But now there is slight change now we do not give much focus to g l now we focus more on g s value	train
audio_0_21594.wav	So you also must be having access to some sort of digital gadget inside classroom	train
audio_0_171130.wav	We will do this, you ended up with 159 compounds from this 460	train
audio_0_111773.wav	So, here one helical antenna has been designed around 400 megahertz	train
audio_0_119406.wav	You will be on face book, you will be on different other platforms, voicing your concern, voicing your unhappiness and often it will rapidly spread even across the world which we say going viral	train
audio_0_18149.wav	Fix costs are anyway not going to change	train
audio_0_132.wav	So if I take the image of the origin of the world coordinate system, I will get the column vector P4, which means p4 is the image of that coordinate origin	train
audio_0_129825.wav	Here, I have shown you an example how you can use a photoresist and if I have a bright field mask what will happen	train
audio_0_100287.wav	Items that can be calibrated in a model include, let's see in a model what items can be calibrated	train
audio_0_135171.wav	c f actually is the current right, i will come to that right	train
audio_0_130125.wav	Transition region is from pass band to stop band transition region	train
audio_0_111.wav	We have already established this, that camera center, we know the from the projection geometry that camera center is a singular point	train
audio_0_169789.wav	The actual parameters and the formal parameters must match in their order, in their data type and so on	train
audio_0_165831.wav	So, a method norm has a name complex colon colon norm	train
audio_0_153782.wav	This helps us to visualise all passive devices because for all passive devices, R is greater than 0 and that is a convenient way of expressing it	train
audio_0_26344.wav	Now it is easy to see that if I look at the mean of the noise mean of the estimate, that is expected value of H hat	train
audio_0_19277.wav	So, cost control exercise is done, cost reduction is also done so that we have permanent benefit of lesser costs	train
audio_0_163825.wav	It is x is complex, y is complex, so x greater than y will have to be defined for the complex type, if the complex type does not have a x greater than y, that is if the greater than operator has not been overloaded in the complex class	train
audio_0_26858.wav	therefore, what you have is the received output, y is h, which is circularly convolved with x plus v	train
audio_0_129925.wav	I have not changed the circuit because there is no use of changing	train
audio_0_167582.wav	And one way to make the user defined conversion take place is to actually provide an appropriate constructor for the target type from the source type	train
audio_0_163823.wav	This is what it will return	train
audio_0_166028.wav	And in the second line of the cout, we print that is the line here	train
audio_0_23829.wav	Yeah, like gathering, annual day, school day	train
audio_0_163402.wav	If compiler fails to do that, then the compiler will tell you that you are attempting to re declare or you would tell that I am confused and will say that there is ambiguity in that and in such cases, you will have to do something different to make the function overloading work or avoid function overloading and to write the code in a different form	train
audio_0_134084.wav	Now as we seen in the second video today this particular file the example 1 is an elf executable, so we have seen commands such as readelf minus H and we can look at the header of this particular executable and as we have seen in the previous video we would obtain the header for example 1	train
audio_0_126510.wav	So, what is the next step	train
audio_0_24966.wav	That is happy Sam	train
audio_0_141449.wav	in a year, total number of hours is eight seven six zero	train
audio_0_164349.wav	So, this needs to get constructed	train
audio_0_105452.wav	So, typical values if you want to look at the poisons ratio of the unit would be of the order of 0	train
audio_0_108582.wav	As far as permissible tensile stresses are concerned, it continues to be what we used for the unreinforced Masonry Code, which is again if you remember, varies between 0	train
audio_0_156336.wav	So depending on this, certain Classes of amplifiers have been formed	train
audio_0_13142.wav	Previously also if so in t 0 right it may be advanced by time t 0 or delayed by time t 0	train
audio_0_131183.wav	So, then now we invoke this scanf function which reads a string from the user	train
audio_0_134217.wav	So, note that the SECS was created during the ECREATE instruction which was done initially and during the EADD per ECS there will some log which gets appended or added in the ECS	train
audio_0_169914.wav	Now we have moved to the operator overload functions here, overload one is here, exactly like the same way the only thing that has become different is the fact that it now has only the right hand side operand as argument to this function and as a parameter to this function left hand side operand is a object itself	train
audio_0_160225.wav	obviously the contributions of u one, u two and u three to the objective function is also zero	train
audio_0_160608.wav	therefore we try to meet the maximum possible, which is twenty, which is the minimum of this twenty and this twenty five	train
audio_0_21535.wav	How old are you Aditya	train
audio_0_101079.wav	In the last few lectures we discussed about various diseases including cancer ok	train
audio_0_135294.wav	so that's why that electrical that is, that is the electrical power matches the new input power p i	train
audio_0_136441.wav	now, cooperative assistance is one of the planned benefits of interconnected operation, because when three pool power systems are interconnected together	train
audio_0_19776.wav	So, production requirement will be 5,500	train
audio_0_127346.wav	So, we have seen band and we have seen the filters that will pass a band and it will filter out band	train
audio_0_150591.wav	And the function fz is said to have a singularity at this point z naught	train
audio_0_127266.wav	So, what we are saying that because the output when we ground the inverting and non inverting terminal because there is some output of millivolts, we have to apply we have to apply a small voltage at either inverting or non inverting terminal at either inverting or non inverting terminal to make the output voltage 0, you got it	train
audio_0_128107.wav	We are on the semiconductors	train
audio_0_127640.wav	And the load will have extremely low output impedance	train
audio_0_100178.wav	So here similarly, you break the project activities into smaller and smaller components, then stop when you get to what to be done by one person in one or two weeks	train
audio_0_164936.wav	Now, that is what I have violated	train
audio_0_133650.wav	Now the integral statements in this function over here are these 2 here it is definition of chunk size which is taken from the header, so the header is present in the MP4 file and could be set by the attacker	train
audio_0_168367.wav	So, we are saying corrected end of session, you could have just called it c or d or a, but it is better to give it in name from which it can be understood as to what the variable means	train
audio_0_127782.wav	So, same RC filters can be used in some different configurations to get us a band stop filter or attenuate the frequency that we do not desire all right	train
audio_0_166603.wav	Of course, this should be noted that later version of C that is C99 does allow you to defer the declaration of variables to like in C++ to the point when you actually need the variable	train
audio_0_2901.wav	So, we will get E b is equal to V minus I a into R S plus r a; R S is the series field resistance	train
audio_0_119514.wav	And every day, they deliver the previous day’s empty tiffin box and pick up the freshly loaded tiffin box, 75 kilometers of public transport mainly the suburban railway system of Bombay, almost acts as a food trunk line	train
audio_0_150949.wav	Well, so, moreover the above Fourier cosine or sine integral converges	train
audio_0_137447.wav	but that is for short line and for this one you have seen that current sending end actually leading the your voltage right	train
audio_0_21339.wav	So, the concept of binding energy is probably the most important one to understand the origin of the nuclear energy	train
audio_0_20091.wav	Volume here refers to quantity	train
audio_0_134659.wav	So, we can verify that it indeed has changed by printing out the result the contents of that particular file	train
audio_0_167975.wav	Welcome to Module 28 of Programming in C++	train
audio_0_21124.wav	They are sometimes called as water boilers do not get confused with boiling water reactor which is a common type of nuclear reactor, water boiler refers to this AHR, because the water molecules that can be present inside the reactor, they can go through a kind of decomposition process when that is subjected to the radiation, such kind of radioactive decomposes, because of such kind of radioactive decomposition hydrogen and oxygen bubbles may appear inside this reactor; that is why they are called water boilers	train
audio_0_110194.wav	Now the other aspect that does have a role to play which very often we don't give enough attention to is you have a wall, you have boundary conditions that are the real boundary conditions that occur because of the construction detailing and typology	train
audio_0_123725.wav	And then we will see that in truth or practically what is the case	train
audio_0_3106.wav	But how to remember I will simplify it; this way if you just make it like this, the R 1 R 2 plus R 2 R 3 plus R 3 R 1; all the case numerator in this case is same	train
audio_0_25280.wav	This is the equaliser operation	train
audio_0_113470.wav	So, I prefer generally micro strip circuit	train
audio_0_137443.wav	so this is your i s from the reference line ten point two, three degree	train
audio_0_167323.wav	Where you encapsulate in two ways, one you encapsulate by packaging multiple data members in terms of an object, and only try to provide a set of behaviour, set of member functions to that	train
audio_0_104749.wav	In contrast alpha actinin 4 is associated with enhanced motility of breast cancer cells	train
audio_0_152396.wav	So, we are bisecting the given interval into two equal parts by taking this as x naught which is the middle point of the two end points and then the algorithm will go as follows	train
audio_0_100949.wav	So, having a nucleus, the nucleus is get fill like a stone inside itself because it has all the DNA which is forced inside a 5 micron diameter, 5 micron size nucleus	train
audio_0_10315.wav	And therefore, X is equal to your we know now X square just hold on	train
audio_0_129200.wav	So, this experiment shows how to calculate the gain of a differential amplifier; we chose differential amplifier because it takes a difference of voltages; amplifier because we can change the gain of the voltage that is difference of voltage by changing the value of feedback resistor and the input resistor	train
audio_0_150881.wav	So, using this property, we will get this half and cos hyperbolic and this t will be replaced by t by 2 that means we will have instead of 4 t we will have just 2 t	train
audio_0_148899.wav	so the point	train
audio_0_131621.wav	In addition to the bugs in the system software, you could also have bugs in other applications that are present	train
audio_0_115535.wav	So, now, instead of taking isotropic elements, let us take horizontal dipole over here and horizontal dipole over here	train
audio_0_103211.wav	So, all the forces are being exerted by the cell in the X Y plane which is not necessarily true	train
audio_0_105938.wav	So this small amount of tension that you can account for can help you overcome situations where small amount of tension is coming into your cross section and you can optimize the cross section dimension itself	train
audio_0_115272.wav	So, if you just remove that now the fabrication will not lead to much of a alignment error at all and you can get a much better result	train
audio_0_3371.wav	And you will find; that means, you will operate in between your what you call this point to this point the slip value right somewhere it is full load operating point	train
audio_0_112423.wav	So, this radiates at it is a broadside antenna	train
audio_0_115600.wav	So, let us say we want desired beam to be along phi equal to 60 degree	train
audio_0_20980.wav	And from the discovery of that neutral element was done by James Chadwick in 1932	train
audio_0_16442.wav	This way you can write	train
audio_0_164040.wav	So, to create a stack in C, we need to do; these are the common steps that we will need to follow	train
audio_0_16353.wav	now this ah actually it will be is this is the charge on 20 micro farad and 30 micro farad capacitor because they are in series with 300 voltage source right	train
audio_0_3459.wav	So, now we will study your DC motor, but principle of a generator very simple it is, whatever write up is there it is just I am telling	train
audio_0_170660.wav	So, use this alignment and predict the secondary structure either the use the GOR method or they can use the ensemble based information from known structures	train
audio_0_25992.wav	so this is basically what is this YL	train
audio_0_119996.wav	Other interesting you try to create catchy communications text, you try to highlight that people or the key differentiate, this because the service intangible often becomes tangible at the touch point by the attitude, by the smartness or by the callousness of the service provider	train
audio_0_100720.wav	So, because the dystrophin gene is not produced the entire dystroglycan complex is missing and in this case the linkage is only through the integrin, integrins ok	train
audio_0_116676.wav	Now, let us look into what are the radiation hazards from cell tower and what are the possible solution	train
audio_0_109459.wav	We use the effective area of steel to then check if we are satisfying the requirements that the stress in steel is less than the permissible stress and whether the stress in masonry is less than the permissible stress in masonry	train
audio_0_130761.wav	So, that way we have to be careful with this push and POP instruction while writing the subroutines	train
audio_0_111112.wav	Of course, there is a microwave bomb also	train
audio_0_121592.wav	This again is often called difficult particularly for service providers like doctors or management professionals or consultants or legal professionals	train
audio_0_164949.wav	So, force casting is a dangerous thing	train
audio_0_116880.wav	In fact, I also want to mention that in addition to this, overhead high voltage transmission line which carry 50 hertz or 60 hertz	train
audio_0_105695.wav	So this code becomes important	train
audio_0_168203.wav	But using operator overloading, we can define like the operator plus we can say is the add of complex numbers, this is subtraction of complex number, multiplication of complex number, division of complex number	train
audio_0_119540.wav	So, you can see here, there is a kind of a emerging battle between or among networks	train
audio_0_131974.wav	Later on, Biham actually developed differential fault analysis attack on the block cipher desk and also there were other different types of fault attack like the optical fault induction attacks by Anderson which was published in CHES 2002	train
audio_0_109128.wav	You are not able to dissipate energy by rocking alone	train
audio_0_3908.wav	So, this is also creating another super mesh	train
audio_0_131453.wav	However, to get a better alignment what we do is we add some Nops initially so the Nops is present by this opcode is given by this opcode 90 and whenever the processor sees this opcode of 90 it is just going to skip the instruction to nothing in that instruction	train
audio_0_169969.wav	Now this is not possible	train
audio_0_101519.wav	And the last class spoke about Soft lithography and using this you can regulate cell shape or you can use micro pillars, you can fabricate micro pillars for traction as an alternative to TFM	train
audio_0_2077.wav	So you and you have both source and detector co located because the point from where you are transmitting you are also detecting at the same location	train
audio_0_121488.wav	So, customer comes in, customers entry, there is some kind of delay, so this can be the reception, this can be the table booking system, this can be the ticket booking system, whatever	train
audio_0_115677.wav	So, total length of the array will be equal to 4 lambda	train
audio_0_130106.wav	So, you can see a sharp cut and it looks like a wall	train
audio_0_126283.wav	So, when you see this symbol here right this is under root	train
audio_0_167022.wav	If I call c dot g 5 then it I would expect that base 2 colon colon g will be called, but unfortunately the compiler would not be able to do that	train
audio_0_158130.wav	So 2 volts, 3 volts something will be dropped	train
audio_0_167223.wav	In contrast, in union, it is the allocation is done in memory for only the largest component	train
audio_0_169503.wav	So, what this tells us	train

audio_0_2745.wav	So, multiply 3 into 10 power 9 with, 3 into 10 raised to the power 9 multiplied by this particular term, that will give you 528	train
audio_0_158931.wav	complimentary slackness also tells us that there is a relationship between x and v and y and u	train
audio_0_4677.wav	Windage and friction loss right fictional loss sometimes we called is a rotational loss that will be given few percen[tage] some percentage of this right	train
audio_0_3588.wav	And this is the direction, this is the armature, armature is marked here this is the armature right	train
audio_0_2433.wav	So, one of them is that the manually inserted spray head is not inserted enough; obviously, when you are talking about doors of assembly, and you see here how difficult it is for the operator to actually take a wax nozzles, which may be otherwise you know something like this with a probably a nozzle gun	train
audio_0_21330.wav	Then, there has to have some kind of nuclear force, which opposes this electrostatic repulsion and keeps the nucleons together	train
audio_0_135310.wav	rotor will start decelerating till it achieves its synchronous speed, say at point c	train
audio_0_128377.wav	So, do not worry when you look at something which is complex the operation is really simple, all right	train

audio_0_15404.wav	For example, I want to bring this one this side this side my power glass will be the current magnitude this is I 2 square is the magnitude in to R 2 to this is a power glass, right	train
audio_0_148805.wav	the more we communicate, the more there is the need to communicate	train
audio_0_155922.wav	Now for B2 for the even mode, the voltage that appears at port 2 is A1 upon 2 and for odd mode the voltage that, the signal, I beg your pardon, I should notsay voltage, it is a normalised voltage, the normalised voltage that appears at port 2 is A1 upon 2	train
audio_0_164256.wav	So, that has given rise to defining a new kind of access specifier known as protected	train
audio_0_4440.wav	So now this is your A, B, and C this is actually 3 phases are there A B C 3 phase's right, 3 phase's are there so it is schematically it is shown	train

audio_0_1875.wav	Even a slight change in those estimation slight error will cause appearance of no different kinds of colors	train
audio_0_123689.wav	Even if op amp has infinite input gain what is the maximum output you get at the output of the operational amplifier, we will see we will see ok	train
audio_0_123482.wav	So, you see here that if vdd is my voltage this is ground	train
audio_0_4593.wav	So, circuit model is same as a transformer say E1 upon E 2 is equal to a, a is given N1 upon N2 and the current your I 2 dash upon I 2 is equal to 1 upon a right	train
audio_0_133964.wav	Now with a Fine Grained confinement to within a process what we actually achieved is creating one compartment like this, so code that runs within this compartment is restricted by these boundaries of this particular compartment	train
audio_0_16301.wav	Therefore 1 upon Ceq when capacitors are in series, it is 1 upon C 1 plus 1 upon C 2 plus 1 upon C 3 plus 1 upon C N right	train
audio_0_114816.wav	So, in civil application, we have a wireless communication mobile communication is part of this particular thing, here FM radio, AM radio, all the broadcasts are basically one way communication	train
audio_0_124492.wav	This is how we can grow the thermal oxide	train
audio_0_170450.wav	So, you should have at least 100 sequences for calculating the conservation score	train
audio_0_18645.wav	First of all, you all know that budget is an estimated statement	train
audio_0_141926.wav	so it is this two, not touch the limit	train
audio_0_167493.wav	Look at another case of a trying to convert this pointer to double into integer	train
audio_0_159906.wav	subtracting nine, from the every element of the third row, you'll get zero, one, two, three	train
audio_0_151169.wav	So this property holds for if we take two even functions, their product will be also even	train
audio_0_21630.wav	It means you feel you are study material is coming to you Yes	train
audio_0_415.wav	So the very basic property that if you get two corresponding image points of the same scene point then they are related by this particular relationship	train
audio_0_26577.wav	I am going to replace this by norm of V bar square And there is an important point	train
audio_0_107602.wav	It is important that it is flat but the manufacturing process may result in undulations in the top and the bottom surface	train
audio_0_164354.wav	Here, what the base class construct, sorry, the derive class constructor is doing	train
audio_0_151518.wav	We have the equality there	train
audio_0_16061.wav	So, whatever we have done	train
audio_0_102472.wav	So, when they consider the mobile proteins, they had repair proteins repair factors, transcription associated proteins transcription factors, and epigenetic factors as well as nucleus	train
audio_0_112558.wav	So, we have made all the connections you can see	train
audio_0_10278.wav	This power is actually consumed by the load if you look into that 20 square into 7	train
audio_0_115036.wav	Triangular waveform generation can be realized either using by triple five timer or by using Op amp circuit	train
audio_0_10745.wav	So, it is a valid connection this is a valid connection at they are connected across terminal 1 2 so, it is a valid connection	train
audio_0_131065.wav	Therefore, the end start would give you the time taken to execute these instructions, rdtsc function are received over here uses something known as the rdtsc instruction which is supported by all Intel platforms or Intel processors	train
audio_0_15722.wav	For example, suppose at your residence the bulb is there tube light is there these are all represented by power	train
audio_0_150163.wav	So, we have for instance, here if you want to find the Laplace transform of 2 power t, again this function can be converted into this known transforms	train
audio_0_126958.wav	It is extremely small um, and it is measured under a condition that input voltage to the op amp is 0, right	train
audio_0_141106.wav	because that, suppose, suppose at generating station, say may be, your voltage is stepped up from generator terminal voltage, say ten point six k v, ten point six k v to two twenty k v	train
audio_0_147609.wav	sometimes we are going to picnic or some places and places and casually we meet some body, may be in the train, may be at the airport, and just say hi, hello, and asking the name: where are you going	train
audio_0_141302.wav	you have to choose a common volt ampere base	train
audio_0_151392.wav	Then we will extend naturally this f x as an even function in the whole interval minus L to L	train
audio_0_114147.wav	Generally speaking vacuum tubes contains one cathode, one anode and one or more than one grids	train
audio_0_139153.wav	this one is your equality constraint, right, this one we are bringing into this augmented cost function	train
audio_0_165570.wav	So you will still need to use for those cases, but for your own code you will never need to use any of the C error handling or C standard library functions	train
audio_0_150440.wav	So, the accuracy is more or less concentrated around this point of expansion that is the one point here we should not	train
audio_0_13363.wav	Or if voltage is reaching 0 before the current; that means, voltage is leading the your what you call current other way is, other way that current is your reaching peak later than the voltage; that means, current lags from the voltage	train
audio_0_24804.wav	That is our first persona, ok	train
audio_0_104914.wav	So, you had wrote Y31 and Y118 phosphorylated and more importantly it is localization was sensitive to contractility	train
audio_0_15465.wav	So, I 2 dash is compute 40 ampere and it is 0	train
audio_0_154735.wav	They have all described in terms of lumped elements	train
audio_0_168231.wav	But here you are you will see only one parameter for operator plus, because since this a operator function is a member function the first operand or the left hand side operand the left operand of the operator is a object on which you are invoking the operator function	train
audio_0_11897.wav	Suppose, if you have let me delete, if you have look at this look at this your what you call just hold on, suppose if you have here I have made it initially here	train
audio_0_17268.wav	So, you know the direct material, labor and variable overheads which is 889 for product A	train
audio_0_994.wav	So the dot product of between these two vectors should be equal to 0 so this gives me two equations is that are linear equations in terms of s and t so if you solve and you can get s and t at the point so this is how we can solve this problem and we can get the structure let us consider the other problem of line reconstruction	train
audio_0_154822.wav	The reason we can do this is because we are only considering a single level reflection which means that one reflection is happening due to the mismatch between z1& z2 & the other reflection at the low level	train
audio_0_172154.wav	How many alanines	train
audio_0_127068.wav	Vd would be equal to V at the non inverting terminal and minus V at the inverting terminal; it is the differential voltage	train

audio_0_4914.wav	That is your the from this am not going to the phasor diagram	train
audio_0_12007.wav	Here it is i 1, i 2, i 3 for this is square because this is a square right	train
audio_0_167219.wav	But what is different is the way the memory is allocated	train
audio_0_118485.wav	So, this is the basic schematic of helix travelling wave tube	train
audio_0_116018.wav	So, let us see now what is S 21, S 31, this is now minus 3	train
audio_0_104391.wav	So, that completes our initial understanding of what focal adhesions are	train
audio_0_3683.wav	So that means, that means whenever this the when you are bringing this conductor say bringing this it is given N S, N S like this	train
audio_0_136249.wav	so y capital y one, four is equal to y four is zero	train
audio_0_150844.wav	So instead of t now if we have now at there then we can just adjust here 1 over s and the Laplace transform this F s where s is replaced by also s divided by a	train
audio_0_170722.wav	So, λ is the wavelength	train
audio_0_163050.wav	So, we start from t take a character and go waste number of times because we know waste number of bytes exist	train
audio_0_16961.wav	So, that means, if you if you come to this at t is equal to short circuiting action of the capacitor, right	train
audio_0_131447.wav	Test code will list and we put a breakpoint in line number 5 and run it with some input say A’s ok	train
audio_0_171342.wav	So, these interactions are mainly dominant electrostatic and van der Waals interactions	train
audio_0_24526.wav	Add more of adding his previous knowledge to this	train
audio_0_21332.wav	So, that its influence is limited, only inside the nucleus and it must be strong enough to oppose the electrostatic repulsion and that is where the concept of binding energy comes into the picture	train
audio_0_163830.wav	So, that if you want to pass some user defined type want to instantiate with some user defined type your user defined type will have to satisfy those properties	train
audio_0_118452.wav	So, we have two hybrids 90 degree hybrids; one is the RF 90 degree hybrid, another is the IF 90 degree hybrid	train
audio_0_106657.wav	And it's only in 2016 when the National Building Code introduced a section on reinforced masonry that we formally adopted this as a structural system almost 100 years later	train
audio_0_155354.wav	One interesting application of the Smith chart is to read impedances and impedance transformation	train
audio_0_24236.wav	This way there is no touching and you just have to ask Porthos to move around and he would make the measurements quite accurately	train
audio_0_25255.wav	and this is your vector v bar of k, which is r cross 1	train
audio_0_127876.wav	And let us see the change in the output voltage when we apply different signal at the input voltage all right	train
audio_0_126328.wav	And the voltage is as high as 100 microvolts lasts for several milliseconds	train
audio_0_115084.wav	The reasons will be obvious after we cover the basic concept of this	train
audio_0_19226.wav	With this we are also completing our course of 10 hours	train
audio_0_169564.wav	Before highlighting what we want to specify for the C languages as such, let us just briefly understand this example; because this is an explanation by example	train
audio_0_11070.wav	So, if you integrate from this one this one, because these term actually will vanish	train
audio_0_107862.wav	There is this interesting flow chart which then actually captures how you go about estimating the lateral capacity and make checks on whether the structure would be able to survive or fail under a given level of seismic excitation	train
audio_0_136487.wav	you know light fans, ac and other thing, geezer, another things, right	train
audio_0_162452.wav	We have not written how integer is getting change to double or it could be situations where I will need to say the user will need to define how through the casting the change will happen	train
audio_0_126982.wav	Now these are we are balancing our amplifier it it is very important, that you balance your operation amplifier before you start working on different kind of circuits, all right	train
audio_0_128284.wav	The second line, we already discussed and the final one is the key to success is action and essential and the essential in action is perseverance	train
audio_0_143561.wav	the inner eyebrows more or less maintain their position and he muscles over here raised	train
audio_0_167516.wav	In static cast, interestingly this is ok, why is it, because the compiler reasons that since you have taken a address of A type object and you are trying to put it to a B type pointer you know that you are going down in the hierarchy	train
audio_0_112733.wav	The reason for that is the S parameters of a device are defined when you put match load at the input or output side, over here it is not terminated with the match load; but it is actually terminated with some unknown load impedance Z L	train
audio_0_11623.wav	Therefore, this one; that means, this this ah triangle is there it is I it is I cos theta, I sin theta for all these things for all these arm you multiply by V	train
audio_0_126034.wav	Let me write it down here	train
audio_0_105821.wav	However, it is essential that it is verified against this minimum requirement of design force itself	train
audio_0_124245.wav	Now, if you see here on the screen what you see	train
audio_0_123163.wav	So, this way this very easy to understand	train
audio_0_169514.wav	That protocol still continues	train
audio_0_28048.wav	These are the time domain channel taps of the ISI channel and these are, of course, the coefficients on the pilot subcarriers	train

audio_0_167116.wav	This program starts with two strings that are defined within the program the hello world and we want to concatenate the second string after the first string	train
audio_0_4919.wav	Similarly V ab upon V ca if you make, you will get V L angle 30, while V L angle minus 210 degree, you will get V ca is equal to V ab angle minus 250 40 degree or you add 360 with that other way V ca is equal to V ab angle 120 degree right, this is the relationship	train
audio_0_136111.wav	right, and the assume m v a three phase, we will, and k v a is line to line, because for single phase rating was one, m v a is single phase, now three, single phase connected	train
audio_0_103475.wav	So, coming to the question of whether a biopolymer network is a solid or a liquid	train
audio_0_164881.wav	So, casting you know is basically performed when a value of one type, certain type is used in place some other type is used in the context of some other type	train
audio_0_136301.wav	similarly, this one: now you can, you can, i am telling you you can check this one	train
audio_0_169556.wav	Any recursive functions will have a recursive step and one or more exit condition to end the recursion	train

audio_0_132972.wav	So, here we have actually said some of the few parameters present in the Elf header	train
audio_0_171679.wav	Now, also there are we can derive various sequence based parameters	train
audio_0_1995.wav	And when you are testing that model with another set of data which is which has been kept outside of this training set but in the test set we know the actual values that means ground truths values and we compare those values with the predicted values then we get also an error by those comparisons that we call test error	train
audio_0_140639.wav	so suppose, suppose this d s is: take any conductor, d s is first, you will take its r dash right	train
audio_0_141271.wav	so, in this equation, in this equation twenty six, in equation twenty six, we, what we are doing is that we are substituting d one is equal to r, d one is equal to r and d two is equal to d in equation twenty six	train
audio_0_104949.wav	When the same experiment was done with C57 and MDX what was observed was Compared to the response of C57 cells	train

audio_0_171449.wav	Then second we can validate with the MD simulations; do the different MD simulation structures	train
audio_0_155453.wav	Otherwise, you need to choose a different value of gamma L and repeat this whole process again	train
audio_0_146627.wav	so therefore, in the context of the organization, innovation is the interplay between individual creativity and environmental creativity	train

audio_0_4874.wav	So, you will get 1 upon your 1 upon omega 1 plus 1 upon omega 2 your by C minus your what you call omega 1 plus omega 2 is equal to 0 or simply you will get 1 upon omega 1 omega 2 is equal to LC is equal to 1 upon omega 0 square because your because omega 0 is equal to resonance frequency is equal to 1 upon root over LC If you take the square of it	train
audio_0_165715.wav	This is the kind of problem that you can get into if you do not distinguish between shallow and deep copy	train
audio_0_121835.wav	And; obviously, like we were talking about segmentation which is so linked to positioning, segmentation needs the kind of analysis like the size of the segment, it is growth rate, measurability, accessibility, the segment may be very attractive, but do you have the proper kind of infrastructure to access, that segment	train
audio_0_104297.wav	So, with that I stop here	train

audio_0_24741.wav	So the customer could be wherever they are and their vehicle could be better, we do not need the customer to come all the way to the workshop which is the root of the problem really, and that it is not the distance from customer location but distance that the customer travels	train
audio_0_4470.wav	Like your magnetic field you can feel it, but you cannot visualise cu[rrent] voltage current you can see the wave form other things you, but you can feel it, but you cannot see in your open eyes only you can see that wave form right	train
audio_0_167905.wav	So what happens, plus plus has the highest precedence over is a higher precedence than multiplication, so both plus plus has happen before multiplication has happened so, a was 3 it first becomes 4 then it becomes 5 and then the multiplication happens	train
audio_0_152585.wav	The more formally mathematically the idea is that we can have a normal at any point and that will be in the two directions	train
audio_0_113803.wav	By 200, I had mentioned that we should choose l plus d equal to 0	train

audio_0_20909.wav	Of course, in case of incase of coal based power stations, we burn the fuel and the exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the surrounding, leading to environmental pollution, and such kind of greenhouse emission is absent in case of nuclear because there is no chemical reaction involved	train
audio_0_156043.wav	Now this module was of course on broadband impedance matching, and we see that with a quarter wave transformer you can get only a certain band width	train

audio_0_106221.wav	So, it's an idealization that we said we're getting one way flexure in vertical bending or horizontal bending	train
audio_0_107625.wav	So, the starting point is again as far as the seismic design is concerned, you have the design configuration, the plan configuration that you have arrived at and we have to choose the type of system that we want to actually design which then leads us to what sort of a response reduction factor can you use in the design and arrive at the horizontal seismic coefficient which then determines what is the total base here that the structure is going to be designed for	train
audio_0_152285.wav	So, here again the finding u or v the Cauchy Riemann equations play important role	train

audio_0_168731.wav	There are four data members assumed and I have not used any access specifier after the beginning of the class definition here which means that by default these data members are private there in, and these data members are intended in a way that the first data members read write is a data member which, as I being a data member it is private so nobody can directly come and change its value, but in terms of its use I would like to read and write its value	train
audio_0_107653.wav	So, that is where you have the first contributory factor we designate ductility with the factor mu, displacement ductility is what we are basically referring to where this displacement ductility of the structure is nothing but because it is now going on almost horizontal the ratio of delta u to delta y	train
audio_0_16742.wav	You know that	train
audio_0_115120.wav	But just to tell you the derivations are there in many of the books you can have a quick look into that , but here we want to tell you the concept part	train

audio_0_152329.wav	This is a so called arbitrary function of x	train
audio_0_13280.wav	Sorry, now when theta is equal to 0 right when theta is equal to 0, then A B is equal to 0, then A B is equal to your what you call is equal 0	train
audio_0_107060.wav	And the load acting is the axial force with a certain eccentricity	train
audio_0_151067.wav	So therefore, we have the we call it a scalar field	train

audio_0_112186.wav	So, that can be used for coupling to resonator or that gap can be also used for biasing the network Let us look at some other discontinuities there may be a step in the width	train
audio_0_143894.wav	but the fundamentally issue involved over here is that persuasion takes place because arjuna, in some way or the other, is convinced that whatever lord krishna is telling is the truth	train
audio_0_132233.wav	Now with this allocation and other 120 bytes what ptmalloc has done is used one of these chunks which are in the free list and therefore our free list now just comes down to having just three memory chunks present	train
audio_0_101919.wav	So, now let us see how will the force velocity relationship look for a network	train
audio_0_132767.wav	So what the attacker could do is that he could actually connect an oscilloscope and tap out the power consumed by the device and therefore as the device is executing the attacker would be able to monitor the amount of power consumed by that device	train
audio_0_152241.wav	So for the differentiability we want to check its differentiability at z equal to 0 we need to again apply this fundamental definition f z minus f 0 divided by z	train
audio_0_17479.wav	That's why you have got multiple BPs, but there is no multiple PV ratio	train
audio_0_118278.wav	So, we have this time varying diode conductance waveform, which has fundamental frequency of omega LO	train
audio_0_131276.wav	The issue with this is that now I would have two devices, and both can be authenticated by the same server because they would have the same private key in them, essentially both are clones of each other	train
audio_0_140900.wav	ah, that's why i have written it is not over sixty six k v is a short line model on a power phase basis	train
audio_0_132038.wav	With this way the attacker would obtain 1 bit of the secret key	train

audio_0_27865.wav	Hello, Welcome to another module in this massive open online course on ëEstimation for Wireless Communicationí Right	train
audio_0_166368.wav	Now certainly if I make them private then there comes a question of how do I manipulate it	train
audio_0_169273.wav	As you come to C object what you have done you have overridden g	train
audio_0_138641.wav	so if you look this kind of diagram, when you will, i mean this kind of thing this loop itself is isolated from this side or this side because it is a circulated, your circulating current	train
audio_0_139113.wav	it is fifty megawatt rating, so it is twelve point five megawatt	train
audio_0_131910.wav	So, let us consider the case where we have code present outside the enclave, and it is making a memory access to data which is also present outside the enclave	train
audio_0_116800.wav	So, let us just look at it here	train
audio_0_11804.wav	This is from your physics you know right	train
audio_0_132644.wav	So, what we see is that the speculation could possibly improve the performance of the program	train
audio_0_170750.wav	Secondly, in earlier days the crystallographers or the using NMR spectroscopy they solve the structures and they publish and then deposit in the databank	train
audio_0_165105.wav	Simply, so another football has got created, strdup we have done duplicate	train
audio_0_101876.wav	So, as a consequence you can track the deflection as a function of time, and you would get a deflection profile which is something like this and the force, so, once it plateaus; that means, from this curve we can get the speed or velocity and the force as well	train
audio_0_25331.wav	1 bar 2 minus H transpose C bar, that is, minimises the squared norm of the squared norm of this error and this equaliser C bar is found as the least squares solution	train

audio_0_153185.wav	We will see just a short proof but only in this way that we will assume that the given vector field is conservative and then we will prove that it's curl is zero	train
audio_0_168303.wav	And before that the incrimination of the operation has already happened	train
audio_0_117237.wav	So, this is S 21, S 22, S 23, S 31, S 32, S 33	train
audio_0_151722.wav	So, instead of evaluating this 0 to infinity usual this Laplace integral which says that 0 to infinity e power minus s t and f t dt	train
audio_0_135287.wav	it's cutting here this sin curve, that is your power, your power curve at this point	train
audio_0_121131.wav	So, customer needs 4G and you have do not have 4G then; obviously, customer will switch	train
audio_0_142402.wav	now, this is magnitude i cos five and magnitude i sign phi	train
audio_0_149677.wav	But that is also justified because if we take a look at the definition so Delta x minus a if we integrate from 0 to t what we will get we will get the Heaviside function	train
audio_0_15487.wav	So, calculate the equivalent resistance and reactance of low voltage side in terms of high voltage side, b, equivalent resistance and reactance of high voltage side in terms of low voltage side both side you have to get it, right	train
audio_0_110720.wav	So, then you can design amplifier using these parameters for either best possible noise figure or best possible gain or maybe we may compromise between the two	train
audio_0_29025.wav	so can we do something which is better than cloud	train
audio_0_111801.wav	So, what we do, we take C lambda between 0	train
audio_0_18936.wav	39 minus all the total payments which is 9,200	train

audio_0_116788.wav	If you ignore these things , not things become even more serious	train
audio_0_173660.wav	difference in different binding force which one is the best Best one right you can see it is accurately calculated binding affinity	train
audio_0_109915.wav	Of course, this failure plane is going to be affected by the relative strengths that we have considered here, the value of cohesion, the value of friction coefficient, the value of tensile strength of the unit, the value of failure crushing strength of masonry and it is also going to be dependent on the ratio delta x by delta y	train
audio_0_170728.wav	Then for the case of membrane proteins right in 1988 Deisenhofer right Michel and Huber they solve the structures of the membrane; first membrane protein right the photosynthetic reaction center and they got Nobel Prize in 1988	train
audio_0_169465.wav	I tried to do star p A, I got an exception attempted a typeid of null pointer	train
audio_0_142346.wav	off load means you have to disconnect the load from the transformer, then you have to change the tap	train
audio_0_163606.wav	Because if it is private then the class alone can change it, class alone has a rights to change it and if it is an implementation the class alone should be concerned with it, others should not be concerned with what is there in the implementation	train
audio_0_136722.wav	return has v three, p one is equal to zero point zero, two, one, seven, angle two, twenty nine point two degree, by v three, p conjugate, minus point four, seven, angle, hundred seventy five point six degree, into v one	train
audio_0_150734.wav	So, together with the Laplace transform we will be also listing here for inverse Laplace transform because these results are just the analog of the forward properties there	train

audio_0_154193.wav	The waveguide has to be basically designed to produce an impedance matching	train
audio_0_10261.wav	If you simplify, it will become V 2, V 2 dash will become here it is 190; 190 192	train
audio_0_1992.wav	So regarding this, when you are evaluating the performance of a model, there are two particular type of errors, those you should know	train
audio_0_159205.wav	however, we observe something interesting happening: that a non basics c j minus z j, which is corresponding to this variable, corresponding to this variable, now has a zero	train
audio_0_173392.wav	So, this is another example, if you see one gap and here this is aligned C and G are aligned	train
audio_0_129861.wav	Third is that it will improve the uniformity, fourth is that it will improve the etch resistance and fifth is it will optimize the light absorbance	train
audio_0_173018.wav	So, the 2 different types of learning algorithms right we discussed different types of learning algorithms, one is supervised learning and unsupervised learning	train
audio_0_107197.wav	And we will begin design in the next lecture	train
audio_0_154067.wav	So ABCD parameters, they might look like any other circuit parameters like like the impedance or the admittance parameters, they are used quite extensively, especially when, since in microwave circuit analysis, it is convenient to analyse a circuit and terms of Cascade elements rather than considering the whole element as one	train
audio_0_23559.wav	One thing is the time that he takes to prepare obviously becomes low because	train
audio_0_163278.wav	Matrix is a two dimensional square matrix that we have taken here in this example	train

audio_0_119148.wav	So, they can increase the number of first class seats or business class seats reducing the number of economy seats	train
audio_0_166204.wav	But, think of, if you are, if the parameter that you are passing is possibly a structure which may have say 10 kilo byte of size having 200 different members, 200 different components, then copying that itself may be a lot of cost	train
audio_0_26058.wav	So what we said is basically: inter symbol interference is caused by the fact that XK minus one, which is the transmitted symbol at time K minus one, is interfering with XK, which is the present symbol	train
audio_0_20695.wav	Other is this T 135, and iodine 135 both can be produced in fission, actually T 135 has an extremely small half life only 19 seconds	train
audio_0_4095.wav	And phase a b c is given this neutral dash line is given, it may be there may not be there you right may be there or may not be there	train
audio_0_158258.wav	Then B phase takes over which is D3	train
audio_0_26081.wav	they are loaded on to the four subcarriers	train
audio_0_13400.wav	So, that mean this one actually can be written as V angle phi	train
audio_0_169493.wav	A typical declaration will look like this; funct is the name of the function	train
audio_0_128212.wav	The step is there because the film thickness is very large compared to thin film	train
audio_0_1962.wav	So, I will sum all this squared deviation, square of errors and take the mean	train
audio_0_143772.wav	but in the new case, what is the reality	train
audio_0_111607.wav	So, this is TE 0 1 mode	train
audio_0_15822.wav	Therefore, we can write in general sigma power is equal to 0 sigma p is equal to 0 our meaning is in a circuit you may have many voltage sources and many electrical elements right	train
audio_0_13552.wav	So, this this resultant current actually leading this 1 by your 40	train
audio_0_131730.wav	Next, we see what happens when we actually execute a program that uses this particular library	train
audio_0_154308.wav	Hello, welcome to another module of this course, in NPTEL mocks program, microwave integrated circuits	train

audio_0_157775.wav	You try to fire it at alpha, I started as though the current is starting at alpha but it is not true because here it is going beyond alpha which means the same thing should have been true as far as the positive half cycle is also concerned	train
audio_0_21826.wav	That is how I am doing	train
audio_0_109668.wav	So, in this scenario when the roof diaphragm starts playing a significant role in the integral action of the masonry building, the stiffness of the diaphragm, what we are referring to is the in plain stiffness of the diaphragm matters and matters significantly	train
audio_0_118936.wav	So, we would have titled therefore this section as you see on your screen, delivering services in cyberspace	train
audio_0_115270.wav	So, this way what will happen you just you know take it knife and cut it on	train
audio_0_119853.wav	But, this in itself, if there was no interaction that happened with the customer's service representative, if that person had not recognize that, yes it is a lapse and yes, we will set it right and yes, we must see that is are your rewarded and for a bearing with us and etc	train
audio_0_117954.wav	So, at 1 gigahertz wave length will be 30 centimeter	train
audio_0_101685.wav	So, this was PDMS was also used for making some of the gels, hydrogels, but in this case PDMS is used for making the masks not the you know the patterns	train
audio_0_104554.wav	So, the fibrillar collagens are present in high content in those tissues where lots of forces get generated	train
audio_0_16588.wav	So, L into d i L upon dt is equal to V m sin omega t right	train
audio_0_136157.wav	if i see calculator phasing, error always may be there, but i will request you make it off your own right, all this calculation	train
audio_0_156513.wav	So coming back to our curve here, if the group velocity is constant, then there will be no distortion or dispersion between frequencies	train
audio_0_114891.wav	So, again what we need now if filter and then amplifier this whole thing goes to the demodulator this demodulator is opposite of modulator	train
audio_0_172681.wav	So, it will cut the last digit; I mean do that, so now if you want to write any records in order; you can use this specific formats for this string you use s; for the integer we use d and the decimal we use f and it should match the fields	train
audio_0_17490.wav	We had done two illustrations about calculation of contribution PV ratio BP and on	train
audio_0_106018.wav	And if it gets disturbed, disturbed in the sense, if there are other loads that come within that area or under what, what conditions will you consider only the triangular area, equal to triangular area, is what we will examine in a moment	train
audio_0_107082.wav	Once the base share is estimated for a given building, this base share is then distributed along the height of a structure	train
audio_0_136548.wav	now, using equation fifteen, we have, we are assuming the current density	train

audio_0_130299.wav	So, answer would be fh=1	train
audio_0_118715.wav	Now, if you see, so this is the result corresponding to our three simulation, which we did	train
audio_0_3726.wav	So, move it like this thumb is the direction of the current, then you just grasp that your what you call the finger 1, this is the direction of the flux that is why this is shown here, that is why this is shown here right, and this N to S that flux line will be N to S	train
audio_0_111637.wav	So, alpha is 0 and gamma is j beta	train
audio_0_102291.wav	If you were to do the same experiment on a poly lysine coated surface you would not see it	train
audio_0_106314.wav	Here it's the same, here it's the same	train
audio_0_19711.wav	But for the purchase department, that is price variances, we take actual quantity	train
audio_0_108978.wav	So that situation is to be expected	train
audio_0_126000.wav	So, with this particular experiment, I hope that you understood something further regarding how to apply the operational amplifier for the application of a filter	train
audio_0_110165.wav	So, several iterations were carried out in the configuration of the brickwork and the type of masonry units and motor as well	train
audio_0_17841.wav	1 and in case of pessimistic into 1	train
audio_0_120199.wav	Even in a restaurant business, it was difficult to segregate, but in a business manufacturing chocolate, you could quite separate	train
audio_0_167651.wav	And therefore, I would strongly, strongly recommend that do not use reinterpret cast at all	train
audio_0_138345.wav	this is per unit on system base because g machine up on g system, so each system is equal to g machine	train
audio_0_154903.wav	Delta is 1 the sum of all individual loops gains	train

audio_0_114979.wav	So, now let us simplify this particular thing for small p input	train
audio_0_161189.wav	so y one minus y two now can be replace by another variable which is unrestricted	train
audio_0_168045.wav	And now you can understand the moment you make the destructor of the base class virtual, because otherwise this whole mechanism will not work, the whole cleanup consistency will not work	train
audio_0_159604.wav	that is the one, one of the reason why the word at optimum is being used in the dual interpretation	train
audio_0_133261.wav	Okay, so let us try to build this return to libc attack, so there are two things that we would require, we would require the address of where system resides in the entire process and we also need to find somewhere in the process the location of the string /bin/sh is present	train
audio_0_138478.wav	v n is equal to two, twenty upon root, three k v, because these two, twenty kilo volt line	train
audio_0_161226.wav	we try six comma zero and observe that six into three, eighteen is less than twenty one	train
audio_0_13450.wav	So, it will be minus V 2 either this way or this way	train
audio_0_156778.wav	Now if we have a load ZL for achieving gamma in and suppose our input is somewhere here then for achieving this we have to have something in between this load and the input which will create the gamma in equal to 0	train
audio_0_117846.wav	So, what you see over here that here is a signal is present over here and this is nothing, but a noise floor	train
audio_0_103172.wav	Why because, if this is your nucleus you are probing from the top	train
audio_0_138510.wav	if you take this one, it will be d b one, right d b one one into your d b one, two into d b one, three	train
audio_0_154461.wav	In the next module, we will discuss about noise figure circuits	train
audio_0_125324.wav	He is using the same multimeter, and when he is connecting with the probe, we can see the value of the capacitor which is around 464	train
audio_0_167372.wav	So, error handling or being able to debug the programs efficiently is a part and parcel of developers owns life, is a part and parcel of a program life cycle	train
audio_0_165869.wav	Let say different scenario, I have void f int, I have void f that is I have overloads of this and then I am calling f 3 or I am calling f, if I call f 3, I bind to this; if I call f, I bind to this	train
audio_0_115205.wav	So, even though you may say we had designed for 20 db this is 20	train
audio_0_135368.wav	we will find this kind of problem has been taken as an mathematical development	train
audio_0_18710.wav	One can know whether you are achieving or not achieving and that helps in prompt review process	train
audio_0_109587.wav	It's important to be able to write it in terms of that stress because we know that the brick unit will fail in tension	train
audio_0_10408.wav	So, it is the net change in the secondary terminal voltage from no load to full load expressed as a percentage of it is rated voltage so, this is my voltage regulation right	train
audio_0_2675.wav	So, we can use the Excel function also to get the same answer	train
audio_0_4466.wav	So, naturally that voltage will also induce in your what you call in the stator winding	train
audio_0_12589.wav	But, we assume that this capacitor initially was charge at v 0	train
audio_0_103961.wav	So, what you see is once you reach confluency, once you reach confluency these cells exhibit what is called as CAM and; that means that they migrate they migrate in tangential direction in the pattern	train
audio_0_21810.wav	Basically you can share your experience not only from SIBM, your entirely, from your entire learning experience you can tell us how you probably approach examinations	train
audio_0_122589.wav	So, you actually get your happiness at a lower price or sometimes airlines give a deal in consumption in the tourism board, that the, you will have to lower price if you travel on Thursday and do not return on Saturday, but you return on Sunday or you return on Monday	train
audio_0_110748.wav	So, now let us just take the special case when NF i is equal to NF min	train
audio_0_103226.wav	So, what you will have is a plot of time and area, A	train
audio_0_131913.wav	In this particular case it is no so we skip this steps and we go to this place then we perform a traditional page walk and page table, page walk using the page directories and page tables and therefore we will be able to convert the virtual address of that data to the corresponding physical address	train
audio_0_15683.wav	So, hope I have not missed any branch or anything hope everything is correct I believe right	train
audio_0_158485.wav	the penalty was the same as that in the last calculation	train
audio_0_2786.wav	So, this is the symbol for that	train
audio_0_129610.wav	Because it should not be like half of the substrate here and half the substrate here	train
audio_0_151679.wav	So, we have fx and cos nx dx, it is integrated, then the first one has become 0 because that is a0 by 2 integral minus pi to pi and then we have cos nx dx	train
audio_0_170578.wav	Sometimes they have the paper title right somewhere we can have the protein name work for here it match the protein name right	train
audio_0_102969.wav	So, suggesting that again demonstrating that cell plating density influences with MSC fate	train
audio_0_22383.wav	And can we mention that so and so paragraph, so and so line	train

audio_0_26840.wav	all right, And we have said again, just to refresh your memory, we are going to consider a system with N equal to 4 subcarriers and L equal to 2 tap ISI channel, L equal to 2 tap ISI channel	train
audio_0_124061.wav	So, let us not go into really detail because this just to give you a glimpse	train
audio_0_106521.wav	And the slenderness ratios go all the way from 6 to 27	train
audio_0_103626.wav	One was the dependence on concentration right	train

audio_0_132347.wav	In this lecture on the other hand we will be only focusing on the internals of ptmalloc2	train
audio_0_113763.wav	Now, you might feel, where is log coming into picture, log comes into picture if you take log on both the sides, so what will happen now, log of tau is equal to log of R n plus 1 minus log of R n	train
audio_0_23417.wav	Imagine a set of instructions are being passed to a set of people to perform a set of job and they complete that task and again submit it to that higher admin and that admin completes the entire project and submits to the super admin, so all these activities can be handled and probably managed to a device like this basically	train
audio_0_159714.wav	once again, we divide only with negative values	train
audio_0_122965.wav	And today I will introduce you to my third teaching assistant	train
audio_0_163611.wav	What does the combination of values in the data members decide the combination of values in the data member we have seen in the last module decide the state of the object	train
audio_0_155714.wav	So, since here the A3 reflected wave will be 0 and only B3 willÉ So, any single reaching port 3, once it encounters Z0, it will not be, no component of that B3 will be reflected back	train
audio_0_131684.wav	So, for example, over here in this case the attacker would need to know where the address of gadgets1, gadget2, gadget3 and gadget4 are present in the library	train
audio_0_119611.wav	So, here; obviously, we have to scrutinize each cost activity, manage each cost lower year after year; that means, it is not you cannot take a position today then say this is LC, but a Low Cost position, you have to understand that others are constantly trying to lower their cost	train
audio_0_128329.wav	nNow can you press another one, more time this is channel 2 right	train
audio_0_167264.wav	You need to that programming language to be aware of the memory or to be aware of the address where values get stored	train

audio_0_166827.wav	But, you will have to remember that d will disappear; have to disappear first as a destruction of d will happen earlier than the destruction of c	train
audio_0_108251.wav	So, in case the tension control criterion is not satisfied, when you then proceed to estimate A, if the under root is negative negative then there is a physical implication which has to be addressed which is lack of compression capacity which requires a change in the design strength or the cross section of the wall	train
audio_0_153698.wav	So we can see a shorted transmission line can take on both positive values as well as negative values for different values of d	train

audio_0_26367.wav	if you go back and look at H hat, for instance, you can see H hat is basically your H plus X bar, transpose X bar, V bar, which is a linear combination of Gaussian	train
audio_0_112539.wav	So, I just want to tell you in the s2p file the incorporate the biasing condition	train
audio_0_149062.wav	so, basically, persuade involves being able to convince the others to take appropriate action	train
audio_0_152553.wav	1 0	train
audio_0_170320.wav	But now, I can just use this observation to model not just the mobile phone and the landline phone separately, but I can model as mobile phone is a landline phone	train
audio_0_158533.wav	all three of them are centered around a principle: that when we make an allocation, we put as much as we can, which means we either consume all the supply or exhaust all the demand	train
audio_0_135358.wav	this is equation forty four	train
audio_0_100802.wav	But this is not foolproof because even within here you have cases where in case of this red trajectory this distance might be very good might be reasonably high compared to this case	train
audio_0_146474.wav	one can say that this is the foundation of all kinds of communication behavior	train
audio_0_137576.wav	p means iteration count	train
audio_0_108797.wav	So, the stress block is estimated as A and similarly the total calculation of the ultimate moment can be made where the difference will be the value of A being different now with respect to the previous calculation where we considered the contribution of the compression reinforcement	train
audio_0_100905.wav	So, this is your adherent zone and this is non adherent zone	train
audio_0_124477.wav	You can see that an engineer is loading the wafer	train
audio_0_132397.wav	So as we have seen before each thread arena can contain multiple heaps, so these heaps are linked together by linked list	train
audio_0_149507.wav	So, we have 1 by 4 then the right hand was this 8, then we have plus this x and minus this 2y and then we have set up these iterations, so the values are 0th level and the left hand side we have the values after first iteration	train
audio_0_104830.wav	So, it is affect start to manifest slightly later	train
audio_0_156350.wav	Power amplifiers on the other hand where signal purity is not so critical, we have a wide range of Classes from A to F	train
audio_0_117306.wav	So, now, I am going to show you the relation which is ABCD to S parameters	train
audio_0_15774.wav	So, direction of current and polarity of voltage must confirm with those shown in figure 1	train
audio_0_27543.wav	Now to get the time domain channel coefficients, what paved we have to do is we have to take the IFFT, similarly the N equal to 4, point IFFT, and then you get the corresponding estimates of the channel taps in the time domain	train
audio_0_119882.wav	So, this doubtful pay off must also be addressed in your service brand building approach and very important that take how to all possibilities unpleasantness	train
audio_0_173524.wav	So, we divide alignment process in to a smaller parts	train
audio_0_114564.wav	So, Z1 is the characteristic impedance of this particular line and we have taken these 2 equal because, we want equal power division	train
audio_0_122399.wav	So, 20 patients are in the queue waiting, but not waiting ideally they are getting treated, they are getting processed and then, even within the operation theater they had 3 beds	train
audio_0_162111.wav	The list starts with a colon ends with the beginning of the constructor body, and this is something which as no parallel for any other member functions	train
audio_0_120613.wav	Initially, this concept came about from industries like earth moving machinery in a excavation and various other kinds of construction machinery that are used, when you are creating a large plant or creating a large residential complex	train
audio_0_4890.wav	So, this is equation6right	train
audio_0_168763.wav	They can be used as we have seen to hide information about the implementation of a class while exposing the behavior through the interface and we have specifically seen that get set methods a specific idiom is often used in C++ to provide very fine grain control on the interface in terms of what access to the data members you want to provide in your design	train
audio_0_156980.wav	So let us try to look at that kind of a waveform which is corresponding to continuous conduction	train
audio_0_171083.wav	So, first we prepare the ligand and compare the ligand with the known actives and even we reduce the total number of ligands based on the physicochemical properties	train
audio_0_160570.wav	we would use this three supply, three demand problem as a numerical illustration to explain the algorithms and the methods	train
audio_0_12235.wav	TW stands for two winding	train
audio_0_111482.wav	Actually the reason is not that the switch was bad, the reason for that is we have used coupling capacitor as only a 100 Pico farad	train
audio_0_129010.wav	Hertz is nothing but frequency right	train
audio_0_113588.wav	So, Z in is given by Z 0 which is characteristic impedance of the line you can see here there is a load impedance and then Z 0 tan beta L beat is nothing but propagation constant	train
audio_0_120908.wav	So, now, that response, that need is felt in real time and response can be generated in real time	train
audio_0_106885.wav	That's a tricky issue and if you remember when I was talking about types of clay bricks we refer to fire clay, we referred to molded bricks and wire cut bricks	train
audio_0_158538.wav	so we end this discussion on graphical and algebraic with this question that: do we have a method that can do these three things	train
audio_0_107475.wav	So, the second module starts examining masonry, particularly its constituents and understands what properties of the constituents contribute to the overall strength and performance of masonry as a structural typology	train
audio_0_159232.wav	we also realize that is, in the next iteration this minus forty by itself was becoming feasible and therefore there was no need to do the dual simplex way	train
audio_0_166980.wav	So, you can clearly see that it is just a direct extension of the semantics of data members that we had or the semantics of layout that we had in case of the single inheritance	train
audio_0_158029.wav	So you don't even have to put the negative sign as long as you understand that the voltage is in the reverse polarity	train
audio_0_10867.wav	So, now I am going back to that problem, let me clean this	train
audio_0_161688.wav	so here i am going to write the left hand side of the first constraint	train
audio_0_126319.wav	What is burst noise	train
audio_0_13490.wav	That means any any angle theta can be written as e to the power j theta, right	train
audio_0_168187.wav	So, this will be the part 1 of this discussion	train
audio_0_16691.wav	So now, in that case if you look that power, this is at this is at double frequency right	train
audio_0_163389.wav	You would also find a very similar error message because this is a redefinition message	train
audio_0_123266.wav	We have seen in the last modules what is function generator, right	train
audio_0_110831.wav	If gain is more important choose a point which is closer to other and if noise figure is more important then choose a point closer to this particular gamma 0	train
audio_0_128084.wav	So, what do you think	train
audio_0_132100.wav	Note that, the main function we see over here there is no invocation of malicious function but what we will show is that we can trick this entire system into invoking the malicious function, let say this as follows	train
audio_0_149794.wav	So, we will also cover some portion for this evaluation of complex and integrals So, coming to the residue, so suppose this f z, a function which is analytic for all z except this z equal to z naught which is an isolated singular point of this function f z	train
audio_0_131912.wav	So, we have a memory access that is which is initiated we set the enclave access to zero we check whether it is an enclave mode	train
audio_0_16414.wav	So, I am moving it little bit slowly	train
audio_0_128635.wav	So, how do we technically try to null the output voltage Vo	train
audio_0_104185.wav	And it has also been described the stiffness regulates differentiation	train
audio_0_163626.wav	Now, let us pick up two implementations of a stack to specifically discuss and illustrate this principle of information hiding	train
audio_0_113844.wav	Then the question comes what should be the spacing between these wire grid arrangement	train
audio_0_124380.wav	What is the next step	train
audio_0_110912.wav	After that we looked at the expression for transducer power gain and we had seen this particular expression over here	train
audio_0_105231.wav	So, if you have an actin filament, this is an actin filament and you have monomers which get added to the front edge of the cell right	train
audio_0_19658.wav	Because we have made a budget at a particular level of activity	train
audio_0_149665.wav	And then e power minus s t and then we have dt which can be integrated so we have e power minus s t over minus s	train
audio_0_133324.wav	Therefore now things get much more worse because if we have multiple devices which are managed by a single server, there would be multiple such CRP tables that are required to be stored in the server database	train
audio_0_102249.wav	So, taken together what these results suggest is that you can have an effect in which ECM stiffness alone can drive tumor progression	train
audio_0_18103.wav	So, make the columns for A and B, compute the contribution, take the EPSC and try to compute the profit for both the sales mixes	train
audio_0_151302.wav	So, here, the scenario is different now	train
audio_0_110002.wav	They are at very different levels of demand	train
audio_0_26076.wav	These are denoted by X zero, capital X zero, capital X one, capital X two, capital X three	train
audio_0_110212.wav	If you have full support and loads coming at a certain eccentricity different from what the reaction eccentricities are at the base, you will have top eccentricity and bottom eccentricities that are different	train
audio_0_172316.wav	So, using the jackknife test or you can use any blind test set to see whether this can predict reliably the activity of any new compound right	train
audio_0_121389.wav	So, there is an increasing need and demand for personalization, portability, entertainment in your pocket, creating a whole new range of services as well as products	train
audio_0_28441.wav	N has to be a greater than or equal to 74 samples, which is again an interesting result	train
audio_0_120808.wav	Now, this becomes a composite service provided by the seller development agency and it is possible today to do it quite efficiently and effectively and at reasonable cost, because of the emergence of many different types of communication, technologies and facilities	train
audio_0_12774.wav	Now, now top figure this set figure is that switch S 2 is closed right	train
audio_0_165456.wav	And there are several functions as if here, three functions here which takes an int x a double and takes some dot dot dot and you are trying to resolve which particular function, which particular catch clause will be resolved	train
audio_0_165720.wav	We have printed so far is what you already know, but then now what you are trying to do is to assigns C1 into C2, that is, this is what for built in types	train
audio_0_117145.wav	And then we actually calculated abcd parameters for a few cases and these were series z impedance or shunt y admittance	train
audio_0_123382.wav	This circuit was there on the breadboard, where you have seen 220 k resistors connected to the inverting and non inverting terminal	train
audio_0_10835.wav	So, in this case just for your understanding again I will draw the, for the case c	train
audio_0_10454.wav	So, that is your what you have written here what we have written here right this is the equation	train
audio_0_17086.wav	So, tau is equal to C R Thevenin, you can easily compute, right	train
audio_0_154904.wav	So, if we have one loop, then we will have only one loop gain, if we have 2 loops, then we will have 2 loops games	train
audio_0_105275.wav	And what is typically done in case you want to have desirable properties, you want to tinker with some of these properties, what's normally done is cement is known to provide strength to motor	train
audio_0_124486.wav	As you can see here, there is a silicon rod through which you can push the wafer inside	train
audio_0_170776.wav	So, I put 2LZM in the search option right you can see the search option here right we have put the 2LZM here right and then if you click on this go right then you will get the first page with 2LZM	train
audio_0_108032.wav	Of course what we are actually assuming in this case is that as the wall deflects, you know for geometry as the wall deflects the there is axial shortening and that axial shortening is going to actually create a problem because you have large deflections the axle shortening is more and then the contact is going to be lost	train
audio_0_163827.wav	So, for that, I had to provide a overloading opera of operator greater than in the complex class, if you remove this you will find that this code will not compiled because the it will deduce T to be complex and then it will say that it requires a greater than operator which does not exist in the complex class	train
audio_0_159414.wav	so it will have the form u i plus v j less than or equal to c i j	train
audio_0_15274.wav	What you call E 1 and E 2 voltage basically you can say this is the ideal transformer in this voltage	train
audio_0_107693.wav	We started looking at this aspect of structural modeling and analysis and I was basically introducing to you the different approaches that are appropriate considering the specific lateral load mechanisms of resistance that load bearing masonry constructions typically have	train
audio_0_11999.wav	So anyway, will consider this half cycle only because these are same, same area; if you consider 0, if you if you consider 0 to T by 2 right, if divided by T by 2 or 0 to T divided by 2, in that both will be covered	train
audio_0_123038.wav	So, when you talk about band reject filter, right we were looking at the circuit and we were not able to see the signal in the oscilloscope right	train
audio_0_153470.wav	So we are moving from this point in this direction and that is the orientation of the curve	train
audio_0_114889.wav	And the mixer has a property that it actually generates sum and difference of these 2 frequencies, now of course, in majority of their receivers it is only the difference of these 2 frequencies which is considered	train
audio_0_3330.wav	So, it is not there say current is flowing say this is my I right	train
audio_0_128087.wav	So, we have to use this silicon and we had to do lithography to form your integrated circuit that is why mono and lithos; So, the monolithic ICs refer to a single stone or a single crystal	train
audio_0_104238.wav	So, this is for C2C12 cells which are muscle cell lines and this is your hMSCs	train
audio_0_24984.wav	Since we have considered Sam, let’s make it a happy face, right	train
audio_0_101492.wav	So, how would you do that and the way to do that is essentially cross linking	train
audio_0_135755.wav	this is equation fifty five, this one	train
audio_0_166868.wav	Then, using both these objects the lifetime continues	train
audio_0_127668.wav	But is it in phase or out of phase	train
audio_0_163315.wav	They do not actually need to because what distinguishes the first multiply which multiplies two matrices and gives through another square matrix from the second function which post multiplies a matrix with a column vector to give a column vector or the third one which pre multiplies a matrix with a row vector to give a row vector	train
audio_0_131760.wav	We will not go into the details about this but in operating systems there is a process called copy on write, where typically library codes are all shared between all processes in the system	train
audio_0_159703.wav	now c j minus z j are zero	train
audio_0_102228.wav	So, and what they showed, so just you have this malignant transformation, it was associated with increase in col 1, collagen one density and its cross linking	train
audio_0_133067.wav	So finally we have this text segment, which comprises of the local variables, so in the function main, the local variables are N and M, so this local variables are present in the stack, so besides these, the stack also contains various aspects of function invocation and parameters processing from one function to another	train
audio_0_103105.wav	Let us read it again protein can be unfolded only if, when I say protein can be unfolded I mean, that the unfolding signature is observed with the experiment	train
audio_0_158868.wav	so if we take a typical x i j, that x i j will appear in the i'h constraint here and in the j't constraint in this	train
audio_0_121926.wav	That is why; this is often not of as the positioning of your service in the mind of the customer is often used sentence	train
audio_0_131973.wav	So this attack was first conceived in 1996 by Boneh, Demillo and Lipton in a very popular attack on RSA	train
audio_0_157197.wav	You can't turn it off unless it is reverse biased	train
audio_0_142774.wav	i mean this equation we are rewriting	train
audio_0_138771.wav	remem[ber] note that that classroom we cannot do four in to four matrix inversion from y bus	train
audio_0_16509.wav	So, we will put Z bar a complex number is equal to you can write either V m by I m this one or is equal to you can write V m by root 2 divided by I m by root 2	train
audio_0_10502.wav	If you come to this circuit if you come to this circuit that your this voltage I told you, this voltage is your v	train
audio_0_170656.wav	Then we discussed about information theory is called GOR method right they use the information theory and the information at the central position as well as a window length of 17 residues left side 8 residues and right side 8 residues right and use the information right to predict the secondary structures	train
audio_0_101817.wav	So, this x maximum number of these cells, but able to transit and which was lowest in case of A549 cells	train
audio_0_18183.wav	So, it is necessary that we identify sunk costs and ignore them for decision making	train
audio_0_127567.wav	5 kilo hertz, you will see you will see suddenly that again the gain will be less	train
audio_0_116101.wav	So, this is the simple way you can make a compact thing	train
audio_0_158899.wav	we are unduly worried about the fact that this is negative because the duals can be unrestricted in sign	train
audio_0_156359.wav	Our I D will also provide an output which follows the input voltage	train
audio_0_133216.wav	So, as we know that the application would be stored in the flash and what could possibly happen is that an attacker could modify the flash contents and therefore could modify the secure components of that application the function maliciously	train
audio_0_124229.wav	Now, but when you talk about piezo resistive cantilevers (Refer Time: 48:53)it is micro because the size is microns	train
audio_0_132165.wav	So, note that the compiler has automatically changed a call, a function invocation to this, to a function, the function invocation at PLT	train
audio_0_2349.wav	So, then you prioritise the problems	train
audio_0_108122.wav	So let's just examine how that is arrived at	train
audio_0_102212.wav	The authors did not stop here; they extended it to in vivo and ask that can they observed similar observations in vivo using a mouse model	train
audio_0_171338.wav	Energy they calculate the van der Waals energy and the electrostatic energy like the ampere force field, then they give the total energy of this thing; this the energy using the glide	train
audio_0_111392.wav	So, depending on the output power level and hence the distance range to be covered the power supply requirements will change	train
audio_0_124631.wav	Let us quickly once again see ideally we know that input impedance of op amp is infinite right, then there is no current end entering in the input of the op amp, but in the real world some content does enter the inputs	train
audio_0_141366.wav	now, z per unity values can be determined from the equivalent impedance on primary or secondary side of a transformer	train
audio_0_101686.wav	PDMS is full form is poly dimethyl siloxane	train
audio_0_141191.wav	so, similarly for this, similarly under the total, under the flux, beyond the centre of conductor two does not link any any current	train
audio_0_146038.wav	so today we will be looking at the basic elements ah which constitute audience response and, ah before that, ah organizing the presentation voice and language, body language and gestures and visual presentation and we will be covering it in two sessions	train
audio_0_122500.wav	This is where we have most pure services, not having much of tangible goods associated	train
audio_0_163974.wav	So, this is how the object is getting constructed and just for reference, I have put the definition of the credit class and other classes here, this is just for your reference, but this is the output this the whole thing is output	train
audio_0_106737.wav	If you don't provide confinement to the masonry wall it is brittle under the action of lateral forces	train
audio_0_26222.wav	if you look at the variance now look at this	train
audio_0_130066.wav	So, because of this characteristics, it will help us to remove the loading effect and you will see loading effect in the experiments as well	train
audio_0_154800.wav	So then I hope this is visible	train
audio_0_135822.wav	so it is coming x a is equal to point six, four and the graph a is that your pre fault condition and voltage is given one point two and one	train
audio_0_104584.wav	So, the bacteria actually sends out some chemokines which are sensed by the neutrophil and the neutrophil moves in the direction of the chemical field	train
audio_0_10949.wav	So, numerator and denominator both side you divide by root over R square plus omega L square, R square plus omega L square is equal to v	train
audio_0_26775.wav	These are the N equal to 4 symbols loaded onto your, loaded onto the subcarriers	train
audio_0_113154.wav	So, this is 1 minus j b	train
audio_0_126628.wav	I want to have my sensing material, correct	train
audio_0_11237.wav	So, similarly V AN will be I a Z y is equal to V L upon root 3 angle minus 30 degree is equal to V p upon root 3 angle minus 30 degree	train
audio_0_110611.wav	ah Add sub circuit IF filter ok, I will add it to here; save it	train
audio_0_169546.wav	Which is not very common particularly to the C program	train
audio_0_11536.wav	So, minus j x minus j means it is angle minus 90 degree	train
audio_0_130759.wav	Because, it is often very difficult to judge like how many pushes or pops will be done and whether they are really balanced or not, because the last iteration of the push POP last iteration of loop normally it comes out without executing the body	train
audio_0_159518.wav	so this value is actually	train
audio_0_138603.wav	the reason is simple: uh, suppose this is your v a n, this is v a n, this is this was your line to line voltage	train
audio_0_114069.wav	So, this problem is given	train
audio_0_131992.wav	Now this AES implementation takes a plain text and the secret key and gives you a cipher text	train
audio_0_112477.wav	I will tell you	train
audio_0_116015.wav	Now, we have to define two different things here	train
audio_0_129933.wav	So, again Suman is going to help us	train
audio_0_3750.wav	So, it is the difference between these two head quantities which actually drives current through the resistance of the armature circuit we will see later	train
audio_0_143692.wav	similarly, another is the self reliance that is believing in yourself, and he say that it comes through practice and experience	train
audio_0_127516.wav	We cannot understand significant or we cannot deal any actually when the loading is there, when the loading is not there, which band is passing, which band is not passing that we cannot see because of the effect of the loading	train
audio_0_128114.wav	Why they are hitting with a wood	train
audio_0_153364.wav	So, having that knowledge we can say now we can conclude that 3 this is the Laplace transform of e power 3 by 2 t so 1 over s minus a the Laplace inverse it is e power a t	train
audio_0_103361.wav	So, you define stress normal stress sigma is given by F by A	train
audio_0_100600.wav	So, what the authors found is as follows	train
audio_0_10237.wav	Current flowing through this is I c and through this branch is I m	train
audio_0_20630.wav	Similarities void coefficient of reactivity should also be negative	train
audio_0_113337.wav	So, from here all the power will go to this particular load impedance which is not 50 Ohm, yet because of this matching technique, we have transferring of course, as I mentioned earlier inductors and capacitors are not going to be ideal but I did mention that these inductors and capacitors have generally low losses or at least chose inductor and capacitor which have a low loss values	train
audio_0_26832.wav	you basically have the received samples	train
audio_0_3083.wav	Now look into that that your what you call your 1 2 suppose R 1, R 2, R 3 and here it is your Rb, Rc, Ra right	train
audio_0_116471.wav	And, we can actually find out the total pattern by multiplying the slot pattern with the array factor, rectangular microstrip antenna can also be modeled as a transmission line	train
audio_0_168579.wav	So, objects are basically instances of a class; so given one class, I can have multiple instances of that class a class tells us the blue print, tells us the format in which the data and the method should be organised for an object And every object will have a separate identity; it will have its own values of the data members that will specify the state in which the object will reside	train
audio_0_147342.wav	and empathy: these kind of people have lots of empathy for others	train
audio_0_137345.wav	so this generalized formula you try to understand again and again	train
audio_0_3566.wav	So description of the parts of a DC machine, so figure 5 actually shows the sectional view of four pole DC machine, first one is the frame I will show you in the diagram	train
audio_0_119755.wav	So, in these cases the trade offs are often laden with latent needs, not articulated needs	train
audio_0_170146.wav	Now to the last part	train
audio_0_110312.wav	In fact, many a times you can just think about it that if this is I 2 which is coming in just think about this is current let us say I 2 dash and which is leaving here, then I 2 dash will be nothing but minus I 2 and that will be here then plus I 2 dash, ok	train
audio_0_124242.wav	Again if you understand the process of this particular cantilever then you will be able to understand MOSFETs as well	train
audio_0_154780.wav	Now the first problem is that, if suppose there is an incident wave a1 entering the first section then it will be reflected from this junction	train
audio_0_165002.wav	So, I have a very simple situation	train
audio_0_19036.wav	The decision making part says that which product line should be focused if total sales can be increased by 20% for any one of the products	train
audio_0_18146.wav	Of course I have said normally or usually it may not be every time	train
audio_0_10766.wav	So, now, this current source so, it is actually supplying power because it is leaving this terminal	train
audio_0_151399.wav	And on the other hand, if you what to express for example this f x in sine series, so if you want to express now in sine series, then we have to extend this function as an odd function in the interval minus L to 0, so that in the whole interval minus L to L the function becomes an odd function	train
audio_0_105833.wav	However, since IS 18992 talks about earthquake resistance, minimum earthquake resistance that buildings must have, 4326 and 1905 have to be looked at together	train
audio_0_12442.wav	So, let me clear it; So, that is that is why this is we have got that 4 volt right, here it is here it is 4 volt right V L is equal to so, next one varieties of problem we have taken	train

audio_0_163764.wav	So, basically once we instantiated int and double actually what I get, when I execute are two overloaded functions both of which are called max both of which takes two parameters and written one value and all of these for a for a one particular function is have the same types	train
audio_0_118083.wav	You actually draw a line like this and measure this particular angle and that will give the angle of the reflection coefficient	train
audio_0_23880.wav	Because probably the teacher would only explain it once for the entire class and no individual attention is given for one particular student	train
audio_0_107464.wav	Now if you were to examine the percentages, out of 100% of these, if you add up the percentages of unburnt brick, stone and burnt brick for the 2001 census, we get a total of 84	train
audio_0_151611.wav	Again similarly, at the point 2, we have from the left hand it is 1 minus 2 square so that it is 1 minus 4 which is minus 3, and when we take this limit from the right hand side, this is just 2, a constant	train
audio_0_17032.wav	Now, the Thevenin resistance at the capacitor terminals are now here to find out the transient response; you have to find out that R Thevenin right	train
audio_0_115715.wav	So, we know how to find out the radiation pattern of a linear array you can see that there are M elements	train
audio_0_128856.wav	So, once you know that this is heat sink what is the use of heat sink right, but if you do not know what is this thing then it is very difficult to ask	train
audio_0_154487.wav	Now if we plot these curves these noise figure circles then we go to the slides on the monitor, these are the circles this the gamma S plain and we know that gamma S plain is related to the available power of gain	train
audio_0_125768.wav	I have V G S 4 volts, V T I do find it out	train
audio_0_117489.wav	Now, one may say that why the AC load line and DC load lines are different	train
audio_0_163575.wav	That it as to refer to the specific data member of the class and it as allowed to do so	train
audio_0_122768.wav	So, we map we create understand the fail points, we understand by a bottleneck points, we set up standard, so that of there is no failure, service failure	train
audio_0_116549.wav	So, that is the reason majority of the time people say bandwidth of the microstrip antenna is relatively small	train
audio_0_169913.wav	Let us a move the encapsulation back, now these all have become private	train
audio_0_150146.wav	Because after taking the Laplace transform, the new series may not be convergent series so we have to again discuss the convergence issues and so it is in general, not possible to take the Laplace term by term	train
audio_0_123052.wav	and y You see that slowly when we increase the frequency, I see 139 Hertz, stop it here 150 Hertz and for 150 Hertz, what is output voltage output voltage	train
audio_0_15258.wav	So, A is equal to phi m by B max	train
audio_0_116588.wav	And, then you can see another loop here this loop corresponds to the length L 2, which is happening at a higher frequency	train
audio_0_3633.wav	Therefore graphite and carbon graphite brushes are self lubricating and widely used	train
audio_0_103048.wav	So, this is one such representative data point you have to do it multiple numbers of times and need to determine the statistics	train
audio_0_12876.wav	For example if it is a later we will see that where will consider that your numericals for your containing your considering your different type of dependent sources voltage or current	train
audio_0_123793.wav	So, you cannot connect like what we have seen in the ideal op amp	train
audio_0_12909.wav	And after that you connect that circuit has the, whatever way it is given same thing	train
audio_0_153785.wav	In the same way that we obtained the curve from Z value, we should also be able to get the curve, Smith chart form the Y values and such a Smith chart is called as Y Smith chart	train
audio_0_172188.wav	So, it uses the greedy incremental algorithm to select the protein sequence sets	train
audio_0_166378.wav	So, not at being at this pointer has a consequence that the static member function cannot access anyone of them	train
audio_0_151806.wav	And now we want to see this range what is for x we are varying from 0 to this square root t this graph and then for t it is going from 0 to infinity	train
audio_0_169718.wav	This is the process stages that happen	train
audio_0_22642.wav	Essentially we do not want to	train
audio_0_157198.wav	When it is reverse biased and the current goes to zero it will automatically go off	train
audio_0_159371.wav	now we realize that this region is unbounded in the sense that there is, there is no finite region that we have	train
audio_0_126228.wav	Then you have to retrieve this signal from the noise right that means, you have to filter out this noise and retrieve only the signal, so that you can hear it clearly all right	train
audio_0_119261.wav	Suppose you are a very well established restaurant chain offering western food and now, you want to get in to Chinese you want to open specialized Chinese restaurants	train
audio_0_170389.wav	So, if we take the entropy based method; so c is score 1 * ln = 0 if you take the position number 6 right the equation is f * ln f right, i varies from i = 1 to 20	train
audio_0_4711.wav	So, real part is here and imaginary part is here right	train
audio_0_154521.wav	Now depending upon what kind of relationship I have between this Z and this is my small Z	train
audio_0_150793.wav	So s over s square plus 1 and then the Laplace transform of g t where we can apply this first shifting theorem which says e power this minus pi by 3 s will go out and then the Fourier transform or the Laplace transform of f t that is just the cos t so the Laplace transform is s over s square plus 1	train
audio_0_136871.wav	now, suppose we want to find out what will be the maximum value of your delta c, that is the critical clearing angle	train
audio_0_122245.wav	Because, you can ask your bank balance even at mid night which normally you would not had been possible in the human service environment	train
audio_0_119806.wav	We discussed the different constructs relating to services quality and we ended the last session by introducing the concept of service recovery	train
audio_0_106373.wav	So the shear wall, the capacity of the shear wall to resist lateral forces can be enhanced if you can account for these flanges	train
audio_0_3598.wav	So, next is the armature, the armature consists of core and winding	train
audio_0_132058.wav	You can delete node and you can actually print all the elements in the list	train
audio_0_101841.wav	So, the ones at the bottom, so they checked; so you have the top cells and the bottom cells and then the check what is the circularity of the cells at the top and the bottom and they found, but the cells which were at the bottom also expressed lesser amount of lamin A ratio was less compared to those at the top ok	train
audio_0_135581.wav	so as a check, equivalent inertia relative to a hundred m v a base, that total kinetic energy was this one: five four four zero	train
audio_0_121721.wav	But, even there you know people will not tolerate low quality for long	train
audio_0_156928.wav	So let us now try to take a look at now that we have seen at least half wave rectifier, let us now go to the full bridge controlled rectifier	train
audio_0_17458.wav	And mind well, sometimes students are so intelligent that they come out with two, three, four PVRs because it is asked in the problem	train
audio_0_122220.wav	So, a point can be made here that is SST or Self Service Technology systems can be what we call fixed response systems or program response system	train
audio_0_110891.wav	So, one may have to use cascaded stages of these low noise amplifier	train
audio_0_113263.wav	Now, we move along the constant r circle, it is very very important you move along constant r circle	train
audio_0_162393.wav	And in those cases, and which are quite a few, you may need to make use of the explicit conversion	train
audio_0_131088.wav	This variation in execution time was used to actually transfer information from one process to another	train
audio_0_27953.wav	alright, So basically what weíre doing in this module is weíre using this equalizer, that is, the least squares equalizer, that is, c bar, which we have estimated as umm, which, for which we have derived the expression previously, that is, c bar equals H, H umm transpose inverse times H into 1 bar 2	train
audio_0_17109.wav	So, next one is next one is ah this is ah this is very interesting problem	train
audio_0_157453.wav	Once you have come down to 90, you don't have any more margin left	train
audio_0_117477.wav	So, the conduction angle is maximum for class A amplifier and it is minimum for class C amplifier, for class A amplifier it is around 360 degree and for class C it is of the order of 10 degree or 20 degree depending upon the situation how high pulse or for how much duration you are interested in the pulse that is to be generated by class C amplifier	train
audio_0_102934.wav	In addition, the way the stem cell hierarchy was initially imaged in people would always think that from this stem cell you give rise you have these cycles, this guy can self renew or differentiate	train
audio_0_121948.wav	This is actually when the customer has felt the need and customer has spend the time or references to find that which service you assured like to use	train
audio_0_21495.wav	Thank you Sir	train
audio_0_168777.wav	This is the outline of what I intend to discuss at the first level of inheritance in C++	train
audio_0_10726.wav	So, p 4 will be 3 into 5 that is 15 watt power absorbed	train
audio_0_120562.wav	But, today the situation is different, as I will show you, services today dominant the GDP, the economic structure of most developed economies and even many emerging economies	train
audio_0_170951.wav	Rigid and flexible	train
audio_0_128026.wav	But this is just a crude way of understanding	train
audio_0_11594.wav	7 that is your 71 angle 0 degree right	train
audio_0_27231.wav	and remember, when N is greater than or equal to M, our matrix X is N x M and this matrix is basically also known as a thin matrix	train
audio_0_141737.wav	this is, this is a receiving end power means output and sending end power means input, so eighty up on eighty five point five, eight in to hundred, so ninety three point four, seven percent	train
audio_0_131829.wav	So now that we know how a library can be made relocatable either using the PIC technique or by Load time relocatable	train
audio_0_127095.wav	That means, that we can realistically assume that the voltage at the non inverting terminal of the operational amplifier is equal to the voltage at the inverting terminal	train
audio_0_167619.wav	The next is what is known as reinterpret cast operator, the third kind of	train

audio_0_146685.wav	who will overcome the limited, limited information	train
audio_0_102775.wav	So, you want to for protein unfolding studies, you want to operate at sparse concentrations	train
audio_0_167035.wav	Now in this if I also want, there is a situation that in some case I want to actually also access the f function of base 2 then like I did in case of data members I can explicitly write c dot base 2 colon colon f 3 in which case it will actually call f member function of the base two class	train
audio_0_146476.wav	before we try to communicate or give training to others how they should communicate, we have to understand whether communication with ourselves is very effective	train
audio_0_122400.wav	So, one bed was for the person now almost fully prepared	train
audio_0_158940.wav	from the solution u one is twenty one, u two is twenty four implies x one and x two are non basic	train
audio_0_164007.wav	Similarly, the next one will take C 2 and copy construct to find of to construct C 3 as copies of these	train
audio_0_13899.wav	So, actual polarity this is plus this is minus , right	train
audio_0_109139.wav	The second mechanism of shear failure is what we have seen earlier, the shear sliding failure, which is expected to occur at a bed joint	train
audio_0_108857.wav	Now those could be concrete hollow blocks or it could be the perforated clay brick blocks with steel reinforcement and grouting	train
audio_0_109841.wav	On the other side of the unit you have the increased pre compression sigma B, the difference being delta sigma y in the two cases	train
audio_0_1950.wav	In fact, we have used this error in obtaining homography matrix, fundamental matrix or projection matrix in previous computational problems	train
audio_0_170912.wav	So, how we get the conclusion that you can get the structure from this sequence; because if you have the sequence the residues are accommodated in different specific range right also you can see the specific combination of this amino acid residues	train
audio_0_165507.wav	And only after that the stack frame will be squashed and the control will go back to g	train
audio_0_100706.wav	So, this part of integrins also part of the focal adhesions the linked to the active network, and eventually through intermediate cytoskeletal intermediate filament networks they are connected to the nucleus nuclear membrane and that will eventually link it to the DNA	train
audio_0_14544.wav	So, if; that means, these are the data given	train
audio_0_119677.wav	So, next two sessions will be on pricing	train
audio_0_13667.wav	So, this way it has been done	train
audio_0_125537.wav	aApply a sine viewwave input of 5 volts, 5 5 kilo hertz, voltage from generator at V 1	train
audio_0_142731.wav	so, generally, as you know from your this thing, that line admittance, actually for line i two k, bus i two k, small y i this is like the small y i k is equal to one up on z i k, right, this small z i k is equal to one up on r i z i k is equal to r i k plus j x i k	train
audio_0_13332.wav	Now if you take the voltage wave from I mean and current waveform suppose current when current posi[tion] your O A current position was at A and voltage at V and this phi and they are moving your at your what you call in anticlockwise direction, and omega is given that your what you call that as frequency, right	train
audio_0_121921.wav	So, this arena is that is the difference between your cost customers cost and the value to the customer is the further understood in terms of this dual pressure; that is there on pricing of services	train
audio_0_154417.wav	This has available gain value GA2 and noise figure F2	train
audio_0_122623.wav	Is it a corporate credit and so on	train
audio_0_11834.wav	It will B l v sin theta, right	train
audio_0_151695.wav	We will multiply by sin nx instead of cos nx, by doing so what we can get, we can get bn with the similar same argument which is done earlier	train
audio_0_138655.wav	therefore you can write: v a is equal to z s i a plus z m i b plus z m i c, because mutual inductance is given between the phases	train
audio_0_154475.wav	The input referred noise voltage and the input referred noise current so this is port 1 and this is port 2	train
audio_0_13785.wav	16 plus j, this is Admittance unit is more right	train
audio_0_164651.wav	And that is the reason you need to give it the address	train
audio_0_161740.wav	so there is something called keep, the solver solution, which you can do	train
audio_0_136130.wav	and whenever transformer is given thirty is here, it is given ah, where transformer one, twelve point two, one thirty two k v, that is, this is the low voltage side, this side, and when you going to generator	train
audio_0_136463.wav	there are some more factors later you will see	train
audio_0_123183.wav	Now we also know that recently when we talk about op amps, it has billions of transistors, but all are MOSFETs, right	train
audio_0_110384.wav	So, V 1 is nothing but A V 2	train
audio_0_131557.wav	To understand what is the implication of this change we look at the disassembly of main ok the actual return address is 08048454 and what we have actually changed this to, is 08048454C and essentially what it is doing is that it is actually skipping this add instruction and landing somewhere here	train
audio_0_3498.wav	So, at that time it will be like this right and again when it will go to another 180 degree then the your let me clear it	train
audio_0_151475.wav	So, if we write its cosine series with the similar steps, we have to follow what we have done before	train
audio_0_116432.wav	So, just recall now I showed you there is a microstrip patch, which is on top of the ground plane	train
audio_0_166957.wav	So, inheritance will mean that all properties and operations of each one of the base class will be inherited and they can be suitably overloaded or overridden	train
audio_0_20155.wav	Therefore, genetic disorder even in case of single gene disorder, we can have transmission to the next generation even have even as next generation can get directly affected as well	train
audio_0_12791.wav	Also, if you apply here at this point, if you apply at this point your at this point your KCL, you apply at this node right, then you will get your i 1 0 plus is equal to i c 0 plus plus i 2 0 plus right, so that means I am writing here i 1 0 plus is equal to your i c 0 plus right plus i 2 0 plus right, you apply KCL at this point	train
audio_0_165872.wav	So here at the compilation time at the program writing time itself I know what the binding will be, and therefore, this is also called early binding	train
audio_0_164760.wav	Now, when we try to invoke this function what will happen we are here	train
audio_0_124940.wav	Calculate the gain observed in the table and compare it with the theoretical gain	train
audio_0_25045.wav	So I have 1 over 4, 1 plus j plus 1 minus j plus 1 plus 2 j plus 2 minus j, which is equal to 1 plus 4, into 5 plus J, which is equal to 5 by 4 plus 1 over 4 plus times j	train
audio_0_159417.wav	so let us look at this example, which is a four by four example	train
audio_0_155571.wav	And the principal for balanced filter is exactly the same as that for a balanced amplifier, that is at port 2, the reflected wave add constructively add at port 1, the reflected wave add destructively as a result, even though our filter is fundamentally not matched for the low frequency signal, at the input port, we willnot see any reflected signals	train
audio_0_170661.wav	Later on then we discuss about the machine learning techniques, they used all the information right and they train this information using machine learning techniques like neural networks or support vector machines or different methods right and you predict the secondary structure	train
audio_0_138635.wav	so this is your zero sequence network diagram for this kind of connection and another last one for this one	train
audio_0_2984.wav	So, these two this two I did not give here intentionally I did not give here the mathematics 1 or 2 equation, I suggest this is a small exercise for you right	train
audio_0_4842.wav	So, it will be your XL minus XC may be R or XC minus your what you callanother thing will be XC minus your XL may be at two condition may happen right	train
audio_0_18198.wav	Now let us look at one or two more scenarios that is make or buy	train
audio_0_164087.wav	It does the operation of finding if something is an operand which is done at this point, if you just look at particularly focused at this point	train
audio_0_167052.wav	This is the basic dynamics of the construction process	train
audio_0_22329.wav	So teacher sharing the notes with the peers would usually take less time in case everyone is taking the notes while teacher is teaching in class	train
audio_0_142666.wav	so basically, four quantities are associated with each bus, right	train
audio_0_24494.wav	I am fine, the things are going, ok	train
audio_0_149787.wav	The Bessel's function we have discuss and we have computed its Laplace transform for the case when J is 0 and 1	train
audio_0_118060.wav	5 and these are the constant x as you can see here or here	train
audio_0_21079.wav	So, different isotopes of the same element, can have different number of neutrons, and accordingly their nuclear characteristics can be completely different; like, we shall be seeing later on, while the difference between U 235 and U 238 is only the presence of 3 extra neutrons in the nucleus for U 238; their nuclear nature is completely different	train
audio_0_120227.wav	To create our understanding of this whole structure of consumer, service consumer decision making and the process of evaluation of services, so fundamentally we have four blocks	train
audio_0_127417.wav	You will pass above and below a range of frequency whose cutoff frequencies are predetermined depending on the value of components in the circuit design	train
audio_0_167858.wav	Suppose, the value of the variable was 5 you read it once then you need not make an assignment, but you read it after may be ten statements or after it certain time the value may be found to be 7	train
audio_0_150822.wav	So, again here, because this e power minus s or minus 2s or minus 3s appears in the multiplication, so we will just get the Laplace inverse in this first case, 1 over s square plus 4 here we will get 1 over s square plus 4	train
audio_0_145157.wav	if you do not, if you fail to successfully execute any of the roles, that will also lead to stress	train
audio_0_10176.wav	R L and your what you call and a capacitive reactance X C right	train
audio_0_13707.wav	8 power factor lagging, when it said that lagging; that means, current actually lagging from the Voltage whenever gives that power fact that 0	train
audio_0_164950.wav	Now, let us see how casting will look like if you try to do it on a hierarchy	train
audio_0_142754.wav	and similarly, here it is also point four, j point four	train
audio_0_16829.wav	So, this is actually you have to find out for this circuit, you have to find out that you are in your in this figure, you have to find out that your V C t, ah	train
audio_0_10279.wav	Now, input power is input that low voltage side V 1 current is I 1 cos phi 1	train

audio_0_167246.wav	Now the interesting thing is that C data possibly is 1 byte here, which means that it can contain up to 255 the value incidentally that you have given to the 4 bytes of int happens to be less than 255	train
audio_0_132948.wav	So, as we know this program over here defines a string called which is initialised to hello world, and then invokes the printf function to print that particular string	train
audio_0_169482.wav	And, in the second part we have talked about different derived types, arrays, structure, union and pointer	train
audio_0_138046.wav	next is to calculate the inductance of a conductor	train
audio_0_19680.wav	as we know the material cost is units of consumption into the price, input prices	train
audio_0_166906.wav	Please, go through this carefully couple of times because construction, destruction and associated object lifetime is all of the very, one of the core concept of object management in C++	train
audio_0_103609.wav	This suggests that beyond a certain strain your network is starting to fall apart as a consequence of which your G prime value is decreasing, and the material is getting more and more viscous because of which G double prime is increasing	train
audio_0_110910.wav	And then applied the masons signal flow transfer function formula and after that we calculated path from point b s to b 2 and then we found out what are the different loops and then we found out overall b t2 by b s	train
audio_0_136980.wav	then when fault, look fault location and f away from the sending end, i told you that transfer reactance will increase	train
audio_0_12848.wav	This is the current source i; this i L and your what you call this i L and this i L both have to be same for equivalent	train
audio_0_165642.wav	You can convince yourself as to why this copy construction happens	train
audio_0_18807.wav	In last two sessions, in last two sessions we have been discussing about budgets	train
audio_0_14574.wav	So, you will get, you will get your what you call that your 235 upon 250 minus 0	train
audio_0_107049.wav	So, we are looking at a situation where the eccentricity of the axial force is less than t by 6, the classical expressions that we have seen earlier	train
audio_0_138131.wav	therefore the resultant air gap flux would be zero and there is no reactance due to armature reaction	train
audio_0_155643.wav	Then a composite filter will have characteristics something like between this	train
audio_0_148727.wav	we can always say that at least we are able to identify that this person is dead	train
audio_0_10980.wav	In this case, what is happening that two thing that this is we choose actually, we took i is equal to i m sin omega t right, that we took	train
audio_0_14897.wav	So, this side your, what you call 1000 turn, this is 1000 turn and excited by 1 ampere current right	train
audio_0_113832.wav	So, corner reflector antenna is defined by its angle alpha between the two metallic plates over here	train
audio_0_14248.wav	If the switch is closed for long time means, this switch was closed for long time right and that t your what you call t is equal to 0, the switch is just opened otherwise it was close	train
audio_0_117374.wav	So, let us look at the direct solution which is the another approach	train
audio_0_121446.wav	Of course, as the strategy rolls out you have to constantly evaluate performances, monitor the situation	train
audio_0_113030.wav	So, in a reality if you put only one what the circuit will see a chip capacitor in series with the inductor from here to the ground	train
audio_0_113715.wav	Now, what I have shown you here, these are the values given conventionally in the books	train
audio_0_110966.wav	The denominator goes over here, so, which is right over here	train
audio_0_17774.wav	Now the sales, it is directly given 5 887 so you get operating profit as 822 other income 104 so PBI is PBI is 926	train
audio_0_164634.wav	The comparison function is not necessary to be provided and if you do not provide that, then by default the sorting happens in the ascending order	train
audio_0_152136.wav	So, just to recall what we have learned in previous lecture, that was the Cauchy Riemann equations, that is CR equations, the necessary conditions for analyticity or differentiability that was already discussed	train
audio_0_162699.wav	And B adds u, v, and w, so does C, so does D, and these data members are also of private, protected and public kind	train

audio_0_149785.wav	So, these are the references we have use for preparing this lecture	train
audio_0_13931.wav	It will move move clock wise, then accordingly first word that minus 10 volt your encountering in this, right minus 10 volt	train
audio_0_13121.wav	Then equation 36; that means, this equation, if t is equals your here it is if t 0 is equal to 0, here it is t 0 is equal to 0	train
audio_0_109948.wav	Earlier we had looked at in the manual criteria, the second criterion was when the tensile strength of the unit was reached but now we are not going to be examining it in terms of the unit or the motor, you are going to be looking at tensile strength of masonry	train
audio_0_102303.wav	Size and force, and intensity and force which means that given if a focal adhesion is bigger there is increased amount of local localization of that protein at this adhesion	train
audio_0_164623.wav	It is pretty much like a normal comparison function and that function pointer; function name will be passed as a third parameter	train
audio_0_3737.wav	So, that means, that is that means, if you look into that this is the plus direction and this is the minus, and this is my back emf E b right	train
audio_0_104657.wav	So, if you draw of cell with the focal adhesion, for an adherent and cell, you would draw it typically by depicting these adhesions like these dots	train
audio_0_11822.wav	Then, this angle is also theta and this is 90 degree	train
audio_0_112245.wav	So, I will not talk more in detail about these things	train
audio_0_14549.wav	So, from which if you solve, you will get R is equal to 7	train
audio_0_106699.wav	The hollow block construction is not necessarily the only possibility that you have	train
audio_0_170733.wav	Then we have also NMR spectroscopy and microscopy are used to determine the structures	train
audio_0_171096.wav	For example, in this program Qikprop; we calculate more than 80 physicochemical properties	train
audio_0_4934.wav	If you look into the circuit, if you look into the circuit right is your what we call that your V ab is equal to this one, just let me go up that here it is V ab V small ab is equal to V capital AB	train
audio_0_104870.wav	So, what will drive is this so, when you detach the force balance is perturbed as the consequence of with this myotube will relax	train
audio_0_123943.wav	So, I hope that if you go through the entire series of lectures for this particular course, for this particular theory class then you will know how the how the things works particularly in the area of operational amplifiers	train
audio_0_15224.wav	So, it is coming 750 rpm because f is 50 hertz slip that is the torque for which the slip your what you call slip for which torque is maximum, so S max T is equal to n S minus n upon n S	train
audio_0_4281.wav	So, just to whateveRLittle bit you have studied we will come to phasor diagram other thing later you take a small example	train
audio_0_25332.wav	And of course now we have considered a simple channel with L equal to 2 taps	train
audio_0_104201.wav	On the intermediate surface, the cells looked more like that of muscle, from 12 kPa, the cells looked more like this	train
audio_0_22283.wav	So, what is the connection between design thinking and the four noble truths of Buddha	train
audio_0_152594.wav	Okay, so having that we have the flux of a vector field F through a surface S which we will discuss here in this lecture	train
audio_0_27294.wav	Received symbols are small ys in the time domain	train
audio_0_133845.wav	Now since we reset the power at the end of the epoch the counter would reset and start counting gain to zero	train
audio_0_26578.wav	Summation K equals 1 V square K is basically nothing but V bar transpose times V bar and it is also basically norm V bar square, Where norm V bar is the norm of the vector, of the Euclidean norm of the vector	train
audio_0_128133.wav	Let us see once again, it can be made identical with high reliability	train
audio_0_118343.wav	We have an RF signal applied at the gate, LO signal applied at the source terminal, and the output is taken at the drain	train
audio_0_159098.wav	we also calculate the c j minus z j to begin with, with x four, x five and x six, there are three constraints	train
audio_0_164134.wav	I have this function written outside of this class which is trying to do something with the class	train
audio_0_168950.wav	So, it is usually good to provide a constructor even if it does not have a parameter because once you provide a constructor, even if it is default, your constructor will be used and compiler will not provide the free constructor because if you write the default constructor or if you write any other overloaded constructor then you really know what are you are initializing	train
audio_0_138556.wav	the next one is that find out the capacitance of the line as shown in figure fifteen	train
audio_0_123777.wav	Differential voltage gain or voltage gain in finite, second bandwidth product bandwidth products in finite, input resistance in finite, output resistance zero right, this is what we have seen	train
audio_0_164752.wav	So, these cases are over	train
audio_0_119296.wav	And to maintain that difference to maintain that margin of the net market contribution as we take about you need to have operational excellence to manage this downward slope of the cost curve	train
audio_0_15714.wav	If it is like if it is given like this; that means, point 1 that is a plus terminal point 1 is 10 volt above point 2	train
audio_0_25711.wav	Therefore, the joint probability density function, that is, if I look at the joint PDF, that is F, of Y1, Y2… Up to YN, of Y1, Y2, that is, your Y2 up to YN, what is this	train
audio_0_115226.wav	So, what is a strip line as I had mentioned when I talked about transmission line a micro strip line requires only one substrate	train
audio_0_155016.wav	Lot of fringing field will be produced and the quality of the short degrades as frequency increases	train
audio_0_100169.wav	Use when you have no data about similar past projects	train
audio_0_16379.wav	So in fact, this is the true because there is no path for charge to leave the upper part of the circuit	train
audio_0_100714.wav	And through the dystroglycan complex, there is this protein called dystrophin which is the biggest protein in humans, which links the distroph glycan complex to the optimizing cytoskeleton	train
audio_0_136346.wav	that means that means we got voltage equation for bus i in terms of power injection, p i and your q i	train
audio_0_109434.wav	We need to estimate the second moment of area and the second moment of area is estimated considering the geometry of these two strips that are sitting about the center line of the wall itself	train
audio_0_23643.wav	There is nothing wrong with your current way, just saying that there is a better way, why do not you go online on NPTEL and listen to my course, it’s on Design Thinking	train
audio_0_151116.wav	So, the rate of change of f in the direction of a unit vector b is given by this directional derivative that is precisely how we define this directional derivative	train
audio_0_4777.wav	So, we are putting it I max by root 2 square into r right	train
audio_0_169808.wav	But the second parameter has not been provided, so the system will understand that you are using the default value of the second parameter, that is the second parameter will be taken to be 20 because a default value is given in the second parameter is 20	train
audio_0_155426.wav	This blue circle is the, is our Smith chart and this red circle are the operating power circles	train
audio_0_111217.wav	So, here you can see along this axis the usage from 0 to 10000 hour and this is the odd ratio of getting malignant brain tumor I have actually put a line somewhere over here and the reason for that is this corresponds to about 95000 hours	train
audio_0_109335.wav	So, it completely neglects the possibility of redistribution of stresses	train
audio_0_27833.wav	So let me also mention that, corresponding pilot symbols and naturally, it goes without saying, also the corresponding observations, because the observations are also have to be used to compute the estimate	train
audio_0_163265.wav	And, function overloading is another feature which allows us to write multiple functions with the same function name, as long as their parameter types differ	train
audio_0_163948.wav	Now, it is kind of a one function destructor function calling the next and once that completes then it calls the next destructor function and so on and when all these are over then the destruction process is over	train
audio_0_122544.wav	So, as I discuss a little bit more and show you some example, this will become clear	train
audio_0_12872.wav	Just we will go through step by step everything is written here, but I explain that how that electrical equivalent that i is equal to v v upon R or v is equal to i R	train
audio_0_156603.wav	So coming back to our written slides, so then that you see that this when the argument of this Chebyshev polynomials is between minus one if we, when the argument of this Chebyshev polynomial us between minus one and plus one, the output is also between minus one and plus one	train
audio_0_135900.wav	and delta m is equal to delta max, we got one, thirty two point seven degree	train
audio_0_167.wav	So color images they have only three components	train
audio_0_126640.wav	Now after loading the mask what I will do	train
audio_0_172004.wav	So, if you want to edit your data, you can directly go to edit and change modify and can save this data, but which should be avoided because this will modify original file itself	train
audio_0_17050.wav	So, using the relationship, you have ah you have to it is written that if that is asked to derive this right	train
audio_0_170899.wav	Even that fails then you go with the ab initio modelling we start from scratch and then try to get the 3 D structures the performance and the accuracy depends on various factors for example, if you have highly homologous structures then will get you can try to achieve the highest accuracy right close to the experimental values, less homologous you can do the ab initio technique that also you can predict with reasonably good accuracy	train
audio_0_115827.wav	And for n th order low pass filter H j omega magnitude will be nothing but 1 plus omega to the power 2 into n, ok	train
audio_0_155828.wav	Here is our input stability circle and here is our smith chart	train
audio_0_140832.wav	so only thing is that you have to see that is i x l, this i x c, because it is	train
audio_0_126074.wav	this I have taken from Robert Boylestad, Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory, this particular graph, just to help you understand what exactly this means	train
audio_0_148130.wav	we moved on to non verbal communication and we did that fairly elaborately, because we talked about non verbal communication in the context of presentation and we talked about non verbal communication even before that in the presentation, in the context of listening and conversation, and we talked about two distinctively different components of non verbal components, ah com communication: the body language, gestures and postures and facial expressions, and i hope that you benefited from the service and the various interactions that we had and in all these cases, we learned a lot of things together	train
audio_0_148397.wav	so you can find, if you do it in that way, it will leave the time for non work activities, and it will	train
audio_0_131886.wav	So, per process you could have one or more enclaves or you could also have a process without any enclaves as well	train
audio_0_3435.wav	And similarly equation 35, then simplifies to based on this neglecting I will put x 2 dash is equal to 0 and that is all right	train
audio_0_13953.wav	So now so, current through 10 ohm resistor is this is also given 4 ampere	train
audio_0_124949.wav	Ready, ok, cool	train
audio_0_103873.wav	So, collective cell migration is applicable to let us say wound healing or even in pathological processes where cancer cells invade collectively	train
audio_0_113035.wav	Now, these chip components whether it is a chip resistor or chip inductor capacitor they come in different sizes, ok	train
audio_0_120510.wav	And that is only possible when there is an integration of the different types of contact history, which is only possible when there is a good database, where everything can come together	train
audio_0_1937.wav	We should have the knowledge of the structure of that fundamental matrix, its properties that it is a singular matrix and also how this matrix relates the corresponding points that requires to be used while fitting a model	train
audio_0_124190.wav	Everything is oxidized, SiO2 silicon dioxide that is what glass is made up of	train
audio_0_143241.wav	so that's angle and its angle is delta r	train
audio_0_105885.wav	So, what the reinforced masonry section of the code actually talks of is three types of walls	train
audio_0_107288.wav	The same applies to brick masonry	train
audio_0_12928.wav	So, if you go for current division these two ampere current, this is my 2 ampere current right, then what is the what is this i	train
audio_0_103375.wav	So, let us assume E is constant	train
audio_0_133649.wav	There were multiple overflow vulnerabilities that were exploited on 32 bit platforms essentially it was a widthness overflow that was exploited while on 64 bit android platforms it was an arithmetic overflow that was exploited	train
audio_0_100907.wav	Let us assume, this is an adherent zone and this is an adherent zone this is adherent	train
audio_0_131762.wav	So, this is not what we want in practice	train
audio_0_167576.wav	So, it is the similar thing is done if you do static cast, if you use C style casting	train
audio_0_27589.wav	so let me write this clearly again: X is x bar transpose 1, x bar transpose 2, x bar transpose 3 and x bar transpose 4	train
audio_0_160341.wav	now we start making an assignment with this four by four matrix	train
audio_0_127619.wav	So, that we have understood and we have also seen about the virtual ground	train
audio_0_19138.wav	I have given you the formulas here in the solution	train
audio_0_14806.wav	So, it will be revived 2 by root 2 will be root 2 right	train
audio_0_153512.wav	So if we integrate this length of the tangent vector over the given domain then we can get the arc length of a curve	train
audio_0_171619.wav	So, now if you see these values, then it will few nucleotides which are rigid and some of them are flexible for example, ATA its ATA; right ATA what is the value for ATA	train
audio_0_122826.wav	Now, we all remember, right, we should all remember that in high pass filter, there was capacitor at the input, and then capacitor was in series with a resistor	train
audio_0_2802.wav	And these two dots are here, this is basically the neutral zone right	train
audio_0_16051.wav	So, if you get i 1 let me let me go through this let me clear it first	train
audio_0_157531.wav	So, only if the load current is continuous, I will have to worry about it	train
audio_0_120585.wav	That almost everything in the world can be seen as you in the x axis, we have intangibility	train
audio_0_142572.wav	of course, standard formula, you know, that is simple thing is i square r, right, but this is require for many places right	train
audio_0_138661.wav	if you put that, that a v s will become z a b c in to a i s	train
audio_0_150882.wav	So, the Laplace inverse of this s over this 2 s square minus 8 the desired one	train
audio_0_157112.wav	So we will have a source, it will go to a power converter circuit which is going to convert the voltage magnitude and frequency as per the requirement of the load	train
audio_0_137808.wav	so v two, two, actually one angle minus three degree	train
audio_0_108272.wav	So, this is the initiation of the initial condition of loading in the wall and as the lateral forces act on the wall you will have a combination of the effects due to the lateral force and that of the gravity forces	train
audio_0_106094.wav	You will be repeating this for every wall, which means you will have to have some rationality in terms of the final choice of compress the strength of unit and compresses strength of motor	train
audio_0_113065.wav	Now, this y L at this particular point what you do	train
audio_0_118158.wav	From here we can get beta which is a phase constant beta is equal to under root omega square mu epsilon minus m pi by a whole square take omega square mu epsilon outside of this root and we will get omega root mu epsilon into under root 1 minus fc by f whole square	train
audio_0_159677.wav	so this is now interpreted as the dual is feasible with seven and five	train
audio_0_19511.wav	Though it is not asked just for better understanding, you may further comment that closure of X and transferring that raw material to Y will further improve the profitability	train
audio_0_129895.wav	So, let us continue our discussion in the next class	train
audio_0_111910.wav	So, this curve again I have taken from the cross book	train
audio_0_108651.wav	We typically prescribe that these are rigid horizontal diaphragms when they are being constructed and are capable of transmitting both gravity and lateral forces	train
audio_0_126067.wav	What is the change in the output voltage, right	train
audio_0_19970.wav	But can you compare 750 with 650	train
audio_0_16981.wav	Then, we want that what will be i 0 plus current division, then it will be for current division path it is multiplied by 6 divided by 6 plus 60 right	train
audio_0_102214.wav	So, what they did was, so in generally in breast cancer patients in 20 to 25 percent of these cases you have EGFR or epidermal growth factor receptor is amplified	train
audio_0_29120.wav	data security: iot data must be secured and protected from the intruders	train
audio_0_143478.wav	but outside radius is given	train
audio_0_129133.wav	Earlier it was 1 volt for one channel, second channel is 2 volts peak to peak	train
audio_0_10023.wav	It is simplified and written to the power minus half you please do little bit of your own	train
audio_0_130937.wav	So, there are two critical aspects in this particular program	train
audio_0_103677.wav	So, pressure into the cross section area is pi r square plus tau into the area because it is the tangential length tangential area	train
audio_0_171070.wav	Then we added some decoys because to see whether decoys are correctly eliminated and the actives are correctly identified	train
audio_0_136132.wav	so it is actually this side, low voltage side, the terminal voltage of generator	train
audio_0_168169.wav	So, it is possible that pure virtual functions may have a body, and that does not take away the virtuality of it	train
audio_0_140917.wav	and this is equation four	train
audio_0_136795.wav	before saying that again we have to little bit to brush up our memories	train
audio_0_19867.wav	You can take the total for all the three months that is the quarter 59 and the total is 2	train
audio_0_11265.wav	This is your v AN, this is v BN, and this is v CN right	train
audio_0_18691.wav	So, much better planning happens in budget	train
audio_0_120929.wav	But, they are a solid partner in the value generating constellation of the business eco system and so on, one hand they can be dispassionate they can be much more process focused they can be much more rule focused	train
audio_0_16857.wav	So, basically, it is is equal to 2 volt	train
audio_0_124036.wav	We will see there is a p type, n type and how, why these flats are there	train
audio_0_119415.wav	Because, that creates this tremendous power of communication through social media, that can change the meaning of a brand, that can change your marketing message	train
audio_0_158599.wav	because when we took the l c m, seven into four, ah with with twenty eight u, this seven and five is thirty five	train
audio_0_3202.wav	888 this side right because as soon as we will make it, that your you will see the 24 20 trade or in your what you call in your what you call that yourdelta to star	train
audio_0_19025.wav	For current, they have asked what is a total employee cost for A and B and also total of the total	train
audio_0_14362.wav	So, what will happen in that case this 2 ampere current will flow through this inductor	train
audio_0_152470.wav	25 and again we will take the middle point here so we have the new value 0	train
audio_0_123377.wav	1 millivolts, and invert non inverting terminal 0 millivolts, right	train
audio_0_159496.wav	we we either keep certain things fixed and subtract, or keep certain things fixed and add	train
audio_0_132060.wav	So, this is an example over here	train
audio_0_110149.wav	So that is, so we've looked at couple of formulations, one based on a linear elastic approach and one which basis, base, bases itself on the inelastic behavior of the material	train
audio_0_126205.wav	If you recall quickly Hartley oscillator this we have seen right, crystal oscillators we have seen, then we have seen UJT oscillators, and its characteristic curve right	train
audio_0_19098.wav	So, the original contribution from B which was, if you remember our last calculation which was 208, now has come down only to 128	train
audio_0_164173.wav	So here I am providing a solution that I will make it a global function which is outside of each of these classes but, what I do I make prod a friend function in both these classes	train
audio_0_121133.wav	To conclude our whole discussion of this week is to focus on the five dimensions of service quality and to understand that loyalty building is a long term process retention is much more important than acquisition and only retention is not give good enough we have to create your system in your service business that you are able to win customer advocacy	train
audio_0_165931.wav	In the same scenario, I have the same base class type pointer; I have the same two objects; and the two scenarios, where this points to the base class object in this it points to the derived class object	train
audio_0_167848.wav	Next, we will talk about a related notion which is known as the Volatile	train
audio_0_167309.wav	So, the fun really starts happening when we start coding, the same concepts as in the C program in terms of C++ style	train
audio_0_137624.wav	so this is the j one matrix	train
audio_0_17897.wav	So multiply it by 1	train
audio_0_127075.wav	But if my gain is infinite, then Vd will be 0 and if Vd is 0, that means, my non inventing terminal is same as the inverting terminal	train
audio_0_129703.wav	Here with the help of magnets these are used to form a beam and then a directed towards a crucible that contains the materials of material of interest is within your crucible within your crucible, right	train
audio_0_2699.wav	Now, suppose we turn on the Geiger counter and wait for 3 minutes without detecting a particle, in this situation, we detect a particle within 30 seconds of starting the counter	train
audio_0_154717.wav	Then as we know for bandpass implementation, we need a series resonator in series or a shunt resonator in shunt	train
audio_0_149455.wav	Sometimes it is convenient and we will also see in some numerical calculations that writing instead of this vector matrix form, this component form is much more convenient	train
audio_0_140604.wav	and motor reactance is point with j, j, j not so, and every not so in everywhere	train
audio_0_26742.wav	So now once use OFDM, you can that the channel coefficients across the subcarrier in the time domain are given by the N point FFT	train
audio_0_117939.wav	Suppose, if the load impedance was 50 Ohm, so what would have happen	train
audio_0_4417.wav	So, in this case this this this diagram I have taken from a book right	train
audio_0_144715.wav	leadership means what	train
audio_0_131745.wav	Thus, at a time when this particular library gets loaded, the loader would look into this table and passed through each row in this table	train
audio_0_162192.wav	And since it takes the type int, it can internally compute, how much space it requires, it can internally do the size of on this int that malloc needs to be explicitly passed, and therefore, it does not need any size specification to be given	train
audio_0_171829.wav	But polymer type is protein DNA then we have a different enzyme classification	train
audio_0_162430.wav	Similarly temp j, this will also need conversion will have a double corresponding to j and then you actually divide these two double numbers and give the result in double	train
audio_0_161338.wav	so that is shown by this x coming now	train
audio_0_142198.wav	therefore, that combination of i r will be the same thing: four thousand five hundred ten point two, cosine delta r dash, ampere	train
audio_0_13525.wav	That is why it is written cos alpha	train
audio_0_152809.wav	So, now, if we compute the flux outward across the S1 so, let us consider this surface S1 whose normal, unit normal vector is 1, 0, 0 because we are talking about so we have let us say direction x here and then we have the y direction and the z, the vertical direction	train
audio_0_173284.wav	So, in this case you can distinguish the bifurcating as well as the multifurcating	train
audio_0_107928.wav	And that is the first inelasticity that occurs in the system under this assumption and you should therefore as the load resistance continues beyond that, get a drop in stiffness, a reduction in stiffness of the system	train
audio_0_122770.wav	So, this is in a way our response mechanisms to the complexities and challenges post by services	train
audio_0_165637.wav	So, if you do not; for example say point class	train
audio_0_151853.wav	So, with this substitution we got that du is equal to dx and there is a factor here square root s k over u square	train
audio_0_107181.wav	I have an opening on this side, I have another opening on the other side, which means there are spandrels interacting, assume it's a window	train
audio_0_104239.wav	If you add a muscle induction factor the expression profile, so this is hMSCs plus muscle induction media	train
audio_0_115018.wav	So, this feedback ratio ensures that A beta is greater than 1 to start the oscillation	train
audio_0_124705.wav	So, V minus which is voltage over here right	train
audio_0_20581.wav	And correspondingly, while the neutron flux has a very sharp deep here, close to the close to that resonance zone, close to that particular energy level, here there deep is smaller, but this drop takes place over much wider energy span	train
audio_0_13673.wav	So, V 1 is 25 Volt, V 2 is equal to 40 Volt and V 4 is equal to your what you call 50 Volt right	train
audio_0_166270.wav	For the static data member, we will see some additional constraints; we will see that the static data member is declared within the class like the ordinary data members	train
audio_0_128882.wav	So, there are two ways, one is you make a PCB printed circuit board, you can see here in this one, right	train
audio_0_144997.wav	so your skills gradually improve	train
audio_0_151950.wav	So we will demonstrate the idea by this simple example but one can go through many more	train
audio_0_165528.wav	So in that case a termination handler will get called	train
audio_0_138866.wav	so, approximately, v will be three in to ten to the power, eight meter per second, which is approximately the velocity of light at frequency sixty hertz, right	train
audio_0_143875.wav	reinforcing is repetition, doing it in different ways, ok, and in different kinds of varieties of ways, and it can be used in different context, as indicated in changing	train
audio_0_17797.wav	So, if you remember we had done some cases on special pricing or say government contracts or those contracts where normal market is not affected	train
audio_0_133495.wav	So, we are accessing the 10th, 11th, 12th and so, on byte	train
audio_0_170134.wav	If we come here with d it is a director object	train

audio_0_21094.wav	And therefore, the term thermal hydraulics is a generally used for simultaneous analysis of heat transfer fluid flow problems and hence in this particular module	train
audio_0_10699.wav	So, next is so, this is a simple example I took for you	train
audio_0_164391.wav	So, if you now look at the first destruction message is for the object d2, that is this message	train
audio_0_133980.wav	So this segment starts at the location 0Xabcd0000 and extends up to 0Xabcdffff, so what we would see is that every memory location within the segment starts with 0Xabcd	train
audio_0_24482.wav	Right, notes and textbooks	train
audio_0_110260.wav	And for the uncracked portion, in the cracked section, you have a triangular distribution	train
audio_0_141845.wav	thats why this: when you take that derivative of this term in general, this is a general expression at that time there is no two sigma because of that derivative, only one sigma, right, so it will be	train

audio_0_25845.wav	that makes a MIMO wireless system	train
audio_0_105111.wav	This is because rock controls central stress fibres	train
audio_0_108396.wav	And in this particular case with the two we are really looking at a condition where the mid height crack is also propagated and we want to understand at what level of lateral load is the failure in the section going to occur so what we are really examining is a condition where the triangular distribution of stresses in compression in the wall has already been reached in the mid height of the wall and then the load keeps increasing and at what stage do you get the section failure	train
audio_0_27907.wav	In other words, if we substitute c bar that is, our least squares equalizer substitute c bar, what do we get	train

audio_0_117755.wav	Basically, you can say mobile phone in an example of RF transceiver	train
audio_0_163466.wav	So, if assignment is an operator then for this assignment symbol, I can write a corresponding operator function operator assignment and pass a and b as two parameters, whenever we write operator function it is very important to remember that the order of the operands, if there are more than one operands, the order of the operands cannot be changed	train
audio_0_128778.wav	So, this is a PN junction diode, you can see there is a this is a diode, which I am holding in my hand right, yes	train
audio_0_27987.wav	okay, And therefore the action of the channel tap is now y is equal to the action of the channel because you are transmitting cyclic prefix added block of samples	train
audio_0_114635.wav	6 ohm; so that means, we can design a 3 way equal power divider in a very simple manner that we design these micro strip lines for an impedance of 86	train
audio_0_11260.wav	Now, we begin by examining the instantaneous power absorbed by the load right, so power in a balanced system so power, because we have to see the three phase power also	train
audio_0_159166.wav	if we want, we can calculate the objective function value, but we are not doing it	train
audio_0_109021.wav	Now why is that good	train
audio_0_14176.wav	So, in this case, what what will happen that ah to get this your i 0 current then ah simplest way what you can do is this is ah although this is a 0 potential, but what your you know for easy calculation say we can make it KVL like this	train
audio_0_104489.wav	At the same time cancer cells in particular can degrade or remodel the ECM	train

audio_0_12504.wav	Similarly, i 2 is equal to your 20 volt, because it is parallel circuit divided by your 60	train
audio_0_151706.wav	So, obviously we cannot just have equality there but their integrals are equal and in the process, as I have said that the two integrals are equal which does not imply that the function is equal to the trigonometric series	train
audio_0_124496.wav	Next, I showed you the application of silicon dioxide in IC industry, where there are thermally grown oxide and deposited oxide, and by changing the thickness, we can apply it for several layers including field oxide, masking oxide, gate oxide, and pad oxides	train

audio_0_170084.wav	I know because when manager was created then certainly this type was passed on	train
audio_0_166415.wav	So, destructor can still remain in the	train
audio_0_115138.wav	And the reason for that is let us say i have a one coupled line and the another line is put quiet far away	train
audio_0_147095.wav	so the whole idea is that we have to understand how groups are formed, what is the psychology, what kind of members are required, how do they behave among themselves and how do they work together to achieve the ultimate goal	train
audio_0_123813.wav	So, this is the what we are understanding about the op amps power supply and op amp outputs how they are taken either they are taken single ended or they are taken double ended either we are applying balanced power supply or we are applying unbalanced power supply ok	train
audio_0_13516.wav	Now if you add ok, right i 1 plus i 2 it will be 5 sin omega t plus 10 sin omega t plus 60 degree	train
audio_0_108574.wav	So you, depending on the material, depending on whether you're looking at concrete grout in a unit, in a concrete unit or a concrete grout sitting in a clay brick unit, perforated clay brick unit, that distinction would have to be made in terms of the limiting compressive strength	train
audio_0_24609.wav	This particular topic we are starting now is called Multi Why, also popularly known as 5 Whys	train

audio_0_152042.wav	But here that sign will remain and then the derivative of x will be 1	train
audio_0_156815.wav	Say small ZL is the normalized impedance that isÉ Now in this method we will be using a combined ZY Smith Chart	train
audio_0_158350.wav	based on multiplying the first constraint by ten, we said the upper estimate is two hundred and ten	train
audio_0_136863.wav	therefore d square, delta, d t square, we can write pi f up on h in to p i	train
audio_0_154266.wav	So, now one other definition which of the Q factor that is frequently used is in terms of the reactive because in microwave circuits, it is not always so simple to find out whether a circuit is inductive or capacitive	train
audio_0_172055.wav	For each data point results are displayed here, the prediction probability for the sum of classifier such as Bayesnet and logistic regression is calculated in the algorithm whereas, for this it is calculated from the results	train
audio_0_29056.wav	one way is basically to use all these big data analytics and so on, but, ah, even before that, can we deduce the processing time of these data	train
audio_0_16662.wav	That is why, I is starting from here, I is starting from here right	train
audio_0_27411.wav	that is y equals h times x h and where this is basically your circular convolution in a time domain, that is, in a domain of the circular convolution, And it is important to remember that this is the circular convolution in the time domain for the samples	train
audio_0_125386.wav	So now, if you can focus here, you see, you can change the voltage from 0 from 0 to 230 volts, it is connected to where	train
audio_0_113181.wav	Now, the same thing can also be done using the graphical method by using Smith Chart	train
audio_0_125913.wav	And we will see that it is still following there is no problem	train
audio_0_27875.wav	instant k minus 1, which is interfering with the symbol xk	train
audio_0_25072.wav	this is known as the cyclic prefix	train
audio_0_142925.wav	so the phase conductors carry zero sequence current, with written first through a ground neutral, grounded neutral	train
audio_0_172202.wav	This is how it works	train
audio_0_140454.wav	so automatically this side will be base voltage will be four thirty three volt	train
audio_0_121905.wav	And as because of that, we get these three main approaches as shown here, cost based pricing; that means, set prices related to your costs and we discussed just now that in services one has to be very careful to measure all the different costs and so activity based costing is a very good way of looking at service pricing	train
audio_0_103142.wav	So, since the last two lectures I have started discussing of some of the tools and techniques that are useful for studying mechanobiology and in the first lecture I introduced about hydrogels	train
audio_0_149250.wav	but then we move on to image and their relationship with texts	train
audio_0_15417.wav	But we have seen earlier that K is equal to we have seen earlier the K trans ratio is equal to N 1 upon N 2 therefore, R 2 dash will be K square into R 2, right	train
audio_0_115357.wav	So, we have a signal generator which is generating a input signal of 500 megahertz frequency and the amplitude is 0 dBm	train
audio_0_126358.wav	So, let us see how the operational amplifier can be used as a differential amplifier	train
audio_0_16800.wav	So, if it is 0, it is T by 4 then T by 2 and so on right	train
audio_0_132629.wav	So, whenever there is a jump like this what would happen internally in a processor is that the entire pipeline would get flushed and new instructions corresponding to these instructions following the label would get fetched from the memory	train
audio_0_104477.wav	So, what you see in this particular case there are 2 bands corresponding to 91 kilo Daltons and a much weaker band at 71 kilo Daltons	train
audio_0_121206.wav	Hello, I am Jayanta Chatterjee from IIT, Kanpur and we are discussing Managing Services, contemporary issues	train
audio_0_148478.wav	do you write daily to do list	train
audio_0_156496.wav	Now, if we as I said, there is a certain cut off frequency for each waveguide, and if we draw a relationship between this beta and omega	train
audio_0_123188.wav	It is also used in biomedical instrumentation and numerous other application now what are the advantages of op amp we already know, right	train
audio_0_153222.wav	And we have in that case once we show that these conditions are satisfied, one can get such a potential function with the process which we have seen in the previous example	train
audio_0_150965.wav	So, the value of this B coefficient is 2/p(1 cos	train
audio_0_141758.wav	right so for leading power factor, you can see that it is not always, but in this case that regulation is negative, right so	train
audio_0_140737.wav	generally you will find that at thirty three k v bus bar voltage may not be thirty three k v	train
audio_0_139233.wav	if it is so, then ct is equal to your sigma	train
audio_0_152865.wav	So there is not like, the magnitude is increasing so, any value x here we fix then in this direction, there is a flow but the magnitude is same	train
audio_0_160448.wav	now there will be as many dual constraints as the number of primal variables	train
audio_0_110589.wav	So, right now if you see the power is minus 45 dBm a type which is quite low and we are going to see the effect of LO power on the if output	train
audio_0_102739.wav	So, when the tip is moving through air the tip does not deform right, because it does not touch anything, but as soon as it touches the surface the tip deforms ok	train

audio_0_142086.wav	that means this, this, this, this long line expression	train
audio_0_161448.wav	so we now have to modify this and bring it to a form which is consistent with the earlier table that we have seen	train
audio_0_3681.wav	Current actually leaving the plane, or leaving the plate, so move it upward	train
audio_0_13152.wav	Now if it is delayed, if for that if that if it is delayed ramp function then it will be r t minus t 0, right	train

audio_0_104804.wav	So, why is this expected	train
audio_0_173622.wav	So, depending upon the sampling you do, depending out the space you walk that will give you the outcome and the outcome varies right and you can repeat to improve chance of success right for example, instead of one million times go to 10000 times, with the result is similar to the one thou one million times then that is fine if you not you can change another chance right also among these times they can choose one and 3 are not good	train
audio_0_11694.wav	You multiply if you multiply and simplify you will find P plus jQ is equal to this one and your your what you call and this imaginary part is this one complex part is this one; that means, your; that means, if you separate real and imaginary part	train
audio_0_163425.wav	So, if you ask the broad question, the abstract question as to what the difference between an operator and a function is, you will find some very significant similarity, because both the operator as well as the function takes some parameters and compute the result	train
audio_0_139257.wav	suppose load has increased, load has changed by delta pl, right	train
audio_0_125320.wav	So, again capacitors are several types again this is not a scope of this particular course, but that can be that can cover under a different course on semiconductor devices, where we can see what is then within the capacitor what are kind of capacitor the kind of diodes	train
audio_0_105585.wav	However, that may be too much to ask for and therefore since you will not be using a PM interaction surface, you need to know what is the for the combination of moments and axial forces at a given wall, you need to know what is the state of stress in the wall	train
audio_0_133580.wav	If s less than 80 then we copy the contents of argv2 into this particular buffer we add slash 0 to that particular buffer at the end of this buffer and then print the particular buffer okay so the expected behaviour would look something like this	train
audio_0_118757.wav	This is port 1, and this is port 2	train
audio_0_173108.wav	So, we discussed about 2 types of supervised learning what are 2 types of supervised learning	train
audio_0_111685.wav	So, if we provide input at this the power will be divided in this and this, but the outputs will be in 180 degree out of phase	train
audio_0_103915.wav	So, what they found was s scaled as t square	train
audio_0_155273.wav	And based on this if you again go back to the diagram on the slide then gain circles that we have drawn are like this	train
audio_0_314.wav	So then the fundamental matrix can be obtained by performing this operation	train
audio_0_124820.wav	If it is a 741 opamp, you have to apply plus minus 15 volts; you know apply plus minus 2 volts peak to peak with a frequency of 5 kilohertz, this is a square wave	train
audio_0_23164.wav	Well we will cool the chocolate before it’s shipped to ultra low temperatures and then ship it with vacuum around it that you can probably pull out the air and send it across so set a cooler environment all through its shipping and at the end you get is the cool chocolates	train
audio_0_128851.wav	So, we do not have a separate connection for the substrate	train
audio_0_130728.wav	Now, if this subroutine modifies this B C H L registers, then once you come back here you see that this B C H L are all modified	train
audio_0_502.wav	So we get this particular so the transformed conics is given by this H minus t C, H inverse, H 1	train
audio_0_166194.wav	So, if I interchange x and y it is same as interchanging a, and b	train
audio_0_122590.wav	So, the weekend if you stay in Hong Kong then some of the ticket will be at a price which is lower, because the airline works in conjunction with Hong Kong tourism board and so on and this is applicable to many other countries	train
audio_0_11080.wav	And this current i mean, it is flowing like this, it is series circuit R C circuit	train

audio_0_115997.wav	You can see the curve from here these are the curves for that and that is equal to minus 6 dB	train
audio_0_22850.wav	But anyway after you sort of analyse right, you’ve got to get into a creative phase, we have to actually then start developing something, you have seen what happens, you have stepped into their shoes a little bit, you have thought through things you have analyse and then you have to come up with something, it can be tangible, physical, it can be something in the digital world, but you got to come up with in some ways solution which you think might fit the problem right, what do you think you do after that	train
audio_0_109218.wav	The behavior is therefore brittle in this particular case	train
audio_0_19845.wav	Now, 12,000 is an opening inventory because last time closing will become opening and if you take 12, the units to be produced are 20	train

audio_0_168826.wav	So, there is one root class and there one base class and there are two derived classes in this	train
audio_0_168024.wav	The destructor of D will never get called, because actually what we needed to be able to destroy this object, we needed the call to land in the destructor of D which in turn would call the destructor of B and do things right that is how it happens	train
audio_0_126245.wav	So, there is a something that we need to take care we need to understand	train

audio_0_25953.wav	And we said OFDM can be used to efficiently overcome, can efficiently overcome ISI or basically Inter Symbol Interference	train
audio_0_151068.wav	For instance the temperature inside the room is defined by the scalar field because temperature is a scalar quantity	train
audio_0_124590.wav	So, this is not a possibility	train
audio_0_152007.wav	So, as a result, what we will get	train
audio_0_122268.wav	Last week, mainly we took an overview of the whole domain of services business and in an edition; we also looked at the service logic, which today is an applicable logic or an applicable business philosophy or creating new business models in general across the world	train
audio_0_120923.wav	But, what is now happening is earlier such service as I was discussing were outsourced on the basis of labor arbitrage and lower cost	train
audio_0_172320.wav	They did the detailed literature search because the included about 60,000 publications right in the database	train
audio_0_129637.wav	Again, I told you we are not interested in understanding the physics behind it we are not industry understanding the physics behind it because that is not the idea is said this is how it is done depositing off metal and you will see what is the advantage disadvantage that is it	train
audio_0_179.wav	So there this kind of dimensional reduction becomes very useful	train
audio_0_172454.wav	For example in the QSAR studies, most of the inhibitor constants right they range from mlili molar or micro molar or nano molar in this case we the wide range	train
audio_0_24261.wav	So, this is the conflict as we have highlighted, so this is a visual way to convey this conflict	train
audio_0_28675.wav	One is 1 plus 1, j, 1 minus j, minus 1 plus j minus 1 minus j	train
audio_0_116955.wav	So, we have here instead of writing Z 0s, Z 0 we have written here 1 and these impedances are normalized	train
audio_0_16758.wav	So, similar way if you proceed right	train
audio_0_144451.wav	so at many times it happens in school, colleges, some of the friends also call by some nicknames and then students feel very bad	train
audio_0_29048.wav	so we know that, ah, now, it is because of all this, different sensors, etcetera, etcetera, there is lot of data that is floating all around	train
audio_0_152860.wav	So, if we take any point anywhere, and then we see that the around this point, the fluid, the tendency is for the compression, so because this divergence negative itself signifies that or we can visualize that and conclude the similar effect	train
audio_0_104877.wav	Whatever with the relaxation curve for gamma soarcoglycan deficient cells the curve was somewhat like this	train
audio_0_162422.wav	So, in many a times, we will see that compiler actually needs to allocate separate storage for this cast value and then initialize that with the casting process	train
audio_0_28043.wav	So, remember, we have H 3, H 1, remember, equals h 0 minus j h 1, and H 3 equals h 0 plus j h 1, which implies writing this as vectors, Writing this using matrix notation	train
audio_0_155778.wav	This is the unit circle in the smith chart and this horizontally shaded region is our output stability circle	train
audio_0_12450.wav	It is your V oc right this is 1 and 2 1 is positive 2 is negative arbitrary, you have we have taken if you want you can take 2 positive 1 negative, it does not matter arbitrary it has been taken right	train
audio_0_166771.wav	So, if initialization of one data member is dependent on the initialization of the other, it will matter as to which data member is initialized earlier and which is initialized later	train
audio_0_151886.wav	So, we got this Laplace inverse and we also know the Laplace inverse of 1 over s minus 1 that power t	train
audio_0_119987.wav	We create tangible queues, metaphors, examples, images, which create a lingering good feeling, which we want to feel to create a feel good reaction, impression, experience, after consumption of service	train
audio_0_152870.wav	So, there is a one more point here that the vector field v for which this divergence is 0, everywhere is called Solenoidal	train
audio_0_27822.wav	the norm of the vector square is basically submission k equal to 1 to N x k square	train
audio_0_121270.wav	And I am quite sure from the quality of the various submissions that I have reviewed, which are already available on the forum that most of you will do quite well at the exam	train
audio_0_125510.wav	hHence the output voltage v Vo follows V i until it is exceeds c V c voltage	train
audio_0_107199.wav	We will examine the use of masonry as a structural solution from ancient times to the present	train

audio_0_117824.wav	So, here we have actually designed a broadband monopole antenna	train
audio_0_161918.wav	so minus one by five is minus three by fifteen	train
audio_0_166092.wav	So, if I, if we do this, then the first output will come from this slide before the function call, which is this output, which tells me a is at this location	train
audio_0_17852.wav	So, you are getting 1490 and 1219	train
audio_0_24266.wav	So, you can actually do this, work on this	train
audio_0_124343.wav	In the next 2 lectures, we will be focusing more on the fabrication part and sometime around the end of another 2 lectures, will you be able to understand how you can fabricate a MOSFET or at least draw the process flow for fabricating a MOSFET	train
audio_0_151122.wav	So, if we take the unit vector b in the direction of del f	train
audio_0_108423.wav	So, this is an assumption which is erring on the conservative side and so is an acceptable assumption itself	train
audio_0_133218.wav	The way secure boot works is by something known as a chain of trust so starting from the root device there is a trust created in the system based on this particular mechanism it becomes very difficult to tamper with	train
audio_0_19202.wav	Now, once this 5 calculations are done, you have not only done it, you have also understood it	train
audio_0_125144.wav	You connect it to black, and common is same,	train
audio_0_2885.wav	So, I am now cleaning it	train
audio_0_114754.wav	So, we will see; what are the different type of microwave diodes are there and how these diodes can be used for attenuation purpose RF switches as well as phase shifters	train
audio_0_143742.wav	that means whatever biological system is working to manage stress is same	train
audio_0_10431.wav	So, that is why your E 2 square is equal to V 2 plus I 2 R e 2 square plus I 2 X e 2 square; that means, your that E 2 is equal to square root of this one	train
audio_0_3458.wav	So, in your what you called generally the power it is AC, but we use some kind of mechanism such that it will your what you call it will be converted to DC right	train
audio_0_124709.wav	Now, a typical offset current of an Op Amp is 200 nano amperes it results that within Op Amp has a feedback resistance of one mega ohm, the Op Amp would produce an output voltage of 200 into 1 which is 200 milliampere for 0 input offset voltage this much is the change	train
audio_0_122847.wav	This you can do again with simulation, and you can find it whetherif it makes sense or not, right	train
audio_0_103903.wav	So, you have these rectangular patches and you have created empty spaces when you remove the stencil	train
audio_0_134225.wav	Thus, what is a certain by the EEXTEND instruction is that the creation of these various EPC pages is exactly similar or has exactly the same signature of what as what the application developer intended	train
audio_0_28916.wav	this data variable has been assigned a single string, that is, one, two, three, comma, abc, comma, xyz, one, two	train
audio_0_153910.wav	Now suppose we have a load connected let us consider a simple load Z and say it is normalised impedance is this, so this small z is equal to this	train
audio_0_166354.wav	So, the output should be 500, and then I construct a print job object	train
audio_0_151379.wav	So, let me just explain here	train
audio_0_166362.wav	So, if they get destructed then the number of jobs will come down from 3 to 1	train
audio_0_165255.wav	So, it returned the same x	train
audio_0_24576.wav	Referring online, offline reference materials for further learning	train
audio_0_163106.wav	6, I could not have meant this function g, even though g has one parameter, even though g has a type parameter type which is double, which is the type of 5	train
audio_0_156834.wav	So now on the circuit what this corresponds is 2 is I had my YL, I added a piece of transmission line whose length is theta and at this point I have my G in equal to 1	train
audio_0_171332.wav	They are at these different ranks 18, 32 and 105 at least we can see all these compounds in the top 120 hits; among these 2	train

audio_0_109724.wav	The moulded bricks are typically poorer quality in both in terms of strength and durability in comparison to wire cut bricks	train
audio_0_161881.wav	second one: we have to write carefully: minus m into three by five, minus three m by five, minus fourteen by five	train
audio_0_158332.wav	so when x one x two is greater than or equal to zero, thirty x one plus thirty x two will be greater than or equal to ten x one plus nine x two, because x one and x two are greater than or equal to zero	train
audio_0_121356.wav	So, whether it is the workforce for the negative constraint going to efficient resource, they become they innovative creation fountain head	train
audio_0_112685.wav	So, if you want to use this particular transistor at lower frequencies, we must try to optimize the input impedance of this particular transistor	train
audio_0_105423.wav	Okay, so what happens	train
audio_0_123139.wav	V plus then we have second negative supply voltage terminal minus Vcc which is this one	train
audio_0_156484.wav	So let us 1st start with what we call as a parallel plate waveguide	train
audio_0_122235.wav	So, that the relationship I can last and both parties can co operative which other	train
audio_0_139075.wav	with this we get delta delta two	train
audio_0_149549.wav	So, that means if we take the starting values now this that is this xk replaced by this 1, 1, 1, the benefit now here in the in this matrix form that after just matrix vector multiplication, we will get the all components the value of all components, we do not have to compute 1 by 1	train
audio_0_21400.wav	Fusion refers to 2 lighter nucleus combining together to form a heavier nucleus	train
audio_0_107999.wav	So, we will have to make an assumption on at what stage how much of length is going to be available as a contact for the wall to develop the maximum clamping force available	train
audio_0_20860.wav	Or in the eastern part of Russia, but the feasible reason being the absence of corresponding Uranium or other kind of fuels	train
audio_0_142783.wav	so, but for the sake of your mathematics and completeness, we have to make this equation: i one, i two, i three, i four is equal to: this is y matrix v one, v, two, v, three, v four, right	train
audio_0_103600.wav	So, you might have a behaviour like this	train
audio_0_168042.wav	So, we say that the destructor tries to slice the object; it tries to chop off that object at this point, and only does releases one part	train
audio_0_117550.wav	In push pull connection two transistors are used, so here is the push pull arrangement of two transistors the transistors are NPN transistors and these are the common emitter configurations	train
audio_0_10411.wav	That means, when load is not there say no load condition right and V 2 f l is full load secondary voltage, it is assumed to be adjusted to the rated secondary voltage right	train
audio_0_165858.wav	The compiler has got to see that p has been defined as of A type pointer	train
audio_0_157455.wav	That is true but the motor inductance again you have to compare the armature time constant compared to the mechanical time constant	train
audio_0_159525.wav	if we look at this one where two has become one, u i plus v j is six plus zero	train
audio_0_118416.wav	And v LO is less than 0, D 1 and D 4 will be on	train
audio_0_169276.wav	But this entry number one was a colon colon g, but now you have over written that, so that gets over written with c colon colon g	train
audio_0_131564.wav	We will take a shell code and we will inject the shell code into a dummy program and then force this shell code to execute	train
audio_0_170857.wav	If the same question is occupied we all the molecules then the occupancy is 1, depending upon the bindings, it may have different orientations if they have different conformation then the occupancy is split so that the total will be equal to 1	train
audio_0_11565.wav	So, it is 40 volt right this is all volt right 40 volt similarly V C is equal to minus j X into I because of minus j angle minus 90 degree	train
audio_0_28902.wav	for this to happen, you need to split your data at the data log and once this data has been split and individual data can be accessed, we can go about plotting this data	train
audio_0_103667.wav	Let us take a small fluid element in the center	train
audio_0_24203.wav	So as designers, as design thinkers, we are in a manner of speaking greedy people, we want no touching and we want measurements to be perfect	train
audio_0_130927.wav	So, what we seen was that an attacker could use this buffer overflows to inject code into a program and then force that particular code to execute	train

audio_0_104422.wav	One easy way to do is to take the endpoints	train
audio_0_136314.wav	so one, two, n is connected	train
audio_0_1014.wav	So we can show that there exists a homography between these two points	train
audio_0_156161.wav	Now the impedance of this transmission line with the load connected at one end, we saw from the previous slide that the input impedance ZD here is given by this equation	train
audio_0_2989.wav	So, look this is the circuit diagram right and it is given that your what you call that 230 volt shunt motor with a constant main field drives a load whose torque is proportional to the cube of the speed	train
audio_0_809.wav	So that is a geometric interpretation	train
audio_0_126023.wav	And to make this output voltage 0, a small voltage in millivolts a small voltage in millivolts is required to be applied to one of the input terminals, alright	train
audio_0_169854.wav	So the first of them i here is certainly non default parameter which is mandatorily required and the second parameter d that you specify is taken to be double	train
audio_0_107575.wav	The stresses under compression would vary because the net area is lesser than the gross area	train
audio_0_140080.wav	i got few more examples, but time will be limited	train
audio_0_121770.wav	We discussed yesterday, that most excellent globally recognised services often start in this quadrant, which we call fully focused; that means a service package, which is focused on a particular market segment with a particular package of offering	train
audio_0_2048.wav	So you can see in this particular diagram see if if this is the equation of the straight line which has been no given by this equation y equals mx plus c then given x i say this is your value of y	train
audio_0_164485.wav	If we look at this some class instances with that, suppose we have created an instance like it in string naturally this specifies both of them	train

audio_0_171242.wav	3 is here	train
audio_0_20611.wav	Note there this log of 1 by p at 300 Kelvin, can be an can also be written as log of minus log of p at 300 Kelvin, but we have kept this minus sign outside because we always want this alpha prompt to be negative	train
audio_0_170029.wav	So, in view of this the whole challenge is to how we make a suitable extensible flexible design for the salary processing	train
audio_0_14115.wav	So, we have to find out your what you call that your short circuit current, ah you have to find out R N and i N; i N is equal to i s c the short circuit current right	train
audio_0_2238.wav	So, the control chart gives you some estimation or some data regarding, you know the interpretation regarding how the data etcetera is plotted	train
audio_0_148946.wav	others may, others may, focus in just one aspect of creativity: like creativity, like divergent thinking, or problems have resolving, and so on	train
audio_0_103958.wav	So, cells will attach to this, but not on the surrounding areas	train
audio_0_152068.wav	So, U x s into x power s that is the again the linear differential equation and we can think about this integrating factor	train
audio_0_154837.wav	Now if I expand this gamma in2 further according to same formula I get this equal to	train
audio_0_166669.wav	So, they are keywords now reserved as well	train
audio_0_122055.wav	And there will be always production line components in the service, but the whole service maybe very much like a line that we discussed a little while back, it is a flow chart	train
audio_0_26623.wav	So what we are going to talk about from today is basically to develop a framework for vector vector parameter, vector parameter, vector parameter estimation, and in fact, the keyword here is this word, which is basically a vector	train
audio_0_164291.wav	So, nothing else changes in this code, when now in the print member function of class D, we try to refer to data which again is B : : data , is this member	train
audio_0_132345.wav	Now all of these different types of malloc implementations originate from one specific implementation by Doug Lea you could actually search for Doug Lea and find the 1st implementation of malloc most other malloc implementations are derived from Doug Lea’s implementation	train
audio_0_103224.wav	So, you can actually track the dynamic	train
audio_0_116666.wav	Of course, this concept can be extended to 16 by 16 array or even 32 by 32 array to realize much larger gain	train
audio_0_129955.wav	This is a voltage follower	train
audio_0_128240.wav	So, do not worry about it	train
audio_0_25258.wav	So now, substituting y bar of k, substituting y bar of k equals h x bar k plus v bar k	train
audio_0_128181.wav	Changing the material, right	train
audio_0_155906.wav	Now this can be considered as a summation of 2 equal and opposite signals A1 upon 2 and A1 upon 2	train
audio_0_115452.wav	So, here you can see that the isolation between these ports is less than 20 dB throughout this particular frequency range	train
audio_0_127709.wav	We can find these three values, that is, i1, i2, i3	train
audio_0_116551.wav	So, this table shows effect of the dielectric constant	train
audio_0_162385.wav	The word implicit here particularly mean that when we do this kind of a conversion, we actually do not write anything extra in the source could to say that I am doing this kind of a conversion	train
audio_0_170223.wav	When we want to model the landline phone, we identify that if I have a landline phone; however, primitive you can think about those black heavy sets with rotating dial that, we use to use several years ago	train
audio_0_130068.wav	So, the advantage is when we use a Op Amp, then the loading effect can be avoided, so no loading problem in case of active filters	train
audio_0_103523.wav	This is one reason why cone plate rheometer is preferred	train
audio_0_104038.wav	Why must you know what might be the possible reason in which this process is happening	train

audio_0_133515.wav	Essentially what he is going to put is this address location BA	train
audio_0_127750.wav	iIf you talk about band reject filter and, low pass filter is at the input and high pass filter is at the output right	train
audio_0_131494.wav	So, lets, actually start this demo	train
audio_0_12753.wav	ah You have to actually here know understanding is more required	train
audio_0_109840.wav	So, we use this definition of failure of the joint itself to the set of equations that we have developed earlier for the Manmuller criterion in the case where the level of stress is due to pre compression is low	train
audio_0_103906.wav	So, not a single cell has died in this particular assay that is one of the strength of assay	train
audio_0_167902.wav	You try that the result is 25	train
audio_0_139029.wav	this is also three bus problem	train

audio_0_162765.wav	To summarize, we have introduced here the basic notions of restrictions on inheritance in terms of private and protected inheritance	train
audio_0_141411.wav	but you have to see that primary or secondary per unit values will remain same	train
audio_0_121062.wav	But, before the three tier segregation comes much later, when you have different types of offerings and different segments of market that you are serving, initially it is important to focus on one segment and very clear cut offering, matching the requirement of that particular segment that is the foundation, where you start building loyalty	train
audio_0_163532.wav	So, you add these two the result is 1 plus 2, 3 and you assign that to x and you see that you have output a value 3	train
audio_0_12050.wav	So, that and we assume delta is equal to 0; so, cos delta is equal to 1 right	train
audio_0_103879.wav	So, the question is that what drives this wound healing what are the factors that trigger wound healing	train
audio_0_138135.wav	now let us see this one, now seq[uence] sequence network of a loaded synchronous machine	train

audio_0_169158.wav	This is the basic style of doing this	train
audio_0_116684.wav	So, if I reduce the power by 1000 times then the time taken will be 1000 times more	train
audio_0_18510.wav	Now we divide this total cost into two components, variable and fixed	train
audio_0_19537.wav	If you remember we have already discussed techniques like marginal costing, CVP analysis, BEP, most of them were useful for decision making	train
audio_0_16844.wav	So, when switch is closed for long time, so, that we have to find out	train
audio_0_154.wav	So you have less correlations but for high correlations it so for adjacent samples it is expected they should be very highly correlated	train
audio_0_167273.wav	So, address which has only one type that is of the pointed type, but their type is decided based on what kind of value they are actually pointing to	train
audio_0_101171.wav	So, including one at serine 22, one at serine 390, one at this is a sorry, this is a cysteine 522, here serine 390 and many others ok	train
audio_0_18116.wav	Are you getting so for product mix 1	train
audio_0_119773.wav	99 percent of safety record	train
audio_0_20003.wav	So, 750 into 9 the input actual input cost will be 6755	train
audio_0_152171.wav	But what we have observed that with the help of CR equations, we can conclude the same that the function is not differentiable, because the CR equations are not satisfied at any point	train
audio_0_154886.wav	Then the gain T can be given by a formula this as shown here	train
audio_0_20121.wav	But that is not particularly true for nuclear accident because the radiation effect that any kind of radioactive nuclei contains that always remains whether it is inside a nuclear plant or it is somewhere outside	train
audio_0_16382.wav	So, let me let me clear it and similarly for q 2 the charge on C 2 is equal to 0 initial charge on C 2 is equal to actually 0 right	train
audio_0_133313.wav	Therefore when the response goes back to the server, the server would be able to identify that this response does not match the response stored in the database and therefore it would reject the device, it would say that the authentication is not successful, so one aspect that is an issue with PUF based authentication technique is the case of the man in the middle	train
audio_0_128086.wav	It means that we are using a single crystal to fabricate our integrated circuit	train
audio_0_158516.wav	or eight, similarly this seven	train

audio_0_27925.wav	okay, So now what we want to do is we want to simplify this expression that weíve derived for the ëapproximation errorí, but before that, let us explore the properties of this matrix PH	train
audio_0_3095.wav	And one additional node is neutral that we will see your n, that we will see later for the AC circuit not here we will not see those things here right	train
audio_0_23323.wav	I am trying to get wrap my brain around that	train
audio_0_107729.wav	So, what this rigid offset basically means is that the calculated H effective is only a deformable part of the original pier	train
audio_0_163352.wav	So far all the examples we have seen either the five multiply functions or the add functions here, the number of parameters have been same in all cases, but this is not mandatory for function overloading	train
audio_0_159263.wav	they will automatically become the initial set of variables and we can also see that, corresponding to x, three and x four, we have the identity matrix, which is here: one, zero, zero, one	train
audio_0_22236.wav	And I found out that the people had devoted a lot of time into praying Buddha, Lord Buddha	train
audio_0_162357.wav	So, following this you can start writing your operators and I have shown examples as in string and enum that, you really though the rules have to be strictly followed, but they are quite intuitive and straight forward and taking the examples that I have discussed here	train
audio_0_161925.wav	so the basic variables will have zero value	train
audio_0_26595.wav	this is the observations parameterised by the parameter vector H bar, The likelihood function of the observations Y bar, parameterised by H bar, which is the parameter vector	train
audio_0_162514.wav	So, this resultant expression is an object which has this pointer which does not point to a constant object it points to a non constant object now and therefore, you can it is to call the set function on this	train
audio_0_161900.wav	so variable x two will come in and variable a one will go out	train
audio_0_436.wav	Similarly E prime transpose F is also equal to 0 and E prime is the left null vector of F in the same way	train
audio_0_2579.wav	And therefore there is something called the gain of or amplification the signal factor finally, resulting in an output response of the system etcetera	train
audio_0_17722.wav	So, pessimistic calculation is 10, optimistic calculation is 15	train
audio_0_108128.wav	So this is a way of accounting for your in one way bending action, vertical or horizontal the clamping forces that can come because of arching mechanism available in masonry	train
audio_0_23876.wav	So let’s put all that down into the word of engaging meaning your options something that is coming as new so let’s put it all down into the fact that digital learning is more engaging	train
audio_0_21836.wav	But when something is important, I do make it a point of noting it down	train
audio_0_125903.wav	The longer one wherever you see is connected to the signal, and the shorter one is connected to the ground	train
audio_0_125731.wav	Again which is similar thing, what we have is d by d V G S of m square this is nothing but 2 times m d by d VGS of m	train
audio_0_171417.wav	We get similar structures and focus on these two conformations; the two sites, mainly you can see I showed this here; DFG motif	train
audio_0_163811.wav	And you will have to be you will be able to figure out has to how they are deducing the type	train
audio_0_20873.wav	I personally feel that, most of that can be ascribed to the lack of knowledge about the technology	train
audio_0_108544.wav	And whenever there is continuity of the wall, that the continuous ends where you have tension reinforcement at the supports there is a requirement for continuing the tension reinforcement across the support so at least 50% of the tension steel that is required at the mid span and at least 25% of that should be carried through the support and anchored effectively into either the return walls or the slabs whatever be the boundary	train
audio_0_18285.wav	Because volume impacts the cost, it impacts some cost, it does not impact some cost that is fixed and variable as per the variability of the cost	train
audio_0_157161.wav	As I told you in power converters I can have AC to DC to DC which I may call as rectifier	train
audio_0_26157.wav	okay, That is important, as we have said in several practical applications, because we cannot recompute the um estimate at every time instant, right	train
audio_0_16521.wav	But, in the case of R this is this is only R right	train
audio_0_120183.wav	So, like very of few you know about CT scan the full name being computed tomography	train
audio_0_18674.wav	The next is directing	train
audio_0_16263.wav	So, in between 0 to 2 right let me move little bit up	train
audio_0_138935.wav	right, so that means when you have your this thing j, this kind of condition, that there is no reactive power in the line, right, then what does it mean for surge impedance loading	train
audio_0_169508.wav	Now, when we are ready to specify as to what this function will compute or how this function will compute the result from the parameters, then we provide the function body; which is the whole function body is a compound statement	train
audio_0_14829.wav	So, now if you see that you are what you call that we know the reactance is equal to L upon A mu, that we know that is L upon A mu 0 mu r ampere turns	train
audio_0_153959.wav	And from here we see that we can also, we have a path along this constant conductance circle where G equal to 1 to the origin	train
audio_0_109671.wav	So a single lintel, right, it's at the lintel level	train
audio_0_106520.wav	1 6th is that for the linear elastic, the key situation where you have no tension but full compression and then 1 quarter and 1 3rd where you start getting tension in the cross section	train
audio_0_153293.wav	If f and g are continuous and are of exponential order and then if we have this F s is equal to G s, if the Laplace transform are equal for this s greater than s naught then f t would be also equal to g t for all t	train
audio_0_26843.wav	And we said we are not going to load all the subcarriers with pilot symbols, rather, we are going to load only to symbols, that is, corresponding to subcarriers	train
audio_0_105183.wav	In other words, edge, your flow network turnover is mostly negative because there is no new polymerization this is negative and, we are plotting E versus F, E versus flow edge displacement is backward	train
audio_0_105216.wav	So, how come at you know this you have this continuous retrograde flow you have something flowing ahead	train
audio_0_1371.wav	Whereas for the case of range image, there is a continuous, you know, a continuous change of the functional value and those ages you have a differential change you have you have a I mean the discontinuity is not so sharp and it's like an kind of a plane planner it's a It's a intersection of two planes in the functional map and that is producing an edge	train
audio_0_131616.wav	These fall into this category of bugs in the systems software	train
audio_0_135588.wav	both will remain constant	train
audio_0_151674.wav	Now, we will move further with more assumptions, this was the first one that if we integrate the function and the series assuming that these two are equal, we got one relation of a0 to the function	train
audio_0_130376.wav	I have told you earlier also I am repeating it here, source and substrates are connected internally that is why you will find MOSFET I cs with only 3 terminals, only 3 terminals source gate and drain ok	train
audio_0_21514.wav	So is there a form of soft copy of this study material that you been given It is mostly the presentations which we are taught from the class that is only sent to us via mail or there send to this app called Moodle	train
audio_0_21904.wav	So reference books, websites which could give me some more insights about, or detailed view about that thing, or some portals which are the education portals which helps in gaining more knowledge or shortcut tricks for those particular things	train
audio_0_162501.wav	With this trick you can call the function in this particular case, and because you are using const cast anybody who reads to this code will immediately understand that you needed to strip the const ness from c, and therefore, you have used it	train
audio_0_145719.wav	when you look at these four lines, they don't make any sense until you just convert or converge on this bottle	train
audio_0_113057.wav	2 you locate here you have 2 minus Z you go down and that is value is over here Z L	train
audio_0_167240.wav	So, we whatever you access last are what are printed	train
audio_0_142892.wav	now, if you, if you make it a matrix, is known to you right a	train
audio_0_121022.wav	So, this is, what we say, that the service providers act according to a define role and follow a certain script	train
audio_0_26165.wav	This is your N dimensional output vector	train
audio_0_19174.wav	Now here since are many factors, we have made slightly a different type of table which might make it slightly easy for you	train
audio_0_103178.wav	So, what you have is a section of the cell, the cell is exerting internal forces	train
audio_0_118358.wav	So, this arrangement is very important, ah you cannot have any arbitrary arrangement of diodes, and still achieve balancing	train
audio_0_1510.wav	So, there the geometry concept of geometry space those are those are to be considered	train
audio_0_14828.wav	So, you have to find out this is figure 18, L 1, L 2, M 1 2, M 2 1 each coil is excited with 1 ampere current first will see that coil 1 is excited with 1 ampere current right	train
audio_0_171444.wav	Finally, you can select these compounds; so, when we compare the experiments you can see the direct interaction between the ligand as well as with the amino acids	train
audio_0_166050.wav	So, the reference also will have to be a constant one	train
audio_0_108000.wav	Again, the thickness of the wall is considered as T and as you can see we have taken length L and thickness T in the wall	train
audio_0_132651.wav	out of order and speculative execution can be actually used to gain secret information out of the processor	train
audio_0_100180.wav	You should stop when you get that what the piece of work that one person can do within one or two weeks, then you estimate the cost for the lowest level activities	train
audio_0_10360.wav	But, we are made it on the refer to the secondary side, this is the copper loss right this R e 2 into I 2 square and this is R e 2	train
audio_0_127942.wav	An integrated circuit; as you can see here, is an IC; that is what I have shown you, right	train
audio_0_168697.wav	So, for a class x, the this pointer of its object will be x star const this, which x star tells it the this is a pointer to a class type of a object and const after this star of the pointer type tells us that this is a constant pointer that is you cannot change the value of this pointer, which is what make sense because we are saying that this is the address of an object	train
audio_0_127014.wav	I do not have the DC power supply, I I do not have the measurement systems like multimeter, can I still calculate the input offset current	train
audio_0_110950.wav	It is determinant of S matrix S 1 1 S 2 2 minus S 1 2 S 2 1 and when delta is less than 1 and K is greater than 1, then amplifier is unconditionally stable	train

audio_0_159883.wav	start making assignments, first start by looking at the rows and then look at the columns, and so on	train
audio_0_118707.wav	Now, just start this parameter sweep	train
audio_0_147574.wav	now some of you can say: why not	train
audio_0_160051.wav	therefore it move from one corner point to an adjacent corner point and keeps traveling this corner points till the optimum solution is found	train
audio_0_152925.wav	So, this object will start rotating and so, there is a tendency of rotation and again this thumb rule will be applicable	train
audio_0_10371.wav	Now, therefore, we can assume or we can write that copper loss is equal to x square into W c; W c is equal to I 2 square f l R e 2, it is called full load copper loss	train
audio_0_2897.wav	So, in that case armature current is equal to load current is equal to field current for series motor	train
audio_0_105341.wav	The cavity walls would primarily mean you have placed the reinforcement in position, you have constructed the two leaves and you might need shuttering on the sides or depends on whether there is wall construction that is continuing, return walls that are continuing and then you basically grout that cavity	train
audio_0_3648.wav	So, number of revolutions per second because we have taken speed rpm revolution per minute	train
audio_0_138877.wav	thats why i have written for quick calculation it is easier to use sixty seven and equation sixty seven and sixty eight	train
audio_0_113152.wav	So, we can say that y 2 will be 1 and now the value will be minus	train
audio_0_152492.wav	Because the point this x star is called fixed point of a function g if we have x star is equal to gx	train
audio_0_1964.wav	There, mean square error is expressed in terms of norm of a difference vector, mean of the norm of difference vectors	train

audio_0_109772.wav	Random double construction is one of the uncoast masonry constructions, wall constructions, where both in elevation and in cross section you wouldn't see a pattern	train
audio_0_156395.wav	So if we choose a filter with a characteristics like this, what will happen is because the gain is low over here, this gain the inherent gain at a particular frequency will be brought down while the gain at the other frequency when we donÕt want it to be attenuated will continue remaining the same	train
audio_0_172990.wav	Second one is the best right	train

audio_0_172532.wav	So, there is a amide bond in the given ligand, now we are allowing them also rotatable	train
audio_0_123650.wav	Now, you know that how this how this chip or what is there within the silicon chip	train
audio_0_14349.wav	So, now note that we select the inductor current this is important will should keep it in your mind	train
audio_0_15039.wav	Now c is the full load speed, so n f l you can just replace this suffix 0 by fl; n f l is equal to n S 1 minus S f l this is your 1000 and S f l is 0	train
audio_0_168017.wav	I do not get the destructor of D, I do not get this printed fine	train
audio_0_118437.wav	And this diode arrangement as we can see, will give the desired mixing which is the mixing of omega RF and omega LO, even if we are supplying half the LO frequency	train
audio_0_15223.wav	So, n S is equal to you know 120 f by P, so in this case it is 8 pole machine right	train
audio_0_13334.wav	So, f is the frequency and omega is equal to 2 pi f	train
audio_0_21953.wav	So while you were listening to these tapes, would you again like to write	train
audio_0_18018.wav	We always start with calculation of contribution and PV ratio	train
audio_0_154163.wav	The problem with microstrip line, is that, if you can come back to our written slides	train
audio_0_10086.wav	In the case of D C circuit, because in D C supply	train
audio_0_126371.wav	So, this is like a potential divider	train

audio_0_121879.wav	Today, to enable a good analysis with respect to this assignment, I am going to provide some more inputs and thoughts on pricing	train
audio_0_165296.wav	This variable t no more exists, that is dead	train
audio_0_141672.wav	now how to find out	train
audio_0_112379.wav	One more thing I want to emphasize in this window you can see all the parameters whatever we entered	train
audio_0_102068.wav	And this zone internal zone is called the lamella	train
audio_0_163561.wav	And they could be invoked with a dot operator much in the same way that the data members are accessed	train
audio_0_162213.wav	Finally, when you are done, you will if you had allocated the memory by malloc, you need to free it release it by a call to the free function	train
audio_0_111259.wav	Do not keep cell phone in your hand pocket for a long remember it is transmitting a 1 pulse per minute to may be to several pulses per minute to the base station	train
audio_0_144667.wav	you know feelings, emotion, these are the ah things ah	train
audio_0_101413.wav	For viscoelastic materials like ECM networks, this is a simple example of how the stress strain curve would look if you make a collagen gel and put it in a uniaxial tester which kind of keeps on pulling it repeatedly	train
audio_0_113518.wav	So, this mode is 10 but the other mode which can come over here that can be now, 01 mode	train
audio_0_152094.wav	We can now consider the boundary conditions	train
audio_0_10746.wav	Now, this one a current source is there is i s equal to 3 ampere and a dependent current source is there where i x is equal to 3 into i s	train
audio_0_11238.wav	Similarly, for V BN, and similarly for V CN right	train
audio_0_21122.wav	So, here the nuclear salt is generally dissolved in normally heavy water and also acid	train
audio_0_16282.wav	So, naturally ah only current flowing is i naturally voltage across this also will be v right and this capacitor is Ceq equivalent circuit	train
audio_0_118811.wav	So, to do that again, you enable local coordinates system	train
audio_0_117722.wav	Now, these days ah there are several jails where prisoners are actually able to smuggle in the mobile phones and then they do anti social activities even though they are in the prison	train
audio_0_104471.wav	What is also interesting is that this secretion; this secretion of MMP is dictated by the passive stiffness of the substrate	train
audio_0_17147.wav	Now, if you come ah this thing i 1 infinity and i 2 infinity, right; now, as this is as this is open, as this is open and this is also open right and in that case, you have to find out that your i 2 infinity and i this is open	train
audio_0_2191.wav	So, you divide that where the number of observations or sub groups that is 16 and record this is 758	train
audio_0_25015.wav	This is very nice, I am assuming you have also going to detail one more persona; That was our discussion	train
audio_0_171532.wav	So, this is the server for the Dali	train
audio_0_127006.wav	3 millivolts good all right so,s, 6	train
audio_0_20632.wav	They couple the load on the turbine with the recirculation flow systems	train
audio_0_141281.wav	so this is actually ohm right because this is your z base old	train
audio_0_122870.wav	Put the formula and find the values	train
audio_0_17793.wav	Using that, you can calculate on this cost they are asking or they are trying or they are desiring a margin of 20% on cost	train
audio_0_168019.wav	Now if we apply our mind and think about what is going on in terms of the binding see this destructor, destructors are in a way are member functions which are defined here as non virtual	train
audio_0_28385.wav	This h hat minus h	train
audio_0_154627.wav	So in summary for this lecture I would like to say that in this lecture we have, we have covered the basics of not the basics we have covered gone little more in depth in to the properties of the S parameters for 2 port networks	train
audio_0_118544.wav	As the name crossed field itself suggest that the fields are perpendicular to each other	train
audio_0_105971.wav	So we are going to be examining that under different conditions in a few minutes	train
audio_0_3755.wav	So, this another one is your b c d e b, this a b e f a, another one is b c d e b	train
audio_0_108867.wav	So, the minimum spacing requirements between the vertical steel has to be taken into account anyway	train
audio_0_142733.wav	right, why we have taken this, this, everything, this two sources, right, this two, one you transform in to your what you call that current source, right	train
audio_0_171562.wav	7 by 16 this equal to	train
audio_0_163026.wav	So, whenever you overload operator new this size t n must be the first parameter that must be specified without that the operator new will not work	train
audio_0_125838.wav	If we do not show that it is not grounded, it is not correct, because when you are taking voltage you are applying voltage and you are measuring voltage is always with respect to ground	train
audio_0_106251.wav	Now the diagonal crack will propagate from all four corners and not from the bottom corners alone because the top is also supported	train
audio_0_127247.wav	So, ma this will make the situation worse the system will immediately rail at the supply voltage, it could rail either direction depending on the initial offset, right	train
audio_0_108031.wav	1 is a fairly good assumption to work with, you might not get something more than that	train
audio_0_159109.wav	the answer is we can proceed and do it and we will show how to do it without adding the artificial variable, provided the problem has an optimum solution	train
audio_0_122198.wav	So, you become the end of line system designer and even though the customer therefore, is performing some of the functions earlier performed by employees of Dells computers, earlier computers	train
audio_0_117335.wav	And if A is equal to D this term will get cancel this term will get cancel so that means, S 11 is equal to S 22	train
audio_0_117494.wav	So, if this will be shortened then the impedance seen at this end will be the parallel combination of R C and R L which is represented by a small r c	train
audio_0_152961.wav	So, other than this because there is a point here when t approaches to 0 so other than that, there is no issue about the piecewise continuity of this quotient here which is we have denoted by g t, but the question is that when t approaches to 0, this limit may not exist that means the limit t approaches to 0 plus this f t over t may not exist	train
audio_0_144242.wav	so you understand that this is very, very important	train
audio_0_159154.wav	and thirty six by five, six is smaller	train
audio_0_110972.wav	So, now what we have done over here	train
audio_0_110342.wav	So, now for this particular case we can write the voltage equation and current equation and you have to remember basically that we have to write V 1 and I 1 on one side and V 2 and I 2 on the other side	train
audio_0_147620.wav	suppose we have a friend in our school	train
audio_0_141651.wav	efficiency: efficiency in the case a transmission line output by output plus losses, output is four thousand five hundred kilo watt	train
audio_0_12373.wav	And this V V 0 actually that is something like a nodal analysis it is nodal analysis	train
audio_0_16079.wav	And I will be V Thevenin because it has been asked to find out current through 10 ohm resistance 10 ohm resistance	train
audio_0_161024.wav	because it has to go to one out of these four people, if all of them reduce the corresponding cost by one unit, it will still go to the same person because all of them had reduced it by one unit	train
audio_0_120083.wav	And so therefore, almost every service business is somewhat fragmented or there are constant competitive pressure to fragment slight taking slices away from the current market structure from your current market position, so people are chipping, chipping	train
audio_0_115778.wav	So, that is the principle of phased array antenna	train
audio_0_266.wav	And if you compute the eigenvector there and since now you want maximization which means you have to consider the maximum eigen value vector corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue	train
audio_0_19416.wav	Now the question is if one of the product lines is to be closed temporarily, which product line should be closed	train
audio_0_126346.wav	So, in the next class, in the next class we will see quickly the data sheet of the operational amplifier	train
audio_0_15402.wav	Now, if you do so, if you do so, resistance R 2 can be replaced by inserting an additional resistance R 2 dash in the primary circuit such that the power absorbed in R 2 dash when carrying current your is equal to that in R 2 due to the secondary current, right	train
audio_0_21286.wav	So, in the next lecture we shall be taking it from this point onwards where this thermal resistance value will be utilized, but we shall be considering the neutron flux to be varying	train
audio_0_135118.wav	similarly, if you go for your v two f, you calculate, you will get point four one six nine per six, nine per unit, because in the case of v two f, it will be e g two zero minus v two f divided by again the same thing, right you will get is equal to i two f	train
audio_0_125830.wav	When we connect the passive high pass filter to the non inverting unity amplifier, then we get active high pass filter	train
audio_0_14931.wav	So, look how things are it will be 5 plus j 5 i 1 plus i 2 right, then here if you will come it will be 5 plus j 5 i 2 right; this voltage will come later	train
audio_0_101414.wav	So, what you see is so the repetition is corresponds to the cycle number and what you see is the path by which it follows in the stress strain curve when you exert when you stretch it and when you relax it is different and also the average slopes of these lines keeps on increasing with the increasing passage of cycle number	train
audio_0_132438.wav	All that is required is just to find the offset in the fast bin pick out the 1st memory chunk that is present and do a small link list operation	train
audio_0_15669.wav	Similarly, another current is also leaving because we have taken in this direction	train
audio_0_151607.wav	So here, we have to check at all these points, whether it is a minus pi or it is 1 or it is 2 or pi, that the limit should exist	train

audio_0_160230.wav	initially we will write the dual as a minimization problem	train
audio_0_130425.wav	Because my VDG is equals to V T the channel width will become narrow, and this will happen near the drain and you can see here the channel width near the drain will become narrower when this becomes narrower; that means, that my volt my current is kind of the rig is constant my current rig is like constant right And this particular voltage is called pinch off voltage	train
audio_0_173558.wav	So, how to see which, see which one is the best one	train
audio_0_118457.wav	When this signal passes through the hybrid at this point, both this signals will be shifted by 90 degree in phase	train

audio_0_125964.wav	So, when we have to use operational amplifier, the first thing that we have to do is apply the biasing voltage, this biasing voltage is given by the DC power supply	train
audio_0_3770.wav	So, direction is downwards and this i 1 direction is downwards and this is going upwards	train
audio_0_122702.wav	So, you create an alternate mechanism, which you can touch and feel and read and understand is that you create a whole series of documentation, you give reputation oriented referral documentation, give testimonial of people who have already earlier use the service and felt good	train
audio_0_1494.wav	And then you can compute the distances or similarities between them	train
audio_0_173659.wav	Another one is scoring function right what is the meaning of scoring function what information you can get from scoring function	train
audio_0_130866.wav	So whenever there is a keystroke that is whenever a user presses a key for example let us say he is pressing a key with respect to his password, each keystroke results in an interrupt the interrupt results in a switch to kernel mode, there is an ISR that gets executed and so on	train
audio_0_160525.wav	the first demand point constraint will be x one, one plus x two, one plus x three, one greater than or equal to thirty	train
audio_0_172727.wav	So, this contains atoms, any record which contains atom and this is the ‘and’ condition, fifth column starts with A	train
audio_0_2130.wav	So, this this location is is modulated by different shapes of patterns through which these lights are projected so those will be visible on the surface of the visible means those can be detected	train
audio_0_147355.wav	so we have two very careful in each and every aspect of communication, whatever we are speaking: understanding the situation, understanding the context and understanding the mood of that person at that particular moment, if we are really interested that our communications should be effective	train
audio_0_2911.wav	So, field current if is equal to 230 upon R f, 230 is supply 230 is the R f, so 230 by 230 is 1 ampere	train
audio_0_113780.wav	You can see it is between 0	train
audio_0_123936.wav	That was the idea that at least at least some of the parameters on the datasheet, when you open the datasheet you will be able to know	train
audio_0_157936.wav	When I am actually turning it on, the switch is turned on, V in, whatever is the input voltage that is coming across the inductors	train
audio_0_123431.wav	If I keep VDS 2 minus VDS1 fixed, then for increase in lambda error again increases, then if my lambda increases error again increases	train
audio_0_116342.wav	Now, put this value in this equation	train
audio_0_126760.wav	And when you do this one you can have the sensor	train
audio_0_4026.wav	If it is a delta, if the source is delta connected right, now look into that in this case there is no new term	train
audio_0_101974.wav	So, increasing the number of filaments will lead to increase in the number of you know number of contacting filaments also, but beyond a stall force you see there is a sharp drop	train
audio_0_141133.wav	m v a base right, that is i b, is equal to base current	train
audio_0_158090.wav	I am going to have essentially a switch here which is in series and then I am going to have a diode, then I am going to have an inductance, a capacitance and the load	train
audio_0_125825.wav	This is first order high pass filter or it is also called one pole filter	train
audio_0_105018.wav	So, you put a press on your sample while scanning and that is what the deflection set point is	train
audio_0_107319.wav	Again we are talking of a material which is not strong in tension	train
audio_0_155697.wav	So, tee was lossless and reciprocal but not matched at all ports	train
audio_0_102016.wav	So, then this entire thing will turn red in this case also you cannot see individual monomer level polymerization or de polymerization events	train
audio_0_101337.wav	So, to answer this question Valerie Weaver, decided a number of experiments on breast cancer invasion and the relationship between extracellular matrix stiffness and malignancy	train
audio_0_166180.wav	So, let us look at particularly in the swap example again	train
audio_0_169107.wav	We have looked at polymorphic dispatch mechanism and we have used it extensively in designing a solution of staff salary processing	train
audio_0_4240.wav	So, the induced emf E in a coil if you have N turns is given / E = minus N d∅/dt	train
audio_0_123510.wav	So, we will also see lot of experiments as a part of this course	train
audio_0_127171.wav	When CMRR is equal to 10 raised to 5, what is the answer	train
audio_0_3494.wav	Whenever we have given that your what you call that sinusoidal and phasor and that emf equation were the beginning of the single phase circuit the same philosophy right	train
audio_0_129789.wav	And as soon as we meet in the next class	train
audio_0_114039.wav	Now, when gamma out is greater than 1, that means, now output impedance of the device has negative resistance	train
audio_0_156951.wav	So, I would see that if I look at the current on the AC side, on the AC side, if I try to look at the current, I am going to get exactly the current whatever I have got in the load exactly being reproduced as it is until the positive half cycle	train
audio_0_16972.wav	Just I am trying to make it this part, right	train
audio_0_141757.wav	this is your, what you call efficiency, right	train
audio_0_4094.wav	Similarly for here, so that means that for a balanced star connected load say Z 1 is equal to Z 2 is equal to Z 3 is equal to Z Y that is Z star right, we call Z Y	train
audio_0_124483.wav	I just wanted to take a part where you can understand how the thermal oxide is grown	train
audio_0_157436.wav	I'm just saying 110 because I'm assuming that 110, maybe I would have already gotten 200 volts or 205 volts	train
audio_0_150050.wav	Okay, getting to the new problem now, we need to find now the Laplace transform of the functions, the exponential type, then that means we have e power at e power i a t and e power minus i a t or we can have also e power minus a t	train
audio_0_125694.wav	So, let us solve it	train
audio_0_163236.wav	This will get resolved here	train
audio_0_16088.wav	So, in this case what will happen that 2 ohm resistance is taken off	train
audio_0_169929.wav	They just behave like the global functions only, but being friend they can access directly the private data members, so here, if we now have this particular function	train
audio_0_140012.wav	then distance from here to here, this conductor is also two r, and distance from here to here, these two conductors, it will be two root, two r, because this is two r, this is two r	train
audio_0_109237.wav	So, I'm just examining couple of them, the Eurocode format, which is of course based on a different approach in terms of design with respect to the IS code	train
audio_0_113072.wav	So, come to this particular point	train
audio_0_110857.wav	So, there will be a lot of attenuation because of these capacitor	train
audio_0_15187.wav	Now, next example the power input to the rotor of a 440 volt, 50 hertz 60 pole, 6 pole, your 3 phase induction motor is 80 kilo watt	train
audio_0_160627.wav	now, having obtained a feasible solution, the next thing that we ask is: how good is this feasible solution	train
audio_0_111818.wav	And this way, you can realize the axial mode helical antenna	train
audio_0_146382.wav	these decisions are again things which are based distinctively upon our attitudes, values or ideologies, their ideals, guiding principles	train
audio_0_12870.wav	So, all this, whatever I said whatever I said all this things are written here for your understanding right	train
audio_0_165842.wav	Let us understand what we mean by the static and dynamic type of objects	train
audio_0_127609.wav	And how the CMRR can be very high	train
audio_0_2669.wav	So, average time for each patient to arrive is 12 minutes; that is, lambda	train
audio_0_166783.wav	That an object may be considered to have five different execution stages because first for the object to exist there has to be a memory, which has to get allocated somehow, either on the stack automatically or in the global common area statically or in the heap dynamically	train
audio_0_1656.wav	So in this case it has been shown 2 cross 2 in this particular diagram for typical examples and for each grid of cells you get the histogram	train
audio_0_113102.wav	45 actually all this thing will be at the outer of the circle	train
audio_0_24968.wav	Then teacher’s instruction for books off the bag, maybe this is not, yeah, he gets to know that it is not going to be a free class, yeah	train
audio_0_112973.wav	Now, read the imaginary value which is minus j 1	train
audio_0_131275.wav	Further, as many of you would know smart cards and other such low end devices can be easily cloned or copied, So, this means that I could actually clone this particular hardware, create another hardware which has exactly the same private key	train
audio_0_173217.wav	So, we have this is may be you, this is your sibling, brother, sister so on	train
audio_0_161515.wav	so if i have a greater than or equal to constraint in the maximization primal, the corresponding variable will be less than or equal to type	train
audio_0_157596.wav	So, inductance drop is 0, LDI by D T, in this particular case definitely will be 0 because the return current is a constant current ID, okay	train
audio_0_110780.wav	So, just recall this point here corresponds to NF min which is equal to 2 dB	train
audio_0_165835.wav	In fact, we talked at length in the last module about various casting options, particularly when casting is done on a class hierarchy; and we observed that if we up cast from a specialized class to a generalized class then that are valid operation	train
audio_0_165653.wav	Now, that is where we get into severe problems	train
audio_0_121616.wav	Because one can find a customer requirement, one can fine tune once process and see that this gap is made	train
audio_0_25279.wav	So this is basically c bar transpose y bar k	train
audio_0_130505.wav	Now, what I had to do	train
audio_0_18264.wav	It can be production costs, admin costs, marketing costs, selling cost, R&D costs and so on	train
audio_0_107587.wav	Keep this in mind both at the unit level and at the level of the masonry assembly	train
audio_0_154368.wav	There is also a source kind of associated with it	train
audio_0_110653.wav	Let us say the RF signal centre at 4	train
audio_0_122894.wav	cCalculate central resonant frequency f R is this, right	train
audio_0_26627.wav	This is parameter vector, H bar and therefore, H bar is, let us say it is an M dimensional vector H1, H2, up to HM Which is basically a stacking or collection of M scaler parameter	train
audio_0_162409.wav	So, this two has a representation which is an integer representation, which typically is a single field representation where you use some kind of a particular way to show the signed numbers	train
audio_0_18895.wav	Now for your simplicity, we have made a small working note here	train
audio_0_161048.wav	the last column has changed to one: zero, zero and one	train
audio_0_11541.wav	So, all these things are shown here it is 10 ohm it j 8 ohm and it is your minus your j X E	train
audio_0_2920.wav	And this is 230 ohm; that means field current your what you call I f 230 upon 231 ampere	train
audio_0_143999.wav	there are different ways to motivate the individual	train
audio_0_171175.wav	In this case, you can give the value as any point y in the fraction y you can give as this is the fraction for the folded state and here is a fraction for the unfolded state y equal to y f into fF plus yu into fU	train
audio_0_170035.wav	But the movement we come to C++ several solutions look different, the initialization etcetera become constructor and destructor	train
audio_0_109406.wav	So, this is the width of the bedded motor, 30 plus 30 that we are going to be considering in the calculations	train
audio_0_119571.wav	There are nowadays some information and communication technology intensive services which have some kind of barrier	train
audio_0_116980.wav	So, one segment will consist of this another segment will consist of this line and the third segment will consist of this line here, as I mentioned divided and solve the problem	train
audio_0_136384.wav	so primary distribution system means it will be thirty three kv or eleven kv	train
audio_0_17053.wav	i infinity plus i 0 minus i infinity e to the power minus t by tau	train
audio_0_21104.wav	So, in the first modules itself we have learned; how to calculate this amount of energy once we know the mass of all this components involved, but a in the second modules we learned that a while there are several nucleus which can undergo spontaneous radioactive decay	train
audio_0_15670.wav	So, another current it is also leaving that is v 2 minus v 3 divided by 4 right so; that means, v 1 minus v 2 upon 8 there is current is entering is equal to v 2 upon 6 plus v 2 minus v 3 upon 4 that show later	train
audio_0_120831.wav	this gives you number of different these are two level or bidirectional service supply relationship are networks like for example, service category mind customer supply patient, so the patient is disturbed there is some kind of mental acne	train
audio_0_105853.wav	So, you are basically making an estimate of the weight of the structure that will participate in developing inertial forces	train
audio_0_154897.wav	So, these are the 2 paths that we have and in the loop is defined as a, as a path which starts and ends at the same point	train
audio_0_127584.wav	So, then we have 1	train
audio_0_155918.wav	Now, how do we analyse this circuit	train
audio_0_104396.wav	So, you can have for all these collagen receptors you can have alpha 1 beta 1	train
audio_0_167687.wav	So, that is basic thing that we want to do understand here	train
audio_0_125752.wav	This region is your triode region; once you saturate current saturates because the channel is pinched off	train
audio_0_150052.wav	So, having this 0 to infinity, e power minus s minus a t so we have combined the two, the two exponent here with dt and that will be that can be integrated now	train
audio_0_140452.wav	it has been ask that your base voltage is two thirty volt, them in this side	train
audio_0_172569.wav	So, already I am having the output file for the grid	train
audio_0_25454.wav	so the Gaussianness remains invariant under affined transformation	train
audio_0_105916.wav	So that is the first and probably the foremost reason why increase in permissible stresses is allowed	train
audio_0_154967.wav	In the previous module we had discussed about scattering parameters and we saw that they are related to the power transmission in a network that is then voltages and currents	train
audio_0_19295.wav	In this particular course we are going to focus on cost and management accounting	train
audio_0_139697.wav	so not very difficult one, just you have to understand little bit and all these things are we have tried to explain, right	train
audio_0_129551.wav	Now this physical body position are sometimes called vacuum deposition	train
audio_0_158169.wav	So if RI happens to be higher at this point where it is supposed to switch over from D1 to D2, if by chance RI happens to be higher I am definitely going to have probably the D2 that other one will not be taking over completely	train
audio_0_21678.wav	I had a lot of fun putting these videos together for you	train
audio_0_144273.wav	but it is also important to identify the lost component, ah, which may or may not get very reflected but which i have a feeling would take you a long way, where you are making presentations in your absence or where a you are extending your soft skills to other areas, such as, let say, a party which you are giving, or may be an inaugural program, or may be a particular, let say a, how do you put it	train
audio_0_27189.wav	Now let us look at another function, which is termed as the quadratic form, and this is given as follows	train
audio_0_3443.wav	So, maximum power output can then be found corresponding to the slip define by equation 42; however, this condition correspond to very low efficiency and very large current and is well beyond the normal operating region of the motor	train
audio_0_172367.wav	So, then we get the 50 percent of maximal inhibition right why is IC50 we mentioned	train
audio_0_15733.wav	we know we now we now relate the power and energy to voltage and current, because we have to relate now power and energy to the voltage as well as the current	train
audio_0_29277.wav	so this particular standard helps in communicating between these systems, connecting, rather connecting between these different systems and the business processes of that particular business	train
audio_0_166647.wav	They are no more in use, but some compiler still continue to allow them because they were written before all these changes were done in the C++ standard	train
audio_0_112268.wav	So, if you try to recall, what is micro strip antenna	train
audio_0_126618.wav	So, in this case the power required let us say this is 2 this is 1; the power required for 1 will be higher than power required for 2	train
audio_0_171853.wav	So, you can see this is one window and this is with a command prompt, we can use any command right in this space and execute the program	train
audio_0_130410.wav	So, case one we have considered when VDS equals to 0 volt	train
audio_0_153095.wav	So, we need to find L inverse of s minus 1 over s square plus 1 which again the linearity says that this is L inverse of s over s square plus 1 minus L inverse 1 over s square plus 1	train
audio_0_12940.wav	So, you can easily make out that how things are	train
audio_0_104624.wav	So, the spacing decreases; if I were to draw the spacing as you go ahead your spacing decreases as a function of distance you are spacing decreases	train
audio_0_128208.wav	This is a wedding card	train
audio_0_14836.wav	So, plus just see this	train
audio_0_171275.wav	So, this is a folded state unfolded state multiply then we get the values	train
audio_0_136188.wav	thats why it is two point four, six plus j	train
audio_0_126458.wav	But this time we will take an another example so that you guys understand how we can fabricate finally a MOSFET	train
audio_0_2628.wav	So, all these, we see in biology also	train
audio_0_111477.wav	So, we know that patch capacitance provides capacitance from the top substrate to the ground plane	train
audio_0_112643.wav	It can be even a DC voltage	train
audio_0_132073.wav	c code, find out the address, find out the line new node is call that is line number 19 and we put a breakpoint at line number nineteen like this and run the code using R	train
audio_0_115353.wav	This is how the phase noise measurements can be done using a spectrum analyzer	train
audio_0_118823.wav	Now, you see it has created a arc circular arc	train
audio_0_125952.wav	We will see how the voltage at the output changes when we go or when we when we pass the cut off frequency fc	train
audio_0_127636.wav	Gain is 1; so, we to have make the gain equal to 1, we have Avo voltage gain equal to 1; the closed loop gain is unity regardless of the source or the load	train
audio_0_159177.wav	i have shown a lot of iterations here	train
audio_0_22452.wav	Then we already have few existing products like a Google Classroom or a Wiki which can do this kind of, which have similar kind of functionality as well	train
audio_0_111977.wav	Today, we are going to talk about different types of transmission line such as co axial line, strip line, micro strip line and rectangular wave guide, you have already heard about different modes in the parallel plane or in the wave guide so, but today, we will focus upon the practical aspects of these transmission lines	train
audio_0_158783.wav	we put a plus one here, so this becomes minus one, this becomes plus one and this becomes minus one	train
audio_0_138637.wav	so this is that zero sequence diagram for delta, delta	train
audio_0_143473.wav	so particularly particularly for long transmission, high voltage, long transmission line, you have to consider the charging capacitance	train
audio_0_154437.wav	I said, the noise figure of a passive device that is one which attenuates the signal is same as the attenuation	train
audio_0_110246.wav	And now since we have assumed that part of the wall section is going to be cracked and part is uncracked, we are interested in looking at what is the compressive length of the width of the compressed zone because you can use only the width of the compressed zone in your equilibrium equations	train
audio_0_1.wav	In the previous lecture we discussed the form of a general project of camera	train
audio_0_125001.wav	He has just if you look extremely complicated, but it is not complicated, guys	train
audio_0_23928.wav	Hello and welcome back to this phase of design thinking	train
audio_0_158011.wav	the same three components, four components that we talked about, a switch, an inductor, a capacitor, a diode, right, all these things	train
audio_0_160831.wav	i also write the objective function value of these variables: ten, nine, zero and zero above this variables: ten nine, zero and zero above the variables	train
audio_0_116454.wav	And, field is uniform for TM 1 0 mode field is uniform along the width	train
audio_0_171676.wav	So, we know the values	train
audio_0_163419.wav	So, the objective of this module would be to understand operator overloading	train
audio_0_119339.wav	Payment elements, card payment, cash payment, options, mix of the two or sometimes when you are placing the order, beforehand just for pickup and bring home delivery	train
audio_0_107242.wav	Of course, we are not yet discussing the behaviour of such structures under lateral action	train
audio_0_118903.wav	So, you can see it is below 10 dB in all the frequency range from 0	train
audio_0_172974.wav	SVM a support recommendations right this I will explain soon, and Naïve Bayes and k nearest neighbours, k means clustering, random forest right, artificial neural networks and so on	train
audio_0_114834.wav	So, now let us just look at the next part which is history of microwave engineering	train
audio_0_154616.wav	And then A 2 this incident at port 2 they way that is incident at port 2 as I describe while we are is actually the reflect can also be considered to be reflected from the load	train
audio_0_173476.wav	So, for the global alignment here gaps are also counted and here you can see we ignore the gaps and then see only the other regions right for local alignment	train
audio_0_110942.wav	Let us take of unilateral case, my in this situation S 1 2 is equal to 0, that is how unilateral is defined that signal is only going in one direction there is a no signal going in the opposite direction that means, S 1 2 is equal to 0	train
audio_0_24720.wav	And hence the opposite of that, my corollary to that would be if they are nearby, then my revenue is high	train
audio_0_127448.wav	So, you see this is an amplifier this is amplifier, it is nothing, but unity gain amplifier	train
audio_0_150450.wav	So, as we are going far away from that point the accuracy is not at all good but in the close neighborhood of that point the accuracy is very good	train
audio_0_18835.wav	Then, €10,000 is the amount of share allotment may be received in the month of March	train
audio_0_158602.wav	now we also observe from this solution, interestingly, that the person x three is actually not cyclic	train
audio_0_13912.wav	5 i 0 ; so, this current entering also 0	train
audio_0_27171.wav	So x hat k equals C bar	train
audio_0_15937.wav	That is 4 into 10 to the power minus second you substitute here t is equal to 4 your millisecond, then you will get p is equal to 48 cos square whatever its comes inside you will get p is equal to 4	train
audio_0_137110.wav	so once you substitute all this values and this, all this z elements will come from this previously computed one, from here only	train
audio_0_130511.wav	So, again if you want to understand quickly what we have done; what we have done here that we have drawn the ID versus VDS plot	train
audio_0_108872.wav	The other aspect is you are seeing a situation where in one block in one of the cavities one reinforcement bar is placed	train
audio_0_163044.wav	So, naturally the first parameters still continues to be size t which is the total number of bytes that need to be allocated which can be computed here from this type and as well as the number of elements	train
audio_0_149948.wav	So, another example where we have the integrant with some of the two functions z e power Pi z and then z 4 minus 16, then we have here z and e power Pi z, then d z there and c is a circle with ellipse, which is x square plus this y square by 9 equal to 1 in the standard form	train
audio_0_19641.wav	But in our given example, just for us to understand, you would have got as to controllable means something which can be controlled by the department, by improving the efficiency	train
audio_0_169518.wav	Now, functions get their parameters by a mechanism, which is known as call by value	train
audio_0_130715.wav	So, we can use this stack for the purpose of this transfer of this parameters	train
audio_0_168051.wav	So, destructor must be declared virtual in the base class always	train
audio_0_125685.wav	If we know, what it is, how the plot for I D versus V D S looks like for different value of V G S, it is very easy to plot I D versus V G S	train
audio_0_13617.wav	Now, Voltage , from this point to this point right, this is given your 50 Volt right, this is your 50 Volt , that is your V 4 , this is your given 50 Volt	train
audio_0_156030.wav	And so suppose this point, where the this value of frequency for which the input the gamma N modulus is equal to gamma M, I call that electrical angle theta M	train
audio_0_132809.wav	To understand how differential power analysis attacks actually work, we will take a very small circuit as shown over here	train
audio_0_21766.wav	I do carry my diary with me most of the time and so I jot things down in points	train
audio_0_152540.wav	So, this is a very good approximation if four digits are considered 0	train
audio_0_151547.wav	But in this case, for example, we have the problem at these points there but then it will converge the Fourier series to the middle one, so to the 0, to the average value	train
audio_0_130804.wav	Now what we do is some arbitrary malloc we invoke here and invoke function 1, so note that so now note that the GOT entry for function 1 is used to determine the address or the location of function 1	train
audio_0_107019.wav	So, you do a water retention test and then you carry out the flow table test again after carrying out the water, after removing the water from the motor and you expect that the flow after the water is removed, flow after suction as a percentage of the flow before suction is about 80% or 90%	train
audio_0_106169.wav	So, how is the post peak behavior beyond C to E or beyond D to F will really depend on how much pre compression is there and therefore it will affect the frictional resistance	train
audio_0_112100.wav	So, epsilon effective will be given by this particular expression, what this expression tells here that now epsilon effective will be average of the 2 medium	train

audio_0_167965.wav	In the earlier in module 1 we have talked about source organization, where he said that all functions header must be prototype must be in headers files, dot h files function bodies implementation should be in separate dot CPP files, but for inline functions this is not possible because when an application sees the function prototype unless it can see the body how does it inline, how does it replace the body	train
audio_0_172456.wav	Then the next step is feature selection this is very important, because what are the features you select in your model that will give you the reliability of your model because if you choose wrong features right then you can reproduce the data, but in you go with the real test set or the new data in this case your method will fail	train
audio_0_119375.wav	Important thing here is that, the core of providing food and beverage can be very well done by many restaurants	train

audio_0_162847.wav	She has to put their definitions on top and she finds that, both of them use the same function name	train
audio_0_134348.wav	One of the most common vulnerabilities with respect to printf is an insufficient arguments are passed to printf for example in this particular statement over here the format string specifies 3 format specifiers as seen over here however we have passing only 2 arguments, so what happens when we execute this program is that corresponding to each of these format specifiers printf would look at the variable arguments on the stack using the ap pointer and print the corresponding value	train
audio_0_155084.wav	And for example, an SMA transition, the SMA launcher is shaped like this and its equivalent circuit is like a lowpass filter, pie implement of a lowpass filter	train
audio_0_165151.wav	So, if these 2 have to be same then this has to be same as ampersand s	train
audio_0_171523.wav	So, we get these contact maps and we compare how far the contacts maps are similar	train
audio_0_123199.wav	So, we cannot have the characteristics that we really want in an operational amplifier	train
audio_0_163387.wav	So, perhaps this shown here, this is one typical error message from a compiler showing you that here it is saying it takes the first function that is when you tries to compile, the second function when tries to look into that, it says that is why it is talking about the second function which this double return type says overloaded function differs only by return type	train

audio_0_113788.wav	5 dBi, assuming 1 dB loss	train
audio_0_12409.wav	So, the this is open circuit, so no current is flowing through this 4 ohm resistance, because this is open and therefore, you apply your what you call that KVL in this mesh	train
audio_0_153342.wav	So, if this result implies this h t equal to 0 identically here also we are getting the same result that means this u power s naught and the h the function of this minus ln u will be equal to 0	train
audio_0_105321.wav	If you are using concrete blocks, the chances are that the grout material that you are using is close enough to the concrete blocks composition, but it still could be different	train

audio_0_156471.wav	Now what are the significances of these 3 types of waves	train
audio_0_148997.wav	so the moment the problem comes, we quickly move in that direction to solve it	train
audio_0_168832.wav	A class which does not have any super class or parent is necessarily the base class and the root class, but classes like who exist in the middle could be derived class for one part of the inheritance and base class for the other part of the inheritance, and we could really have variety of different complex and hybrid kind of inheritance structure that we would like to encode and understand in C++	train
audio_0_167877.wav	So, you keep on waiting till its value becomes 100 and it is possible that at some point it become 100 and then that a particular condition becomes false and the function will be able to return	train
audio_0_21295.wav	We discussed about the global and national energy scenarios through some projections and stats and thereby started tried to establish the importance of nuclear power in context of the present day energy demand and also considering the depleting reserve of fossil fuels and then, we also discussed a bit about the historical development of a nuclear power	train
audio_0_115199.wav	So, we need to focus at this particular point	train
audio_0_124157.wav	I will go slowly, so that you do not get, you know lost in understanding the process flow	train
audio_0_103452.wav	So, to recap what we have discussed is just a brief background of how to characterize properties of solids and fluids, and with that background we will now try to understand; what are the aspects of a ECM network, which makes it behave like a solid or a fluid or something in between	train
audio_0_168714.wav	We have learnt about the methods, which can be defined for a class and invoked for an object	train
audio_0_121914.wav	And as you can immediately see that, why this is quite quantitative and quite deterministic, this cost aspect that this value thing has both monitory and non monitory aspects	train
audio_0_147516.wav	on the other hand, in the indian cultural context, when a men or women who dont know one another are general conversing and we find that the distance is the greatest, it's roughly two and half feet or roughly thirty inches, at which they are more or less comfortable talking to one another	train
audio_0_137589.wav	main advantage of this method is that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution is independent of the size of the your problem and computationally it is very fast	train
audio_0_108111.wav	So, to interpret the gap as something that reduces the height of the arts that is available is the physical representation of the gap datching mechanism itself	train
audio_0_15488.wav	So, R 1 is given R 2 is given, X 1 is given X 2 X 2 is given	train
audio_0_128844.wav	So, you see this is the IC	train
audio_0_2216.wav	So, is below here	train
audio_0_125582.wav	And then because of the positive voltage at the gate, the electrons will get attracted from the base and there will be formation of channel	train
audio_0_161800.wav	so what we do now is we observed that if we had a positive slack variable, a slacked variable with a plus one coefficient, then we could have started with that	train
audio_0_17871.wav	They are into two product lines, P and Q	train
audio_0_115818.wav	So, if you actually look at the plot of this particular thing which can be done using bode plot	train
audio_0_17090.wav	So, V 0 also one can your this voltage across this one it can be obtained your from nodal analysis	train
audio_0_104956.wav	Now what has been observed is in the clinic MDX patients are often given this drug called prednisone	train
audio_0_14673.wav	So, there are many 1 or 2, I am making that like if it is 10 to the power 18 it call exa it is symbol is capital E, you know this is 10 to the power 15 you call peta it is capital is your what capital P, we call 10 to the power 12 you call tera it is T, then 10 to the power 9 right	train
audio_0_137827.wav	but ah, your what you call this ah, but you have, you have got they, your what you call got some ideas that how to solve load flows using ah in in gauss seidel method for considering you have in bar a buses are pq bus or buses and bus	train
audio_0_138515.wav	similarly, when you come to this one, this one and this one, same	train
audio_0_165964.wav	This is defined as virtual and this is another h is also defined as non virtual	train
audio_0_4232.wav	So, primary winding is connected to AC supply I told you and secondary winding may be connected to a load	train
audio_0_106589.wav	The eye section spans across the room and then the eye section itself is used for seating the arch and construction of the arch	train
audio_0_145706.wav	the second point i want to make was about visual are supplements	train
audio_0_100683.wav	So, we will briefly touch upon these cytoskeletal filaments and their dynamics later in the course	train
audio_0_25596.wav	the downlink channel is estimated at the mobile	train
audio_0_126571.wav	If that is the case let us see what are the gas sensors or gas sensors is a device which exposed to get species, which on exposed one arm or which one exposure to gaseous species or molecules alters one or more of its physical properties	train
audio_0_108980.wav	Therefore, FS will dictate what is the corresponding allowable masonry compressive stress	train
audio_0_25781.wav	Right, The update equation	train
audio_0_24107.wav	Next what we need are prototypes	train
audio_0_11965.wav	And this is this time period is T say 0 to T and this is your this time is T by 2 right	train
audio_0_117232.wav	Now, let just take an example	train
audio_0_24775.wav	So that is as far as the persona is concerned, the second that we saw the last time was the phases that we tracked them	train
audio_0_167208.wav	So, we can see among the two most commonly used, two most powerful containers in C have two different ways of access; array since all elements are of uniform type	train
audio_0_115531.wav	So, half power beamwidth can be now determined from this particular plot and that will be 30 degree and 30 degree	train
audio_0_131985.wav	So the expensive ways would look something like this where we would have a laser so we would place the device which the attacker is interested in the laser and fire laser at this specific device	train
audio_0_155739.wav	The S parameter matrix of this Wilkinson power divider can be given by this equation	train

audio_0_173005.wav	For example, if I put a line here right here what is the average error	train
audio_0_137237.wav	now you have to compute that schedule value, right	train
audio_0_11651.wav	And the phase difference between voltage and current I told you alpha minus beta here the power factor your cos alpha minus beta right	train
audio_0_23117.wav	I have actually covered it on time	train
audio_0_102286.wav	And he showed that, in tub you can see that wherever you put the pipette next to this you see growth of focal adhesions	train
audio_0_17757.wav	Now this data will be useful for making projections	train
audio_0_150876.wav	So we have 2 s square and that 2 will get cancel then with this when we take the common here 2 so we get still 2 s square and minus 8	train
audio_0_151552.wav	Then it is our wish to write down the cosine series or we call it half range cosine series, where f x can be represented by purely in terms of the cosine functions, where the an is given by 2 over L and 0 to L f x cos n pi x over L	train
audio_0_158780.wav	now let us look at a solution which is given here: thirty ten, twenty five, five and thirty	train
audio_0_24527.wav	To this and creating a kind of relationship with what he has already learned what he is presently learning	train
audio_0_149512.wav	So, these values here now instead of this 1, 1, 1, we will use these values in the next iteration, so for y for instance this will be used, for z this will be used and then we will get the new value after the next iteration for x	train
audio_0_141749.wav	so v s is equal to this one twenty seven plus this one	train
audio_0_158735.wav	this could be the optimum solution	train
audio_0_133897.wav	Now since we have reordered these inputs from A B C to A C B this state machine will never reach its final state and therefore the trigger will never get activated and therefore the payload will be non functional	train
audio_0_25800.wav	Okay, Complex gain at time N plus one equal to four	train
audio_0_154726.wav	This was a low pass prototype and this is our bandstop prototype	train
audio_0_138999.wav	but these are the dummy parameter	train
audio_0_155941.wav	Say you have a coupler which is symmetric, so you might say that we have 16 parameters in a coupler because it is a 4 port network and we found out S11, S 21, S 31 and S 41, then how come I can find out all the other parameters	train
audio_0_139127.wav	also, you have a minimum and maximum value and line power flow, right, line, because every, every line conductor, a transmission line conductor, has its maximum power carrying capability or maximum current carrying capability, they they call thermal limit	train
audio_0_128099.wav	Aluminum, Gold, Platinum, Copper etc	train
audio_0_25735.wav	during this example, Im going to illustrate how to extend the framework of sequential estimation to a complex parameter and that is going to be fairly simple, alright	train

audio_0_128288.wav	What they are showing whether they are showing a thermal sensor, where you can see a person in night	train
audio_0_159035.wav	so again we use the same example to illustrate, so that we can have a better understanding of linear programming, because we have seen this example so many times already and we will continue to see it for some more time	train
audio_0_107685.wav	So, with an appreciation of what R factor should you use, we then go and define depending on the zone we are sitting in what the design seismic coefficient is	train
audio_0_141604.wav	but if you look at the generator side, generator side, this is isolate	train
audio_0_21256.wav	So, minus k d T d x at x is equal to a should be equal to the total amount of heat flux that is getting transmitted through that phase, here we have use the Fourier's law of heat conduction and the heat flux just that is coming out through one of the phases	train
audio_0_122716.wav	But, for most people, we will use images, we will use metaphors, we will use expressions to counter the intangibility or mental impalpability or the abstractness	train
audio_0_3688.wav	Similarly here the lower side is additive, because it is anticlockwise and upper side is subtractive	train

audio_0_170269.wav	I could have simply set this to p because it is all in the domain of all in the same name space of the mobile phone class	train
audio_0_156533.wav	So now if we apply the KirchoffÕs current law now this is very small element which we are assuming can be divided no further, this element if we apply KirchoffÕs current and voltage laws then we get equations like this	train
audio_0_17364.wav	In B part, now school has decided to take a few students from municipal school at a concessional fee so that they would be charged enough fee just to cover the incremental cost	train
audio_0_164598.wav	And that is one of the reasons possibly that even though Q sort is available in the C standard library as a default sorting algorithm, the use of Q sort has not been that popular in the C community	train
audio_0_16230.wav	So, basically Thevenin’s Norton transformation or Norton Thevenin’s transformation right source transformation is so	train

audio_0_164448.wav	Those are the basic type traits that both the function template as well as the class template will need to follow	train
audio_0_162595.wav	And as I said the destruction order is just the opposite	train
audio_0_25397.wav	so the universe is simply the inverse of each of the diagonal elements, that is, that is, the reciprocal of each of the diagonal elements: 1 over 1 plus j, 1 over 1 minus j, 1 over 1 plus 2 j, 1 over 2 minus j, which is basically multiplied with your output vector containing the samples received across the subcarriers, that is Y bar	train

audio_0_124217.wav	That is required to manufacture a silicon wafer	train
audio_0_163744.wav	The reason is simply, because here when we write the macro, it basically compares the value of the pointers not the string that are pointed to by those pointers	train
audio_0_128356.wav	Let us see the first one which is the frequency and period	train
audio_0_167873.wav	Because if the value of i is a 0 and then I am checking if i is 100 and i will continue as long as i is not hundred suddenly the value of i will never become 100	train
audio_0_109953.wav	However, we are examining an idealized case where the wall is free on the lateral edges and is subjected to itself weight and there is superimposed gravity for gravity loads and there is lateral load acting on the wall	train

audio_0_100690.wav	So, the staining that you observe here, the staining of focal adhesions which is so crispier, is achieved by actually treating the cells with light, permeabalizing the cell lightly to remove all the cytoplasmic pool of the cells the cytoplasmic pool of proteins focal adhesion proteins and then what it remains is these proteins which are in which constitute the insoluble fraction and which are actively recruited at focal adhesions within these cells	train
audio_0_15386.wav	So, suppose it resistance that you load resistance is R L and say reactance is X L j is not put any have, but when you solve the problem you have to put j the complex operator and voltage across the load is V 2 it is given here, right	train
audio_0_125424.wav	Then we have seen the voltage using the variac and we have also seen the frequency, we have seen the frequency	train
audio_0_143758.wav	we have an phase which tells us seeing is believing	train
audio_0_19897.wav	Since we are in the budgeting, company would expect you to calculate total as well	train

audio_0_103742.wav	So, F actin filaments are formed by polymerization of G actin and the ability to form filaments actually determined is dictated by the concentration of G actin	train
audio_0_28436.wav	And therefore now one can also use this approximation so q or square root of N, by 2 less than or equal to point 00005	train
audio_0_166713.wav	So, if you look into the table below where, whatever I am saying is written down here in the table below	train
audio_0_12273.wav	So, take one example	train
audio_0_170715.wav	nλ equal to	train
audio_0_168946.wav	So, what the compiler does is, if the user provides a constructor it will use that constructor, but if the user does not provide a constructor for a class then the compiler will supply a free default constructor	train
audio_0_143336.wav	now, real part: alpha is known as attenuation constant and the imaginary beta is known as the phase constant and beta is measured in radian per unit length	train
audio_0_111326.wav	And, frequency error is quite low which is plus minus 0	train
audio_0_23664.wav	Now what they come up in the interviews is they might not be accessible to all the content at all times especially when they are sitting inside a classroom	train
audio_0_170458.wav	So, it is very simple just to give the id, but there are several issues; if your PDB id or sequence does not have sufficient number of homologous sequences you will you do not get any results it will tell you cannot calculate the conservation, but in the case of AL2CO you know that how many sequences you get depending upon the sequences if you give, you will get the results that is the difference between using different servers	train
audio_0_21132.wav	And therefore, that is every neutron is surrounded either by moderator nuclei or fuel nuclei	train

audio_0_124354.wav	When we perform wet etching or dry etching, the silicon will get etched	train
audio_0_167602.wav	So, where I take… so you can do write the whole logic that will you need to construct an A object from the B object, and put it down here	train
audio_0_153949.wav	So, to come back we need to move in a clockwise direction once again but then we need to go downwards	train
audio_0_122734.wav	The visualization I talked about it earlier, at that time I called it a flow chart, I will now use some other terminologies in this connection like terminology blue print or process map	train
audio_0_108805.wav	So, what's happening is the masonry wall should actually be overturning, but you have a confining element and that confining element is going to increase the compression at the compressed toe	train

audio_0_103266.wav	So, what laser ablation does is it focuses laser light at a single point on a stress fiber	train
audio_0_11225.wav	Then you have to find out calculate the power loss, and you have to show the phasor diagram right	train
audio_0_170176.wav	So that ensures that no employee instance can be constructed which gives us comfort because we do not know what would it have meant to construct an instance of an employee because we do not have any details about that	train
audio_0_114077.wav	So, you can see that this angle is exactly same as that of angle of gamma out	train
audio_0_126730.wav	So, it is a lot of process	train
audio_0_130332.wav	It means a channel is not there	train
audio_0_128659.wav	So, we have also seen the input bias current, right	train
audio_0_150219.wav	This curve integral the value will change if we take instead of anticlockwise if we go for clockwise directions, here also this unit normal	train
audio_0_125518.wav	And hence the mythe capacitor holds a peak input value until the input signal again attains a value greater than V cVc, right; that means, initially if V iVi is greater than V cVc, capacitor will start charging	train
audio_0_104213.wav	What they found was, so similar to that exhibited on similar to maximum branching on the softest surfaces	train
audio_0_103939.wav	Now, the flow profile I discussed about suggests that leader cells, these leader cells do not originate from the initial border, but may get transferred from the second or third layer inside	train
audio_0_1042.wav	So first you compute the plane induced homography among themselves	train
audio_0_134268.wav	We first start of it is in how this particular Trusted Execution Environments is different from confinement	train
audio_0_131463.wav	And, at this particular point we look at the contents of the stack	train
audio_0_127590.wav	, wWe have seen active low pass, we have seen active passive low pass, we have seen active high pass, we have seen passive high pass in this thing we have covered	train
audio_0_126087.wav	And you have applied voltage at the non inverting terminal one volt peak to peak	train
audio_0_132596.wav	So, we run this tutorial 2, give it this malicious input, which is input vm and we see that the value in GLB is 3628800, this essentially is the value for 10 factorial are which you can actually verify	train
audio_0_141254.wav	so this flux linkage formula will be used again and again	train
audio_0_168001.wav	Since, data is private here the overridden print function in D we cannot actually access data	train

audio_0_136370.wav	next one is that if we, if we look into that schematic diagram of power system, right, if we look into that schematic diagram of power system	train
audio_0_150713.wav	So, then we have discussed the classification and the first was what is the removable singularity, so using the Laurent series we have observed that if the principal part of the Laurent series has no term then we call it as removable singularity, the second using the limit we have discussed and their we discussed that if this limit here exist finitely then also we call it as removable singularity	train
audio_0_105052.wav	So, what you do is you fit these curves to various models	train
audio_0_14995.wav	Because at the at the start this part is 0; that means, ultimately affecting impedance is getting reduced because of that starting current is higher because this part is 0 right	train
audio_0_158782.wav	now we apply the same idea: if this is not the optimum solution, then putting a plus one in an unallocated position should give us a gain	train
audio_0_25946.wav	And in the next module we are let us we will look at a simple example to basically solidify this concept, sort of make this even more clear	train
audio_0_115284.wav	So, the basic quantities which are measured in RF and microwave circuits are frequency, power impedance, port parameters which are S parameters and noise	train

audio_0_102119.wav	In adhesion to this if you think of the other physical cues, this kind of cell shapes for example star or flower you can engineer these shapes, but these shapes do not naturally occur inside out in vivo context	train
audio_0_4504.wav	So this way, this way if you look into this the this one right [ ] so this phi r F2 which is with respect each other creates the torque tending to move the rotor in the direction of Fr the if that induction motor is therefore, a self starting device right	train
audio_0_106812.wav	Failure occurs when the tensile strength in flexure of the edge fibers are reached and you get failure under flexual tension of the unit itself	train

audio_0_134489.wav	However, in practice implementing this type of design has got significant performance over heads, this is due to the fact that we have one process per user and if you have a large number of users connecting to the web server the number of process would increase many folds and therefore the performance will degrade	train
audio_0_152393.wav	Or every time we are narrowing down the interval that means we are getting better approximation for the root because this condition makes sure that the root lies between this end points of the new interval	train
audio_0_15257.wav	So, A, we know phi m is equal to A into flux density, right	train
audio_0_3270.wav	So, it will be your what you call that inefficient in the sense first thing is your S into P G, if S is high that is copper loss S is high then copper loss will be more right	train
audio_0_126180.wav	One thing that you can see on this last slide also and every time I will try to bring one quote from some famous guy who has done something good in his life, right	train

audio_0_14916.wav	So, this is actually i 2 this is taken like this right suppose it is leaving the dot	train
audio_0_145343.wav	but very often in other parts of the country people confuse that where you say you node your head in this way to say yes and this way to say no, and this is something which doesn't exist in that particular tradition	train
audio_0_120524.wav	Because, this customer life time value, which is, so important to us that long term relationship is only possible when you have a good give and take, give and take based matching of your objectives organizational objectives and customer values or customer gains customer rewards	train

audio_0_719.wav	This is another data point	train
audio_0_3538.wav	Because so many segments are there so many such half cycles are there, so there, but it is DC, but it is DC right	train
audio_0_11767.wav	So, here also 710 watt you will get the same result	train
audio_0_166298.wav	So, this behavior if you look at then this behavior is already very clear to you	train
audio_0_21670.wav	Only computer can open that	train

audio_0_154409.wav	F is equal to 1 for 0 noise power added that is when a network is perfectly noiseless, contributes absolutely 0 noise	train
audio_0_159687.wav	the important thing here, off course, is the pivot has to be negative	train
audio_0_110648.wav	Go to elements, go to measuring devices controls and so drag this, see the component NL noise	train
audio_0_167244.wav	So, what you get as d data is completely wrong	train
audio_0_101824.wav	So, first of all not only were these cells nuclei were elongated, but you have these odd shaped nuclei and the segregation of lamin A and B	train
audio_0_102974.wav	Also, you have this phenomenon called Contact Inhibition and in this phenomena you have cell division ceases when cells contact each other	train
audio_0_101623.wav	This is demonstrated sorry it is 2000 demonstrated durotaxis, this is a 2000 again BiophysJ sorry this is Journal of Biomechanics	train
audio_0_121769.wav	So, that is why positioning is very closely allied to segmentation, market segmentation, customer identification, deeply understanding the persona, the behaviour of customers and creating an unassailable attractive package of value propositions for them	train
audio_0_152946.wav	And the result will be s to infinity F u du that means when we divide by this t we have to basically integrate this Laplace transform of f and this result is valid for all s greater than alpha, alpha was the exponential order of f there	train
audio_0_121548.wav	Who are you serving today	train
audio_0_103201.wav	So, using this once you get the bead displacement then, you can use theory of linear elasticity to find out what is the force distribution	train
audio_0_20256.wav	A maximum of 13 million Curie amount of radioactivity gases released to the surrounding	train
audio_0_169261.wav	There is one virtual function f and one virtual function g	train
audio_0_158324.wav	now, at the moment, let us assume that we have not solved this problem, or we right now do not have a way to solve this problem, but we are interested in finding out what would be the upper estimate of the objective function without actually solving it	train
audio_0_24602.wav	So I think we have done successfully finished of 2 personas, I am very happy with the results that these guys have delivered on the second persona of this particular activity that we did of the customer journey map	train
audio_0_172277.wav	This is a kind of ligand based approach	train
audio_0_3335.wav	So, this is the reactance x m into this I so; that means, into v divided by r 1 plus j x 1 plus x m right that is why V Thevenin right this is why V Thevenin	train
audio_0_125894.wav	So, he has this breadboard, now as usual, first of all we have to generate this signal, and we also have to apply the bias voltage to the op amp	train
audio_0_102864.wav	So, you know that 4 times unstructured length plus partially folded length into 0	train
audio_0_119440.wav	But companies like Microsoft has gained enormously by sharing the problems and they have been able to identify flaws and bugs in their software for more faster by sharing, by involving the lead users in the software development	train
audio_0_136936.wav	so as soon as it is coming from here, so that we mechanical input power will be greater than during fault, greater than this electrical power, because this point b is below point a	train
audio_0_146878.wav	colours can be classified as one colours, cool colours and ah	train
audio_0_170452.wav	So, here it is easy to do that we do not have to give any sequences if the structure is known right you can give the just the PDB id if we give the identifier of the protein databank I will discuss about the protein databank in later classes right	train
audio_0_157053.wav	And charging station these days will take at least currently it will take six to eight hours to charge a battery	train
audio_0_115601.wav	So, how do we find the value of delta well	train
audio_0_163170.wav	For example, I can convert character to integer, enum to integer, bool to integer	train
audio_0_106207.wav	So, this is an empirical estimate	train
audio_0_165540.wav	Particularly if it is a user defined object type the reason you would like to pass it as a reference because then you do not need to copy that exception object you can just keep on propagating	train
audio_0_128256.wav	Why integrated circuit is important	train
audio_0_16941.wav	2 millijoule	train
audio_0_168238.wav	So, that is used to distinguish between the prefix operators which is this one and the post fix operator, because both of these by name are plus plus	train
audio_0_118847.wav	Now, just define x here this angle inside cos, it take it as radians	train
audio_0_169487.wav	And, it is typical that it gives you a value at the end of computation; we say it returns a result	train
audio_0_158512.wav	so, first row: again, the penalty is one	train
audio_0_163049.wav	Let us look at the first line here we are using the operator new function we could have used malloc also, but we are using operator new function to allocate the required amount of space which is waste in this case, and we get that as a void star pointer and then using that pointer and using this setv parameter we actually fill up that buffer with the setv value	train
audio_0_1256.wav	And when it intersects with the image plane, then the intersecting line, two planes planes they intersect at a line so that intersecting line is a vanishing line that is a geometric interpretation of vanishing line and it is related with the plane so it is vanishing line with respect to this plane so this is a interpretation so from this we can compute also the normal of the plane because if you know the vanishing line then I can compute the corresponding plane itself by using that same transformation p transpose l and that would give me the normal to the direction of the plane for which this line is a vanishing line and if it it is a reference camera, that means if the camera is represented by this projection matrix k into i 0, that is a projection matrix of this camera	train
audio_0_108436.wav	So, now you have this expression, the expression for the lateral load in terms of the geometry of the wall and the you have it in terms of x and with shifting locations of the eccentric of the reaction you can then get different points on the force displacement curve	train
audio_0_155896.wav	So, from the E plane tee, basically what we got was S 41 is equal to S 31 which is equal to 1 upon square root of 2, so this is from the E plane tee	train
audio_0_161215.wav	so let us try to write down some feasible solutions and calculate the value of the objective function	train
audio_0_10740.wav	So, it is a valid circuit connection there, even voltage source is there, one dependent current sources	train
audio_0_124954.wav	So, we have a operational amplifier here, right	train
audio_0_170671.wav	Then coordinate structures they provide the combination of the secondary tertiary structures having different sub units to give tertiary structures	train
audio_0_10045.wav	So, whatever it comes it is 61	train
audio_0_12788.wav	Now, come to i 2 0 plus	train
audio_0_168289.wav	When will the constructor use operator new when you have some dynamically allocable pointer members	train
audio_0_111816.wav	So, from there you can calculate the value of d	train
audio_0_152761.wav	So, the projection if we have to see that again it will be a rectangular shape because we have already seen one of the previous example, we have the circular, we have the cylinder there and if it is projected on the y z plane, it is going to be a rectangle here	train
audio_0_15038.wav	01 that is your no load slip, so n 0 will be 99 rpm	train
audio_0_142262.wav	so in that case the total real power loss is given by k is equal to one to nbr	train
audio_0_148895.wav	now this is the concept which differentiates intelligence from certain other attributes, ah, from analytical skills of the mind to other skills of the mind which are equally important	train
audio_0_128282.wav	And it is a very very famous saying by Swami Vivekanand, Arise, Awake and Stop not, until your goal is reached	train
audio_0_150185.wav	So, we have already discussed the Green’s theorem in previous lectures	train
audio_0_162325.wav	If you have a unary operator, you know unary operators are of two types, one are prefix operators which happen before the operand, that is this kind of; these are all prefix operator or they can be of the post fix type	train
audio_0_168621.wav	So, these are different examples, where you can see that we show that the basic components of a class that is a class as a class keyword, it has a name which is the name and identifier, it has a number of data members	train
audio_0_103798.wav	So, and you want to answer that under what circumstances would you get convex f v curves versus concave f v curves	train
audio_0_102453.wav	In terms of intensity what they found if the outside is plus plus plus, the inside is plus, and the bottom is plus plus	train
audio_0_152023.wav	And this s U x here we have the derivative with respect to x	train
audio_0_125593.wav	We are applying V D S, where drain is more positive compared to source	train
audio_0_116333.wav	So, conducting boundary is at x is equal to 0 and x is equal to a and the tangential fields are E y and E z	train
audio_0_121066.wav	So, normally you actually as you develop the relationship as you have a longer term relationship, you move the customer to a higher tier of service level	train
audio_0_151432.wav	We could also get the cosine series	train
audio_0_155147.wav	It has to be open	train
audio_0_167998.wav	And certainly since now the object is about to be destroyed; it had a dynamic allocation in the ptr pointer, so that allocation will have to be released	train
audio_0_156814.wav	Now suppose again we have our Smith Chart if I use a different color for this Smith ChartÉso this is my Smith Chart and say I have an impedance say IÕll write the value also	train
audio_0_101391.wav	In the next class, we will continue from this part	train
audio_0_117227.wav	So, just to give you an example here, we have taken here let say j equal to 1 and k equal to 2	train
audio_0_142839.wav	suppose if we put like this: say v a is reference phasor, so v b lags from v a here by one twenty degree and v c lags from v a by two forty degree or otherwise, v c leads v a by one twenty degree	train
audio_0_159759.wav	the optimality criterion theorem also means something very similar, but the optimality criterion theorem looks at it from a different angle	train
audio_0_124046.wav	We will start from computers, how you think that the chip is used within the computers, think about it	train
audio_0_171506.wav	018, compare with the contact order long range and multiple contact index you can see the number is in which order decreasing order, why is decreasing order	train
audio_0_131119.wav	So, what we will see now is the actual code and a demonstration of the attack	train
audio_0_138865.wav	what we are doing is v r is equal to v	train
audio_0_154386.wav	Now let us see what does the term, noise figure mean	train
audio_0_151486.wav	So, with the sine we have the cosine term, here also we have cosine term and then, so this was the integral and then we have to put the limits 0 to L, so which comes out to be such an expression which can be simplified to get these values of an	train
audio_0_124399.wav	This can be done from 100 to 400 degree centigrade	train
audio_0_166541.wav	And the most prescribed and more commonly used style is you identify one of them, one of the different options of inheritance is a hierarchy that you are getting take identify one of them which is dominant and put a single multi level and you know are kind of a hierarchy on that	train
audio_0_13381.wav	So, it will be sin omega t plus phi, because voltage is leading the current	train
audio_0_122306.wav	Of course, usually in many of these instances which you see on this side of the diagram, the high side of the diagram, the high contact may also denote high content; that means multi layered content	train
audio_0_106098.wav	So, that would complete the design checks that you make for a given wall itself	train
audio_0_136344.wav	so p i minus j q i upon v i conjugate minus k is equal to one two n capital y i, k, v, k, k not is equal to i, right	train
audio_0_169911.wav	With this certainly the problem gets solved three separate overloading solves the whole problem, but we know that since we are using global function we have all the new answers of breaking the encapsulation and that is not a very good preposition	train
audio_0_135014.wav	and the problem consists of determining bus voltage and line current during faults, right	train
audio_0_172496.wav	And here we require a protein as well as ligand in the example we use the protein Abl kinase and the ligand Imatinib	train
audio_0_124244.wav	So, that is the idea	train
audio_0_150076.wav	So, after this integration, we have e power minus s t over minus s limit t to infinity and again the same situation	train
audio_0_136222.wav	that is their old base m v a and this is the new hundred m v a hundred is the new base m v a	train
audio_0_156041.wav	Now the way usually these designs happen is that you are given a value of gamma N from which you find out the value of theta M and from which you can find put the fractional band width	train
audio_0_10320.wav	This exercise you do it finding out your what you call that rather than low voltage side full load current you will find out that your what you call a high voltage side full load current	train
audio_0_2870.wav	So, this is your separately excited your what you call DC motor, and V is the terminal voltage, and your E b is the back emf	train
audio_0_171642.wav	So, you can do the same way and then you can calculate rigidity	train
audio_0_140799.wav	that means q c, that capacitor thing	train
audio_0_142234.wav	now, when capacitor is connected across the load, that combined power factor you have got cos delta r dash is equal to point nine, two, three, eight, right, this one, you have got it	train
audio_0_141303.wav	it is volt ampere base for this transformer right now and this is the your, what you call ah	train
audio_0_172112.wav	Then we discussed about amphipathicity like; what is amphipathicity	train
audio_0_123019.wav	He is going to apply to the input of the breadboard	train
audio_0_150427.wav	Because this theorem says that for any given function which is continuous, we can find a polynomial with as good accuracy as we want	train
audio_0_133041.wav	So, by the running the command like objdump disassemble all hello and saving the output in this file called hello dot list, we would be able to get the complete disassembly for the Elf executable	train
audio_0_155710.wav	So, we saw this for passive devices Gamma L is always has a magnitude less than 1 that means the resistance is negative, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient will be greater than 1	train
audio_0_112862.wav	Now, till now you might be more familiar with only 1 gain; you know output voltage divided by input voltage or output power divided by input power	train
audio_0_104533.wav	So, if I put something in between which is very stiff, the cell which is sitting here might be able to sense what is sitting here or down there	train
audio_0_159555.wav	now, when we apply this procedure and we see if we actually had a zero here instead of this one, allocating into that zero is going to take away the chance of doing this and doing this	train
audio_0_166705.wav	There is something in between, which we do not care	train
audio_0_26671.wav	So let us consider the transmission of pilot vectors, and in fact there will be multiple such vectors	train
audio_0_101157.wav	So, there is an increase in lamin A expression, now along this if you also plot how collagen levels scale with tissue stiffness	train
audio_0_26599.wav	So the log likelihood function, that is, if you will now look at again, traversing exactly the same steps as we have done before, the log likelihood function, observe, log of log, like you would function of the observation parameterised by the parameter vector H bar, is nothing but the natural logarithm of the likelihood function of that is P Y bar, H bar	train
audio_0_101703.wav	So, after you have done the PDMS what you want to do is on a new substrate you want to invert your PDMS, after coating it on a given with a given ligand	train
audio_0_123032.wav	So, three operation amplifier we have, we have six resistors, we have two capacitors, we have we have bias voltages, we have input signals, we have output signals	train
audio_0_172487.wav	To the expected threshold is randomly default value is 10, but you can change right then the word size where you want to split the query sequence into 3 words or 4 or 5	train
audio_0_2319.wav	So, there is why documenting process is very, very important in this particular case ok	train
audio_0_151842.wav	So, we have e power minus s t over minus s which is already there 1 over s, and then we can put the upper limit and then the lower limit	train
audio_0_110697.wav	Hello and welcome to second lecture on Low Noise Amplifiers	train
audio_0_141208.wav	so total inductance is called loop inductance	train
audio_0_16647.wav	We see later	train
audio_0_133753.wav	So, first when gadget 1 executes the stack pointer is incremented to point to this and the contents of edx register would be address, after pop gets executed the stack pointer is pointing to G2	train
audio_0_158036.wav	That is it	train
audio_0_127220.wav	So, the infinite gain would be useless except in the self regulated negative feedback	train
audio_0_135389.wav	so again repeat, the delta m is nothing but delta two	train
audio_0_112741.wav	So, what it really means is that if amplifier is only I am sending signal in this direction and not sending any signal over here	train
audio_0_164999.wav	So, up casting is safe	train
audio_0_159851.wav	but at the moment, if there are two zeros, we temporarily not make an assignment and proceed	train
audio_0_23137.wav	Of course there are several other ideas that can keep coming up	train
audio_0_169356.wav	So, b type object may have this much it actually has only the base part of it	train
audio_0_165703.wav	I am back here	train
audio_0_25966.wav	That is, we take a few symbols from the tail of the block and prefix them at the head of the block	train
audio_0_893.wav	And its task is that it converts an image point to a line which is an epipolar line and sometimes they are called also this relationship is also called correlation	train
audio_0_149011.wav	so it apparently the idea looked ridiculous at right at the beginning	train
audio_0_135323.wav	integration will be delta one to delta two and it will be the integration of the p e minus p i d delta is equal to area b c	train
audio_0_127564.wav	Llet us go further, let us make 130; 130 still same, let us make 150 still same, let us increase it to 160	train
audio_0_134630.wav	Therefore, the attacker would not be able to specify where the subversion should occur and to which location should the return be present, on other words the attacker will find it difficult to actually identify the address at which the payload would be present	train
audio_0_153005.wav	This derivative theorem we have some remarks now that if f t is not continuous at t equal to 0 for instance, because this continuity we assume then we have taken here f 0	train
audio_0_109834.wav	We'll continue with the lecture on the shear strength under the consideration of gravity forces in the masonry, we were looking at establishing a set of expressions that for different levels of axial compression give us a failure surface in terms of shear mechanisms	train
audio_0_153178.wav	This is the first component with i similarly, we will have with the j and then with the k	train
audio_0_20567.wav	Now, in all the discussions related to the neutron nucleus interaction that we had so far	train
audio_0_158563.wav	so buy hundred and seventy new napkins on the first day and then keep the solver solution	train
audio_0_171525.wav	First, we set the subset of the residues they have the hexapeptides cut into different pieces and then see how these hexapeptides matches	train
audio_0_150118.wav	So, this is a very useful result which can be used for evaluation of a polynomial and many other functions wherever t power n appears	train
audio_0_110694.wav	However, as I mentioned this is not the final configuration; in the next slide I will show you what is the final configuration	train
audio_0_10267.wav	So, when will find the efficiency right, output is V 2 dash I 2 dash cos phi by phi 2 right	train
audio_0_18614.wav	So, they have to recover 55 lakhs plus make profit of 2 lakhs	train
audio_0_169381.wav	So, that is about the dynamic cast which can cast your pointers on a polymorphic hierarchy at the run time	train
audio_0_137009.wav	one must be equal to a two and this is the maximum clearing angle	train
audio_0_24082.wav	So first we find out	train
audio_0_164322.wav	That is a reason just look at the result very carefully this gets printed b object value 0 gets printed from this cout, which is correct because I created object b with the value of data which is 0; clear enough	train
audio_0_163868.wav	So, this is a variable, this is another variable	train
audio_0_1550.wav	And in this particular so any query image suppose you have a you have a query say 10 minus 3 and we would like to get the nearest neighbor from this query	train
audio_0_152506.wav	So, if this gx is continuous that is very natural condition we have here in some interval this a to b and that contains the root	train
audio_0_161471.wav	now from here we introduce an unrestricted variable, so the number of variables reduce by one	train
audio_0_149621.wav	So, if this epsilon goes to 0 and this 1 over epsilon in that case will tend to infinity naturally and that is exactly the function which we will define here as Dirac Delta function	train
audio_0_23521.wav	Right you get this graph	train
audio_0_24617.wav	Now there is a chain of Whys that you can construct, build so that it all forms a logical, a connected logical Reasoning to that	train
audio_0_124453.wav	That means, it will affect the processing of silicon	train
audio_0_101646.wav	So, these kinds of shapes cannot be controlled in culture instead the shape is of course, will dynamic in nature	train
audio_0_167386.wav	And template gives you another kind of polymorphism because that is a template polymorphism, because here again you have a single form of a function written in terms of the template of the function or single form of a class, but you can use it for variety of different purposes	train
audio_0_165631.wav	So, what I want to do is basically take this and copy to the T l member and that is what is written here	train
audio_0_109550.wav	So, let's keep that in mind and use this as a basis for the formulations	train
audio_0_21970.wav	Shubam, just a few questions on writing and how you learn and everything	train

audio_0_150606.wav	The function will become this infinity, so it is not defined as such so there is no point of analyticity, at all other points the function is analytic and therefore, we, the definition of this singular point is satisfied and all these points are singular point, because in the neighbourhood of these points the function is analytic, only at this point the function is not analytic, and therefore these are the isolated singularities of this function	train
audio_0_152290.wav	So, I will not go into the details	train
audio_0_24487.wav	Relevant chapter or topic, right	train

audio_0_119759.wav	But, what we are saying today is that in the service encountered stage in the high contact service, there is a higher level of need for knowledge flow from the service provider to the service consumer, quality information flow from the provider to the consumer and it has to be at right points of time	train
audio_0_100226.wav	But the drawback, there are several drawbacks of bottom up test estimation such as it may overlook many of the system level costs	train
audio_0_163917.wav	So, this is just to highlight through a simple example that the order of the data member can be critical and while writing the initialization list, you should be aware of the order in which the data members are actually created	train

audio_0_4588.wav	Now also E1 by E2 if you this expression this this expression if you make, here it is written that this expression you make it E1 by E2 you just divide E1 by E2 then it will be like this	train
audio_0_158178.wav	So if I fire T1 here 120 degrees away from this I have to fire T2 for symmetry because VAN, VBN and VCN are phase shifted from each other by 120 degrees	train
audio_0_130749.wav	So, if the number of suppose for example, when these see the number of push is say 4 and number of POP’s is three; that means, the situation is like this is that when you are calling a subroutine you know that first if a first the return address is saved on to the stack	train
audio_0_167123.wav	So, we say str 1 plus str 2, so this is pretty much like I have a variable x having value 3, have a variable y having value 5	train
audio_0_124345.wav	The first thing that we see is that in the IC industry Integrated Circuit industry	train
audio_0_22473.wav	So now it is no longer dependent on the school infrastructure, it is only dependent on whether students have the required infrastructure at home to access this particular application	train
audio_0_110090.wav	So, if you have slender wall, flexual mechanism with low pre compression can undergo overturning of flexual rocking, otherwise you can see the failure of the compressed toe itself	train

audio_0_113916.wav	So, gain of the parabolic dish antenna is given by pi d by lambda square multiplied by epsilon ap, this expression I had given in the earlier lectures	train
audio_0_26193.wav	And now what I am going to do is, from this factor over here, I am going to add and subtract x square of N plus 1, so that basically, you can see what I am going to do now	train
audio_0_131589.wav	I would not go to into the details of this particular flaw, but you could actually look it up on Wikipedia and so on to see a roughly in the mid 90s, how a flaw in the floating point unit of Intel processors had led to a vulnerability where, when you do a floating point operation, the result would be incorrect	train
audio_0_170412.wav	So, just for the verification I put the unweighted frequency and the entropic based method	train
audio_0_122892.wav	Now, we know the formula for resonant frequency, we know the formula for resonant frequency	train
audio_0_112128.wav	899 and then we find W by d which is given by this particular thing and here we can see w by t is less than 2 ; so, hence this particular formula is valid	train
audio_0_27473.wav	So, basically, your x is a diagonal matrix	train
audio_0_18373.wav	So, in CVP analysis we look at the total cost, divide it into fixed and variable, we look at the total revenue, then we look at the desired profit vis a vis various levels of sales volume	train
audio_0_103258.wav	In that ways the chopping rate of focal adhesion is going to be higher	train
audio_0_122276.wav	So, that is what we called labor and expertise contract	train
audio_0_154563.wav	So let us continue the discussion for 2 port network soÉ For a 2 port network our S parameter matrix will be something like this	train
audio_0_114642.wav	So, it is required that we design these things properly choose the impedance values carefully , so that we can design a equal power divider	train
audio_0_122704.wav	These are all different types of testimonial that built reputation or we can record different episodes	train
audio_0_100565.wav	So, in this case in this retraction, rear adhesions are broken	train

audio_0_166250.wav	We compute x with adding one with it and then return that so	train
audio_0_14952.wav	So, M is equal to K into root over L 1 L 2	train
audio_0_109943.wav	So, the first mechanism that we can examine and have overall expressions for is a flexure dominated mechanism or in plane flexure dominated mechanism and then we will examine the other two mechanisms which is again the shear sliding mechanism that we saw whether there is a failure in the joint which is a shear dominated behavior and then the formation of the diagonal cracks the X cracking which is again a sheer mechanism rather than a flexual mechanism and in this clearly there is a role of the aspect ratio of the wall and that is something that you must keep in mind there is a role of the aspect ratio of the wall first and there is also the role played by the boundary conditions that exist in the wall whether you have rotations free at the top the wall is cantilevered with respect to its vertical boundary conditions, it is free to rotate at the top or is it restrained against rotations at the top	train
audio_0_107898.wav	So, of course, all this basically leads to identifying whether there is a need to strengthen the structure, need to retrofit the structure	train
audio_0_103203.wav	So, this corresponds to what is called as the force dipole	train

audio_0_25018.wav	We will assemble again for another; So we are going to clear off the desk we will show you what we have done and then probably assemble again and we will do the second persona; because for this case it matters because the journey of writing notes and the dealing with notes does not end here in this scenario, that is why we are going to do a second one	train
audio_0_104468.wav	So, where the green space is lacking the green signal is lacking you see that there are these red dots	train

audio_0_132653.wav	If we evaluate these two instructions in a normal operation what would happen is that due to the raise exception this memory access to the probe array would never occur	train
audio_0_2414.wav	So obviously, you can see that you know it is very complex for an operator to sort of go inside all the way into this region unless really, he has gegh or a gun which can deliver the wax, but there is always a problem that the wax may not be able to sufficiently come and coat the inner surface of this particular door	train
audio_0_118087.wav	So, here is an example where input impedance is given by Z A equal to 20 plus j 30 Ohm and the required parameters are that we want to calculate reflection coefficient and VSWR	train

audio_0_163533.wav	Now, while according to the C program this is a correct thing do, but we feel somewhat uncomfortable because we wanted to remain in the domain of the enum that we have defined	train
audio_0_720.wav	That means for a data point, we can reduce the dimension, we can ignore those components whose eigenvalues are very less	train
audio_0_169557.wav	Here is another example, which is less commonly used	train
audio_0_104424.wav	Similarly this is the starting point A this is the ending point B for this trajectory	train
audio_0_102586.wav	So, because you are only interested in this portion of the curve, the curve is plotted in the following way	train
audio_0_156446.wav	So when we have wave propagation, then we have to come across bending	train
audio_0_18074.wav	Now try to compare the two mixes, X1 and X2	train
audio_0_104951.wav	So, you have a situation in terms of contractility C57 less than MDX less then gamma soarcoglycan deficiency cells	train
audio_0_166748.wav	And, it will also deallocate the stack frame for this function	train
audio_0_172378.wav	So, for this compound the IC 50 value is 12	train

audio_0_161936.wav	no variable is entering	train
audio_0_118061.wav	So, for impedance, it will be constant x, of course here x is positive, here x is negative	train
audio_0_152066.wav	Now, we can apply the initial condition that is u x 0 is 0 so this term will vanish	train
audio_0_165279.wav	And then, look at here, earlier it was returning x	train
audio_0_511.wav	So the circular points, the definition of the circular points are given here As I mentioned that in this representation you need to consider a two dimensional projective space with a complex representation where one of the axis is the imaginary axis, other axis is real axis and there is a scale axis	train
audio_0_118693.wav	However, if you see around 2 gigahertz, the length will be around lambda by 2	train
audio_0_109675.wav	But if it is rigid in plane, when there is lateral action, there wouldn't be any relative displacements in the diaphragm	train
audio_0_158138.wav	So the voltage regulator is supposed to maintain the output voltage as a constant irrespective of any supply voltage variation because understand that this is not 230 volts always although we say it is 230 volts	train
audio_0_19271.wav	So, you would observe estimating is also involved and controlling is also involved	train
audio_0_136160.wav	similarly, for transformer t, two x two, it will be point three, three pr unit	train
audio_0_107967.wav	So, this is a framework that you can use both for load bearing masonry constructions and for infill which are partitioned walls in moment resisting frames	train
audio_0_13513.wav	And next is that your for example, that add the following current as wave as phasor, right	train

audio_0_2071.wav	Active in the sense that here you need to use an energy source apart from the scene for for detecting the for measuring the depth you have to project a ray from a particular source of energy and by illumination you have to consider the computation of the depth so there are three different types of active sensing mechanisms are there one is time of flight sensors the other one is triangulation based sensors and structured light based sensors so let me explain those principles one by one so in a time of light range sensors there is a light source and it's a laser light source usually and you you you project a light or you you transmit a pulsed laser from that point and again the reflection gives you back the corresponding laser signal so by detecting that pulses you can measure the time of flight which is called or the duration of the transmission and reflection of the signal	train
audio_0_10321.wav	And base impedance and try to do it and see now what you get whether you gets identical thing or not right so, this is your this thing	train

audio_0_132785.wav	So, what we see is that depending on the value of Ci, that is the ith bit in C, the power would actually vary, if for instance the value of Ci = 0, then only this particular square operation is performed	train
audio_0_163413.wav	Of course, there are other forms of polymorphism which are typically called dynamic or run type polymorphism which we will discuss after when we get into discussing the object base part of the C++ language	train
audio_0_172165.wav	Since it is very important to construct datasets for any analysis, which are non redundant with each other	train
audio_0_147492.wav	these are things you will become aware of	train
audio_0_111597.wav	Similarly if we put m is greater than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 1, then there will be propagation of the waves	train
audio_0_162737.wav	So, C has a w which is public therefore, this is accessible	train
audio_0_150945.wav	The second possibility would be that we can have the Fourier sine integral which can be written here	train
audio_0_27942.wav	transpose H, H transpose inverse times H	train
audio_0_162876.wav	So, I have a namespace name 1 here and within that I have another namespace	train
audio_0_110299.wav	So, let us first look at what is the definition of the ABCD parameter	train
audio_0_156547.wav	And the current IZ is equal to the difference of 2 waves and the Zo is a constant, it is a constant for a lossless line but for a lossy line, it is equal to this equation	train

audio_0_105374.wav	And then what we do is that we actually place lining on the face of the units and this lining will actually absorb the, will not inhibit the absorption of water by the unit	train
audio_0_120411.wav	But, the introduction of information and communication, technology, integration and introduction of internet has created some big shifts and we will just now see that this more and more informational transactions over the net and not over the physical channel in what way they, it has change the business world	train
audio_0_104219.wav	So, these quantification at early time points	train

audio_0_156519.wav	We have been familiarised with lumped elements at low frequencies where the wavelength is much larger as compared to the dimensions of the circuit but when the dimension of the circuit is comparable to the wavelength of the signal, we can no longer approximate everything with lumped element	train
audio_0_162755.wav	So, that is what I specify here this is just another notation where you using	train
audio_0_160963.wav	so we want to make these allocations in such a way that the total cost of allocation is minimized	train
audio_0_165743.wav	So, that is not what you would want to do	train
audio_0_118853.wav	Then press ok, now you see it has created the geometry	train
audio_0_151349.wav	And this is exactly we should be clear about it, that in this case we have written the Fourier series of this f x is equal to x function	train
audio_0_26545.wav	Alright, So with this we will stop this module and we will explore other aspects in subsequent modules	train
audio_0_133881.wav	So, providing data obfuscation with such non computational hardware units is quite easy all that is required is just an EX OR at the input with some secret data	train
audio_0_129023.wav	And this probe is here so, I will put this multimeter down because right now our function or our application is to measure the temperature	train
audio_0_166205.wav	So, you would not like to incur that cost	train
audio_0_15227.wav	Since the torque is maximum that is the stalling torque right	train
audio_0_130347.wav	Now, for mobile charge carrier is equal to the in mobile ions so; that means, our charge neutrality will be maintained correct	train

audio_0_14055.wav	So, So in this here we have put v 0 is equal to 1 volt	train
audio_0_153596.wav	Okay, so now we go through some examples	train
audio_0_133149.wav	I think hardware is built in such a way that the normal world applications will not be able to access or is totally isolated from the secure world applications and therefore all the sensitive information and secure computations which is done in the secure world is completely isolated and completely independent of the normal world operations	train
audio_0_119125.wav	Then we want that average demand level to be as close to the optimum demand level as possible and we also want to reduce the gap between the optimal level and the maximum level	train

audio_0_114703.wav	So, here the situation is slightly different , we are giving a input here also and we are giving input here also	train
audio_0_103323.wav	So, what you have is when you compress a spring or stretch a spring, you observed instantaneous deformation and till the force is being exerted that deformation remains in place	train
audio_0_141399.wav	actually, when we solved numericals, rather than keeping base in k v a, v a or volt, my suggestion is everything you per base voltage case, you transform it to you cons, a, you converted to kilovolt and whatever may be the base, ah, volt, ampere, all that i have converted to m v a	train
audio_0_101470.wav	But if you take a non linear material no matter what concentration you start from whatever is this initial stiffness you see that the cell spreading does not have any dependents on stiffness	train
audio_0_154792.wav	Now the condition which allows this to do so is the case when z1 & z2 are very close to each other	train
audio_0_164900.wav	So, earlier we were talking about built in types only int, pointer, double and so on	train
audio_0_167533.wav	This will lead to what is known as slicing the object, because what happens is when you try to, here what you are allow to do very freely as an up cast is cast the pointer or cast the reference, but what this person has done is cast the whole object has a whole	train
audio_0_16049.wav	So, if you apply KVL here, it will be look your what you call if I make it like this 40 i 1 right this one and here it is your this current is actually i 1 by 2 because current division is there	train
audio_0_103136.wav	So, n may be variable	train
audio_0_116323.wav	As you can see from this also so at x is equal to 0 E x is maximum and there is no filed component in Z direction, so E z is 0	train
audio_0_126673.wav	After prebaking I will expose the photoresist using a mask	train

audio_0_117146.wav	We also looked into the transmission line what are the abcd parameters of that and then we looked at the cascaded network	train
audio_0_151956.wav	Now each we can use of instance here this x 0 and here we can use y 0	train
audio_0_11968.wav	So, at this point it is i 1 and this is i 2, this is i 3, i 4, i 5 and so on	train
audio_0_100976.wav	So, there is lot of intensity here and then eventually this portion of the cell is collapsing	train
audio_0_101711.wav	So, if this was ligand coated	train
audio_0_164036.wav	Just to recap, on the Introduction of Stack	train
audio_0_101644.wav	So, if you plate cells in culture most of the times the cells will have shapes like this	train
audio_0_164811.wav	So, we will have to use that	train
audio_0_101275.wav	So, as the last step for they did was they tracked chromatin dynamics	train
audio_0_108450.wav	So it is detailed unreinforced masonry	train
audio_0_114864.wav	Just think about if this is 50 ohm and if this is 1 kilo ohm and this part is not there	train
audio_0_152121.wav	And now we can use the boundary conditions that two boundary condition	train
audio_0_117261.wav	Again I want to mention if we say insertion loss insertion loss is minus 20 log of 23 why	train
audio_0_131407.wav	So, in order to do that we use this small script called find payload	train
audio_0_152548.wav	In the first case the g prime was less than 1 and hence the convergence was guaranteed, whereas in the second case the interval containing the root and the initial guess the g prime was greater than 1	train
audio_0_142841.wav	that is beta v a	train
audio_0_130331.wav	Now the basic difference here is that if you see, the drain gate n source these are not connected	train
audio_0_117650.wav	So, in this case this is 33	train
audio_0_107027.wav	The other two mechanisms are shear mechanisms which is based on the diagonal tension failure and then the sliding shear failure	train

audio_0_21012.wav	And it is the proton which it generally determines the chemical properties of any particular nucleus	train
audio_0_113477.wav	Then we also looked at different types of micro strip discontinuities which are open and gap	train
audio_0_166844.wav	I have just done this to illustrate the order in which the destructors will happen	train
audio_0_101073.wav	So, these structures actually protrude into the matrix, invadopodia actually protrude into the matrix and degrade the environment locally	train
audio_0_121074.wav	So, a student customer who is staying here for 4 years, 5 years can bring in a lot of business if the relationship is good and he is not the customer, he is not going away and start using some web based service	train
audio_0_109178.wav	And therefore we need to now transfer from the state of stress to the force resultants especially to define what is the ultimate lateral force capacity of the wall if it were to fail in a diagonal tension criterion	train
audio_0_117456.wav	In this case the operating point is chosen at the cutoff	train
audio_0_151731.wav	So, we have this integral now and we can use this property of the periodic function which says that f tau plus capital T is f tau	train

audio_0_124994.wav	Frequency was one kilohertz, correct	train
audio_0_14267.wav	Now when t is equal to I mean at when switch is open then this part is gone when when t greater than 0 so and switch t is equal to 0 that switch is opened; that means, this part is gone right	train
audio_0_22319.wav	So how can we apply this solve to come up with solutions to bring out this desired result out as what we are going to discuss now	train
audio_0_163619.wav	And this whole paradigm of separating out implementation from the interface separating or protecting the state behind the private visibility and exposing the behavior with the public visibility is known as information hiding in object oriented programming, alternate names follows like encapsulation, state base design and so on	train

audio_0_11635.wav	And this vertical projection this one V dash is equal to V sin alpha	train
audio_0_171388.wav	Then go with the structure diversity for example, if you have the 5 ones; they are similar structures, high scores; then take only 1; for example, 1, 2, 3; so there are similar structure	train
audio_0_143191.wav	that means where v r n l everywhere mod is there	train
audio_0_23083.wav	So now if we look at this plot we have a high learning retention and the pace of teaching is what we are tracking	train
audio_0_127611.wav	We have also seen how can we use the operational amplifier	train
audio_0_23535.wav	So the amount of time for preparation or going through each of these notes actually spikes up, which student usually doesn’t have	train
audio_0_158722.wav	it evaluated three solutions, but it did not evaluate any infeasible solution	train
audio_0_156785.wav	So if go back to our circuit once again we have ZL	train

audio_0_15916.wav	So, it is telling that energy source forces your what you call a constant current of 4 ampere for 6 second to flow through a lamp right	train
audio_0_19190.wav	Now, since actually we have worked for 22 days, there is a requirement to revise that budget	train
audio_0_155474.wav	And what we can obtain is the maximum, specify the input and output reflection coefficients for opening the maximum value of GT	train
audio_0_110282.wav	And therefore you can see that there is H by T that comes into the picture directly	train
audio_0_24874.wav	Yes, I think the tool would be really important Open the notebook and the pen	train
audio_0_133040.wav	So, what we do is we take the hello executable that we have created, and we could actually create the disassemble for that particular executable	train

audio_0_108323.wav	So you now have the condition for which we can expect cracking to form where you have the stress distribution caused by the wind load	train
audio_0_109933.wav	So if you are looking at limit state approach or if you are looking at a performance based approach and if limit states can be designed both for unreinforced masonry and reinforced masonry, this then becomes an interesting criterion, an interesting set of expressions that you could use to define the interaction and I was mentioning the lateral force axial force, lateral force H and the axial force in interaction in masonry walls	train
audio_0_19451.wav	So, Y should not be closed is very clear	train

audio_0_172449.wav	Likewise we do for the different parameters and we use it to remove the vibration right a by a plus b plus c right then if it is more than 50 percent right then you can see they are redundant likewise you need to remove the redundancy for any group of ligands	train
audio_0_111173.wav	Why these people are telling you to reduce exposure to RF energy	train
audio_0_135586.wav	so example three: that an hundred m v a, two pole, fifty hertz generator has a moment of inertia, forty in to ten to the power, three k g meter square	train
audio_0_141440.wav	p one is equal to p three, all are p, then it will basically p into i is equal to one to n ci, right	train
audio_0_154216.wav	Then what happens is that the property of these resonators, that is the devices which create this resonance is such that they have a centre frequency and a certain range of frequencies are about the Centre frequencies where the frequencies can be passed or stopped	train
audio_0_4550.wav	In this case of in that case of squirrel cage motor all these things are not there because rotor itself is shorted	train

audio_0_24691.wav	And his answer was customer visits are few, are fewer than they used to be	train
audio_0_118938.wav	But, soon we understood that network, all these technology based networks were not just another manifestation of channels as we were discussing with examples	train
audio_0_16156.wav	Initially I have written for you	train
audio_0_137849.wav	if you subtract v a, v a will be cancel	train
audio_0_137473.wav	that to some extent that current has two component, right, your, this thing, that is one in real component, another is your reactive component	train
audio_0_133147.wav	So for example you could consider this right so you would have normal world applications and whenever for example you require to do some sensitive operation the processor shifts to the secure world you enter your password which gets authenticated or you enter your OTP or do an encryption which further gets verified and then once it is verified you switch back to the normal world	train
audio_0_112941.wav	So, in the previous lecture we had taken Z L equal to 10 plus j 10 ohm and that we had located that on the smith chart	train
audio_0_144969.wav	so analogies are very, very power	train
audio_0_28314.wav	remember, we can call this the vector y bar k, which is an R cross 1, or basically a 3 cross 1	train
audio_0_19563.wav	It is a budgeted cost which is determined based on the standard costing	train
audio_0_103339.wav	So, compared to the original configuration this is your delta x	train
audio_0_156013.wav	But gamma L will have a maximum value of 1, one which we cannot increase it and uhh, that’s all basically	train
audio_0_143674.wav	it may be a family, it may be the school, it may be the colleges, it may be the community where we live and the members of the class and show up	train

audio_0_113273.wav	You take from here you take go to a diagonally opposite point	train
audio_0_166793.wav	And, the object gets constructed, then the execution continues to the constructor body	train
audio_0_14458.wav	So, E b is decreasing	train
audio_0_133206.wav	So, for example we have privileged code over here could be at Android OS so let us say for example that a network interrupt occurs and a network interrupts are configured to be handle by the normal world	train
audio_0_142453.wav	so twenty one point three, three megawatt cos	train
audio_0_134251.wav	Here with SGX things are slightly bit different whenever there is the IRET instruction that gets executed instead of going back directly to the enclave the function pointed to by this AEP is executed	train
audio_0_106297.wav	5 being a category C building and then we will examine the details under each category at the appropriate time but the point is category B, C, D and E would mean there are specific prescribed interventions, design interventions to ensure seismic resistance	train
audio_0_107332.wav	So, it is a sun dried brick wall that we are examining	train
audio_0_531.wav	And you can note that these two points, I and j, they satisfy this equation	train

audio_0_170778.wav	So, you get the abstract of that particular protein	train
audio_0_102653.wav	So, in the last few lectures I had discussed how rheology of ECM networks has a huge importance in dictating their mechanical properties, and in shipping the overall responses of the cells	train
audio_0_10386.wav	So, therefore, input is equal to output plus loss so, this is my output X P f l right plus losses	train
audio_0_125120.wav	So, AC is alternating current and DC is direct current	train
audio_0_27591.wav	this is a 2 cross 2 matrix	train
audio_0_11841.wav	So, it will be b by 2 that is, it is b by 2 means the radius, right	train
audio_0_172523.wav	So, click on ligand in got to input, open whatsoever we have downloaded the imatinib structure you have to input here	train
audio_0_132877.wav	At the hardware level what people have suggested is that the standard CMOS logic be replaced with other logic which are resistant to these power analysis attacks	train
audio_0_141680.wav	if q greater than zero, it is called lagging load, right	train
audio_0_119521.wav	So, this is actually a cooperative of entrepreneurs and there all culturally very similar, many of them may be you know not graduates, they may be just educated at school level	train
audio_0_12014.wav	So, therefore, the average heating effect is proportional to i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square divided by n right	train
audio_0_10060.wav	And at resonance this imaginary part will be 0 right	train
audio_0_167209.wav	It is accessed by position, it is called the positional access, because you want to find out in the array starting from the beginning the zeroth, first, second, so you just go by number, so array is also called a indexed container, because you can access the elements by number	train
audio_0_148822.wav	let's take an illustration ah this: what coke can be interpreted when you are filtering it through these seven or eight things in different ways	train
audio_0_125308.wav	So, I will give a capacitor to him he will connect it or he will insert it in the breadboard, and then you will see the value of the capacitance on the multimeter	train
audio_0_101058.wav	So, this is just an example showing that this activation is very fast and it need not be at the side of the exhaustion point at which you exert in the force, it might get activated much further	train
audio_0_158621.wav	the simplex algorithm is the most important algorithm to solve linear programming problems	train
audio_0_156391.wav	One way is to simply use the filter with a very broadband and bring this gain down, so that it matches with the gain of this one at this frequency	train
audio_0_13179.wav	So what I said	train
audio_0_115869.wav	So, if we want attenuation at certain desired frequency, then we do not have much choice if you want to use a smaller order filter it is better to use Chebyshev than to use Butterworth filter	train
audio_0_126627.wav	On these interdigitated electrodes I want to have my sensing material	train
audio_0_125299.wav	But let me tell you that we are not interested in understanding the accuracy, right now not resolution, right now we understanding that how we can use the multimeter for measuring different components, all right	train
audio_0_153179.wav	So, if this everything is equal to zero 0, then what will happen that this is possible when the individual terms here are 0	train
audio_0_105500.wav	Beyond that, you have the situation where it could be controlled by compression or could be controlled by the tension with the permissible tensile stress in steel and that part of the interaction curve where beyond the balance section it depending on the state of stress in the wall you would have to either take a compression controlled state or a tension controlled state so that's the portion of the interaction curve where a priori would not know whether tension controls or compression controls, the actual distribution of states of stresses is essential to be able to establish that	train
audio_0_12203.wav	This way I mean this as if this part is 1 winding and this part is 1 winding like a two winding transformer whatever we have studied there	train
audio_0_117260.wav	Now, the question is now, insertion loss and phase delay between ports 2 and 3	train
audio_0_164452.wav	So, with that	train
audio_0_10463.wav	Therefore, V 2 0 minus V 2 upon V 2 the voltage regulation in terms of your percentage that is R e 2 per unit into cos phi 2 plus X e 2 per unit sin phi 2; very simple it is just little bit your practice is necessary	train
audio_0_22703.wav	So would that be, would that, I mean we do not have to throw a feature in there because it is there but is it addressing your basic conflict	train
audio_0_16154.wav	So, V a is equal to 5 into current flowing through i 5 your 5 ohm resistance that is i 5 ohm we are writing, that is 5 into 8	train
audio_0_155855.wav	In fact we get a boundary between the stable and unstable region	train
audio_0_109332.wav	But what is important to recognize as far as working stress method is that there is an unused strength, the strength that the system has, which is not something that we use in the structural system	train
audio_0_14658.wav	So, this is a basic philosophy you have your what you call that is simple circuit is simple dc volt a simple switch wires and your tungsten lamp	train
audio_0_158963.wav	u two, x two are zero	train
audio_0_172846.wav	95, then we introduce a bias because we are using the same feature 2 times	train
audio_0_103684.wav	So, R from capital R to small r or u can integrate from 0 to u then you would get this equation 1 by 4 mu del p del x into R square minus r square	train
audio_0_145814.wav	you can do it online and you will get a score on it	train
audio_0_25828.wav	But basically what weve shown is: weve shown, described this paradigm of sequential estimation, which is very interesting because we dont need to recompute the estimate at every time instant, rather simply update the latest or the previous estimate	train
audio_0_105945.wav	So you have the permissible compressive stress defined, you have the permissible tensile stress defined and the permissible shear stress defined	train
audio_0_137004.wav	your for this graph, this is f and a	train
audio_0_120673.wav	Now, of course, it is not that every where you want this repeat customer, like if a, your healthcare facility and you have successfully dealt with a cardiac patient, you are not really looking for a repeat business from that	train
audio_0_110218.wav	If the crack has to, if the entire height of the wall has to crack, it means a significant amount of the wall has thrust which is acting outside the middle one third of the cross section	train
audio_0_109667.wav	The roof diaphragm, whatever be the roof diaphragm, it could be a steel truss roof, it could be a reinforced concrete flow system, whatever be the roof diaphragm	train

audio_0_167189.wav	And as we go into C++, we will talk more about this that why type def actually is not a type definition, it is kind of a misnomer, but historically it has this keyword has been used, and it continue to be used in C, but it is basically type alias	dev
audio_0_122193.wav	This is done mainly to ensure repeatable standard response from the service system and as I take on examples, you will immediately see why we say that	dev
audio_0_136214.wav	right now, for base voltage of the high voltage side of transformer, t two is v b	dev
audio_0_130914.wav	So, the way we actually extend the attack that we seem to a complete block cipher is as follows	dev
audio_0_131901.wav	So, for example if an attacker tries to modify this data on this bus checks would be done in the processor to identify that the data has been modified and would throw an exception	dev
audio_0_131932.wav	To actually start off with, the modern block ciphers are designed with very strong assumptions so they are infact designed with the assumption that an attacker could know everything about the algorithm except the secret key	dev
audio_0_112578.wav	In the similar way you can use other amplifiers	dev
audio_0_167087.wav	On the left hand side, it is a well known array int arr	dev
audio_0_131667.wav	In the earlier lecture we had looked at Return to Libc attack where the attacker overflows a buffer present in the stack and replaces the return address with one specific function in the Libc library	dev
audio_0_118372.wav	When the v LO is less than 0, we get D 2 on, D 1 off, so the path is v LO, v RF and the IF signal	dev
audio_0_12948.wav	So, if try to convert it to the your what you call dependent current source, same transformation same philosophy here right	dev
audio_0_170869.wav	So, deciphering the native conformation of protein from this amino acid sequence rights this is called protein folding problem	dev
audio_0_137149.wav	so in that case, what you call that, just step by step you have to move but lot of computation is involved	dev
audio_0_106309.wav	So if AH is estimated in this manner, then for this particular categorization, you have to use the shear force for design and the shear force for design is estimated based on differing r factors and this is something that you need to look at which means if I am estimating for such a building sitting in zone two importance factor one which becomes a category B building, one to three story category B building, I am estimating the seismic coefficient and so on for each category	dev
audio_0_119628.wav	So, for example, this is a example taken from airline carriers	dev
audio_0_117553.wav	So, they are tapped in such a way that the input to these transistors are out of phase, So, in this case the NPN transistor we know that the emitter base junction for this transistor should be forward biased in order to start the conduction	dev
audio_0_157520.wav	Both of them are going to overlap with each other at least for a short while	dev
audio_0_14524.wav	Now, it is given n 1 is equal 300 rpm, n 2 is equal to 375 rpm and I a 1 is equal to 15 ampere this is given from which, from these 2 equations from these 2 equations, you can find out I a 2 will be 18	dev
audio_0_13821.wav	So, we have taken a current flowing like this is a clock wise ; that means, the this i is flowing like this flowing like this or you can into the source again this i, this this is ah this i , but for your understanding here it	dev
audio_0_1406.wav	This is a very standard expression of computing curvature for a function of one very one single variable	dev
audio_0_135426.wav	actually, we assume the solution has converged now	dev
audio_0_10802.wav	So, this way you have to understand I hope you have understood this because no other element	dev
audio_0_113185.wav	So, wherever it cuts here that will straightway give us the reflection coefficient value which is the amplitude and the angle can be measured	dev
audio_0_143896.wav	the bhagabat gita is one burning example	dev
audio_0_16184.wav	So, because it is voltage source is in series resistance, there it will be current source in parallel with the resistance	dev
audio_0_169786.wav	Now, let us focus on the second call of the same function	dev
audio_0_131222.wav	On the other hand, if at this point we detect that the canary has indeed changed it would mean that the EX OR value would return something which is non zero and then there would be a call to this particular function called stack check fail	dev
audio_0_16559.wav	So, if you do	dev
audio_0_167314.wav	So, if we can just recall we have taken a look into the const ness of values and variables which is critical in terms of a getting read of manifest constants being able to maintain better type all through the C++	dev
audio_0_158751.wav	and i choose to reduce from this thirty five and if i, and when i reduce from this thirty five, i started from this, i went to this, i went to this, i went to this, i went to this and i came back	dev
audio_0_10180.wav	Now, example 4 in the network shown in figure 3; suppose the load connected across terminal A B consists of a variable resistance R L and a capacitive reactance X C I will show you which is a variable between 2 ohm, and 8 ohm	dev
audio_0_115078.wav	The current is flowing through this in this direction and there will be induced EMF which will be coming through this one here	dev
audio_0_159452.wav	so what we are doing is we are trying to make allocations only in zero positions, which means only in positions where the dual slack is zero, which means we are indirectly applying complimentary slackness	dev
audio_0_141080.wav	and this side is v, small, a n, right	dev
audio_0_103718.wav	So, there for loss of function there is siRNA, they knob down the expression of the YAP/TAZ and for gain of function they over expressed YAP	dev
audio_0_17918.wav	Same way we are going to do for selling also	dev
audio_0_133622.wav	So size of table would be 800 times 4 divided by size of int	dev
audio_0_102435.wav	So, they tracked at multiples points	dev

audio_0_112058.wav	So, you can see that the strip line is somewhat similar to a coaxial cable ; however, all the design equations as slightly different and another thing is that these strip lines are printed on a dielectric substrate	dev
audio_0_161276.wav	its true because if it is not so, then the weak duality theorem will be violated	dev
audio_0_23744.wav	Why are there different subjects taught by different teachers	dev
audio_0_117108.wav	So, here again let us see the concept point of view	dev
audio_0_22326.wav	So, one would be teacher	dev
audio_0_156261.wav	This condition that you know this A V Beta is equal to 1 is also known as Barkhausen criteria	dev
audio_0_162087.wav	A very seamless procedure by which the top is getting explicitly initialized, of course the other data member which is a array is at automatic default initialization because it is a given array of certain size	dev
audio_0_163177.wav	Before I end, I will also show that a overload resolution may fail in different cases	dev
audio_0_17507.wav	Now, in order to achieve extra production, the workforce, that is existing employees have to reduce the time taken for each unit of the product and it is proposed to offer a pay and productivity deal so that more wage rate is paid and wage rate is increased to 4	dev
audio_0_170136.wav	So we will try to delegate it to the type of the object that is the class director	dev
audio_0_120894.wav	So, a lot of that was actually this research paper has called lift and shift, but what we are now seeing; that means, this particular composition will perhaps totally change in 2 years time	dev
audio_0_20198.wav	And along and to support the; there are several other photographic instances are also available	dev
audio_0_102358.wav	So, there are 2 pools of actin or actin exists in 2 forms have F actin and G actin	dev
audio_0_22097.wav	So we have two pages, the first page would be a login page where the student would login with a username and password	dev

audio_0_1030.wav	So now any point in this ray can be considered as x row	dev
audio_0_151632.wav	Because, the definition says that all these limits should exist finitely, but here it is not piecewise continuous because this limit at x 0 plus fx does not exist	dev
audio_0_135478.wav	if you know the load flow studies and if you know the loss formula	dev
audio_0_13001.wav	So, if you take the resultant of this 4 a this independent current source 4 ampere upward this one ampere	dev

audio_0_112748.wav	So, from here you can see that denominator is 1 minus S 2 2 gamma L which remain same here	dev
audio_0_150838.wav	And this sin 2t will be sin 2 times t minus 2	dev
audio_0_163342.wav	So, we are trying to write an add function which conceptually should add two numbers, but in C it does matter or in C++ also, it does matter as to whether the numbers it is adding are int or they are double or they are something else	dev
audio_0_133679.wav	So we would do a pre processing by statistically analysing the libc library and identify all the possible gadgets that are present in the library	dev
audio_0_16576.wav	So, this is the power v into i and energy produced is converted into heat and dissipated right	dev
audio_0_167485.wav	Double to integer conversion, this is an implicit one which is which goes through, but it gives you a warning	dev
audio_0_141999.wav	inductance will remain as l	dev
audio_0_27334.wav	Remember, this is the Lth FFT coefficient	dev

audio_0_164612.wav	Which in other words, means that you sort 5 elements starting from data	dev
audio_0_124892.wav	Next, close loop gain depends entirely on passive components, right	dev
audio_0_28765.wav	So this, basically, is your log likelihood function	dev
audio_0_24218.wav	So, my solution would be you know feed him wine, till he is absolutely stoned, he is flat and he can’t move anymore	dev
audio_0_107145.wav	In this case, in a similar manner between the spandrel which is the horizontally aligned element and the vertically aligned element which is the pier you have the beam column joint or what is referred to as a zone of low deformation and often that is idealized as a rigid node like a beam column joint in a moment resisting frame	dev
audio_0_103824.wav	Now let us imagine some scenarios what might happen when the filament polymerizes	dev
audio_0_131793.wav	So, this actual address of mylib int is move into the EAX register	dev
audio_0_128638.wav	And connect the potentiometer between the compensation pins with wiper to VEE	dev
audio_0_147029.wav	if it job is, even if the job is bigger, you will plan in advance, being aware of the job, so that he can meet the deadline and complete the assignment	dev
audio_0_172872.wav	So, for getting this information right to get the standard values, we need to have a standard set up data right	dev
audio_0_4604.wav	And this is figure seven a and this is the rotor circuit frequency is F2 is equal to sf and voltage induced of a rotor circuit just we saw SE 2	dev
audio_0_137451.wav	last one is that exact transmission line equation, that is your tan, hyperbolic, right, those things, whatever you have got, cosine, sin, tan, everything	dev
audio_0_103894.wav	So, let me first describe the setup	dev
audio_0_1994.wav	So training error, this term came from the machine learning perspective	dev
audio_0_156734.wav	So as you know, as we discussed in the previous class, the Smith Chart originates from the concept of the reflection coefficient	dev
audio_0_10277.wav	At the same time if you see this the output, at the same time if you make I 2 dash square R L because this is a load power	dev
audio_0_150059.wav	The other situation again which can be handled similar to the previous one we have the extension that what will happen when s is complex number	dev
audio_0_21579.wav	How old are you	dev
audio_0_127073.wav	So, if I draw a circuit and if I have ground here, then this terminal minus and plus; let us say this is V minus, this is V plus, then this is at virtual ground because this is ground, that is what we have understood until now	dev
audio_0_25303.wav	yeah, So what we should have is this column vector: 0 0 1 0 should be very close to H transpose times C bar	dev
audio_0_120730.wav	So, again I would emphasize that a good hair cut is not only provided by the barber by the saloon professional, but also a good hair cut needs your contribution	dev
audio_0_145966.wav	they would communicate enthusiasm, like not leaning on things because they can indicate a sense of needing support	dev
audio_0_28451.wav	Yeah, so what we can say is we have to come up with other notions of reliability, and that is what we have tried to define in todays module	dev
audio_0_136676.wav	so v, two, p plus one	dev
audio_0_20248.wav	Number 3: Improper design of the instrumentation panel itself, the all the indicators were not properly placed this	dev
audio_0_12672.wav	So, this is actually just I am making it like this, and v will be is equal to V s	dev
audio_0_21084.wav	So, where discussed about the course content, we planned a little bit in the history by paying homage to the some of the scientist	dev
audio_0_127157.wav	That you determine the output voltage of differential amplifier; so, V o is nothing, but Ad into V d plus Acm into V c m; we know this formula	dev
audio_0_118374.wav	Mathematically, I can write it in this form	dev
audio_0_162733.wav	And all that you will have to follow is a similar reasoning of going over the hierarchy	dev
audio_0_130655.wav	So, though in my example I have shown the subroutine to be at the end, but it is, it is not necessary	dev
audio_0_128547.wav	If you change the know focusing knob, you can focus the signal	dev
audio_0_135794.wav	it is a double circuit line	dev
audio_0_132870.wav	So, for example over here the least significant bit is 1 and therefore he would move this power measurement into the bucket 1	dev
audio_0_132211.wav	So, for example a1 is at a location 0804B410 and the metadata corresponding to a 1 is at the location 0804B408	dev
audio_0_152799.wav	So, for instance if we talk about the computation of the divergence, so, this surface integral can be handled in a much more simpler way and the formula which turn up out of this limiting situation, considering a volume around a point P	dev
audio_0_21114.wav	And	dev
audio_0_105929.wav	When tension is acting normal to the bed joints, then the permissible tensile stress in the masonry is 0	dev
audio_0_126668.wav	So, I have photoresist metal and SiO2	dev
audio_0_111708.wav	First, I will talk about helical antennas, and then I will cover horn antennas	dev
audio_0_119995.wav	So, once a good feeling is created, then this logo, this color scheme, everything is important to repeat, to repeat, to repeat in the customer's mind the positivity of the experience	dev
audio_0_102051.wav	So, this is the direction this represents roughly this represents the direction the cell is moving at this point of time	dev
audio_0_151635.wav	And, in this case also, we have a similar situation that the problem in this function is at t equal to 1, the function is continuous other than t equal to 1 indeed which is definitely piecewise continuous	dev
audio_0_149990.wav	And the parameter this s which belongs to some domain on the real line or in the complex plane and different kernels and different values of a and b leads to a different integral transform and the examples of various transforms are like Laplace Transform, which we will study now in this lecture	dev
audio_0_135923.wav	and particularly for when you come to the iter[ative], iterative techniques, that is, load flows, or the little bit of optimal system operation, that is economic load dispatch, we know that in the classroom or in the exam hall that it take, it is time consuming without computer, but at least one or two iterations you can try from your side quickly that what is the result	dev
audio_0_128806.wav	Let us see another component or another device, which is this one now let us keep this separate, what you see here	dev
audio_0_158272.wav	VA and VB added together minus VB added together, he is going to give me this as V A B, right	dev
audio_0_168614.wav	I can initialize it in the similar way and I can print it out using C out	dev
audio_0_169904.wav	Because we can overload as many as many types as we want as long as the overload resolution will get of them of C++ that we had discussed long ago can resolve between these overloads	dev
audio_0_154553.wav	For the triangular taper we get the lowest height of the ripples but we also get the lowest bandwidth and Klopfenstein taper is somewhere between the two	dev
audio_0_108200.wav	You have a strain gradient because whole wall is in compression but you have a strain gradient	dev
audio_0_159122.wav	so we can now do the next iteration by replacing variable x five with variable x two	dev
audio_0_132230.wav	So, ptmalloc would in fact remove a free list chunk of memory present in this list and allocate this chunk of memory to this malloc request	dev
audio_0_107943.wav	That is the first non linearity that we will be basically assuming if we begin with an assumption that the wall is hinged hinged as the boundary conditions in the initial condition itself	dev
audio_0_120526.wav	So, the CRM assessment process should see that this multichannel integration is working it should see that this matching of the value proposition is happening with respective customer rewards and this is possible, this sort of systemic working together is possible when you have a good enterprise integration through information and communication technology	dev
audio_0_117476.wav	Now, if I compare these amplifiers in terms of conduction angle and efficiency	dev
audio_0_12682.wav	Because, when t tends to infinity your I told you, when t tends to infinity, this part term will vanish right, so that means transient will vanish only left out portion will be that is steady state	dev
audio_0_161830.wav	so this seven becomes minus seven, minus five and so on	dev
audio_0_24790.wav	So I will be sort of a bug on the wall for most of the time I will just be observing what you guys are doing, in case there are things that you need help with I think that I can probably butt in and probably help, I will do that otherwise mostly you are sort of auto director, ok over see you guys	dev
audio_0_172982.wav	So, we calculated the different proteins here I show an example with 10 proteins	dev
audio_0_102650.wav	So, to summarize we have seen how the AFM can be made use of for studying protein unfolding and what is the signature of protein unfolding, that you can say that this means based on this signature I can claim that this is protein unfolding	dev
audio_0_13388.wav	Because I is equal to your I m sin omega t no , no nothing is there with that	dev
audio_0_172059.wav	This is discussed earlier; this is the high scoring pairs; how many high scoring pairs in the alignment, right	dev
audio_0_2480.wav	And then, he checks for the film thickness, the wax film thickness and also the you know thickness here is depth in meter, of course and also the coverage area of the wax within the inner and outer door ok	dev
audio_0_107643.wav	Even there it is not going to be a marked point as far as the yield of the structure is concerned	dev
audio_0_149749.wav	So, having this product, so L we have t power m minus 1 the Laplace of t power n minus 1 and we have the product there	dev
audio_0_16850.wav	So, I will write like this 1 plus 1 by 3 as it is kilo ohm	dev
audio_0_162443.wav	So, we saw that these is up cast are usually, OK; but if you down cast then you are going from generalization to specialization, so you actually have less information and you are trying to infer more information and that gets risky	dev
audio_0_27678.wav	this is the estimate of the real part	dev
audio_0_114286.wav	Now, let us say the average time to reach to this buncher cavity is t naught, and average time to leave the cavity is t g, then what will be the transit time transit time will be tau is equal to t g minus t naught	dev
audio_0_1861.wav	So, you can find out here these values are shown here	dev
audio_0_139427.wav	also, i have to find out what will be the q injection such that i can maintain this voltage and such the same time of the power loss	dev
audio_0_15919.wav	So, in general we can write that dq is equal to i dt	dev
audio_0_104890.wav	So, in this case so, compared to C57 the gamma soarcoglycan deficiency cells are more contractile	dev
audio_0_127808.wav	So, when you see this, you when you see this is what you will get you will get is the difference between you get the band which areis not allowed to be passed	dev
audio_0_27301.wav	these are simply the frequency domain, and that is the important difference with respect to OFDM	dev
audio_0_134688.wav	So, this is this power is taken for each of these devices and plotted together for the same input and key	dev
audio_0_157227.wav	I think it should take anywhere between 4 to 5 hours because I am not really going to deal with it in great detail	dev
audio_0_125684.wav	So again, I can draw the transfer characteristics, if I have or if I know the drain characteristics that is I D versus V D S	dev
audio_0_13149.wav	So, it is minus t 0, if you take the this side negative will come, but distance is 1 minus t 0 minus your t 0 plus 1 right	dev
audio_0_1196.wav	These are the notations we have used	dev
audio_0_170129.wav	This virtual function will get delegated because manager classes over did in this function with the logic of how to compute manager salary and this will correctly invoke the process salary of the manager	dev
audio_0_100961.wav	So, each tissue in our body has a distinct mechanical property	dev
audio_0_143504.wav	but if you, if you see that approximate values for d e q can be calculated quickly, which is very close to exact value, if we assume that you neglect all this thing, if we assume that, instead of subtracting this point four and this, that if you take ten, ten into twenty	dev
audio_0_14967.wav	So, now this one determine the voltage across the 5 ohm resister for the dots given in the diagram, then reverse the polarity in 1 coil and repeat	dev
audio_0_123774.wav	This op amp will do what it can to make the input voltage difference or voltage difference between the input terminals to be zero these are two golden rules that we had to remember when we understand the operational amplifier when we understand the operational amplifier	dev
audio_0_170557.wav	So, you can share and you can get these sequences from UniProt, but if you want to use any of these tools, there you can use the SWISS PROT or PIR	dev
audio_0_21178.wav	they are used a fast reactors	dev
audio_0_118848.wav	So, we defined earlier it terms of ah degree just to convert it in radian	dev
audio_0_27666.wav	So this is basically your complex noise, this is your complex parameter, this is the complex observation, This is the complex observation	dev
audio_0_110140.wav	That can lead to a different state of stress in the block in the masonry prism itself	dev
audio_0_153413.wav	So, here this s into s square plus 1 and then numerator will be A plus B s square plus Cs is equal to A	dev
audio_0_160897.wav	so what i do is i put zero, which is three minus three times one, is zero	dev
audio_0_168152.wav	And you cannot create an instance, but the fact that a function is purely virtual says that an implementation for that function is not necessary, but it does not say that I cannot have an implementation	dev
audio_0_167101.wav	We are writing arr dot resize, we call this as resize being a member function of the vector type	dev
audio_0_150223.wav	So, when this equality will happen that we have to understand that what should be the orientation of the curve and what should be the orientation of the normal	dev
audio_0_116722.wav	So, what had happened	dev
audio_0_148274.wav	whether you find time, you can mentally, physically, spiritually and socially	dev
audio_0_119652.wav	So, there are certain sets of services, where cost and this is true for most services, but there are certain other technology intensive services, were differentiation can play an important part	dev
audio_0_127561.wav	wWe see that still it is still suppressed because it is below f L, the frequency cut off frequency of the high pass filter	dev
audio_0_127150.wav	So, CMRR is many times expressed in decibels and CMRR is nothing but 20 log Ad by Acm	dev
audio_0_106550.wav	So, we will continue in the next class	dev
audio_0_116522.wav	That means, percentage error is about 1	dev
audio_0_110838.wav	So, you can choose A for lower noise figure, but lower gain choose B for higher gain but higher noise figure	dev
audio_0_3022.wav	55 cubes, I a 2 will be approximately 8 ampere	dev
audio_0_165199.wav	Now, here what do I have on the right hand side	dev
audio_0_15390.wav	So, this portions call ideal transformers, right	dev
audio_0_163978.wav	So, the constructor of name will get called	dev
audio_0_24298.wav	I will give you some time you want to think about it, okay you can pause the video and think about it	dev
audio_0_158676.wav	so we now use this value of x one that we have taken and we substitute it in this x three equation to get: x three is equal to twenty one minus three times x one	dev
audio_0_162483.wav	And we have seen earlier also while discussing const ness as a property that I may have a non constant variable say i and I may have a constant reference to this variable	dev
audio_0_135378.wav	so p, your p i, cannot be greater than your, your p e	dev
audio_0_111127.wav	So, I also want to tell you that there is a bit ah debate going on all over the world people says it is sun heating is more versus microwave heating, but just to tell you the two heating processes are totally different and let me explain in a very simple manner	dev
audio_0_138881.wav	condition is that while line is open circuit, when i r is equal to zero, right	dev
audio_0_167444.wav	So, I have regularly try to show you the comparison between C style of solving problem and C++ style of solving the problem	dev
audio_0_117343.wav	So, if the network is reciprocal then 21 will be equal to S 12 or we can say AD minus BC is equal to 1, ok	dev
audio_0_135514.wav	that means for the case of, for where off peak load is zero, that means load factor is equal to loss factor	dev
audio_0_132299.wav	So, this for example A00 to A07 is an 8 way corresponds to the 8 way associative cache	dev
audio_0_129751.wav	You see this is similar to this one alright, this is the closed chamber now what I am showing is when you open the chamber how it looks like alright	dev
audio_0_20905.wav	And therefore, total number of the sub atomic particles that is protons and neutrons will be conserved, but total number atoms may not be conserved	dev
audio_0_172252.wav	So, what are the various features, how to get these sequences in a particular cluster	dev
audio_0_154082.wav	So we have EZ is equal to HZ equal to 0, where Z corresponds to the direction of propagation	dev
audio_0_25567.wav	So we are talking about the estimation of a vector parameter, H bar	dev
audio_0_117081.wav	So, from here to here 90 degree, another 90 degree, so phase will be minus 180	dev
audio_0_156125.wav	So if initially this blue curve was representing the transistors input output characteristics, now due to this power combining the entire characteristic shifts rightwards and so we get that the input power at which the saturation or gain reduction starts happening is now shifted to a higher value and that is why we are getting the higher value of gain	dev
audio_0_103893.wav	So, the title of the paper is collective migration of and epithelial mono layer in response to a model wound it was published in PNAS in 2007	dev
audio_0_170940.wav	Once we get the alignment correction, then you go with backbone generation because we get the template your template is ready, then for your target you can just copy the backbone because the backbone is same right the target and the template, and use this as your to build a model	dev
audio_0_106333.wav	This working stress approach is also extended to the reinforced masonry clauses and the section in the National Building Code of 2016	dev
audio_0_159556.wav	a zero that now has two lines passing through is actually an unwanted zero and that is not going to help	dev
audio_0_107535.wav	So, this excess moisture actually needs to leave the clay otherwise if you put it right into the oven, that's going to become steam and create problems for you in the strength gain of the brick itself	dev
audio_0_25542.wav	the ML estimate of H bar minimises the above cost function	dev
audio_0_155502.wav	So, in that case the capacitance that exist between the lines C 12, that, we draw a line through it, that can be considered as a combination of 2 series capacitances 2 C 12, 2C 12	dev
audio_0_170834.wav	So, what is a occupancy	dev
audio_0_898.wav	Say let us consider these are the column vectors and a point x prime is as you know that this is a basically a column vector and is its coordinate let me represented as say x y and some scale value k that is the homogeneous coordinate system so let me represent in this form so when we have a matrix multiplication so let us consider this scenario so when this, no, not the cross product of E prime cross x prime	dev
audio_0_140717.wav	so next is we will come to another two thing, that is that shunt capacitors and series capacitors, right	dev
audio_0_16031.wav	So, basically from this source the current i 1 is flowing this current this is open nothing is going	dev
audio_0_169616.wav	DrawArrr is an array of these function pointers	dev
audio_0_156845.wav	First I connect a length of transmission line corresponding to theta	dev
audio_0_112002.wav	So, you might wonder; why this descript and see the reason for that is that when this copper mesh or this particular copper file is put here, there may be a small air gap over here in between which will give rise to a slightly higher impedance value	dev
audio_0_143899.wav	so the two first two things are very, very significant because these are the two ways issues will be addressing during our experiments that will be doing together in this lessons	dev
audio_0_173041.wav	This is can be any decision function right	dev
audio_0_16994.wav	This is the total current i here, right	dev
audio_0_117243.wav	Next question is this network lossless	dev
audio_0_103772.wav	So, this if you have a rigid immovable wall and the backside of your actin network is anchored	dev
audio_0_138168.wav	b is negative sequence network and c is zero sequence network for synchronous machine	dev
audio_0_103556.wav	So, expose it to a certain amount of force for constant amount of time, and see how the system responds to it	dev
audio_0_11422.wav	Now, if you divide equation 1 by equation 2, you will get P loss upon P loss dash is equal to say 2 R upon R dash right; you will you just do it, you will get it	dev
audio_0_20381.wav	And the most common one of them is the control rods	dev
audio_0_138646.wav	that means whatever we have said: the symmetrical component, positive, negative and zero sequence, right	dev
audio_0_106371.wav	So, the code allows you to account for an effective flange width as being something that contributes to the lateral road resistance of the masonry wall	dev
audio_0_163287.wav	So, if I multiply them, I will get another square matrix C as a result by the rules and you understand that since we are writing this in C, the call by value we need to use pointers to get the output from this function	dev
audio_0_129169.wav	1 volt, 2 volts, Vout is 1 volt	dev
audio_0_2435.wav	So, you have a grip of the person as you can see over the nuzzle ok	dev
audio_0_135666.wav	right, the machine is dynamics associated with the machine will cause virtually no change in the voltage and frequency of the thevenin's voltage e b	dev
audio_0_126697.wav	This is my second mask	dev
audio_0_117249.wav	So that means, this particular network is not lossless because it is not equal to 1 hence this is a lossy network	dev
audio_0_3851.wav	So, I will show you a simple circuit having 2 meshes current source exist in mesh 2, right	dev
audio_0_163763.wav	So, what it does it takes again generates another code were t is taken to be double a similar code of max is generated and that is compiled and that particular	dev
audio_0_16615.wav	That means let me clear it	dev
audio_0_111188.wav	So, but those precautions actually have resulted into a little better thing and after a few slides I am going to tell you what are those things	dev
audio_0_11085.wav	Then you write R i your i is equal to then your I m sin omega t	dev
audio_0_157437.wav	So, now if I have only at 110 degrees, if I am going to have VD2 equal to say 200 volts, then what will happen	dev
audio_0_125223.wav	wWhat is the reading, and when we connect see red to red probe to red and black one to black	dev
audio_0_158513.wav	the penalty for the first row is one, the penalty for the first row is one, and since we have only one row now, penalty for the first row is one	dev
audio_0_154421.wav	So what we see here is that when we have a cascade of elements connected, the highest noise contribution to the overall noise figure is from the 1st stage	dev
audio_0_150053.wav	So, we have e power minus s minus a t divided by this minus s minus a where this t goes from 0 to infinity	dev
audio_0_141694.wav	right now, the current per phase is given by that i r is equal to s conjugate up on three v r conjugate	dev
audio_0_157773.wav	And if I try to look at what is the phase shift between the voltage and current, you know, waveform, it will be exactly same as the power factor angle of the load	dev
audio_0_4580.wav	So, therefore, it is it is therefore, seen that that the frequency of rotor current is induced emf and [ ] rea[ctance] and reactance all vary in direct proportion to the slip	dev
audio_0_166544.wav	And do the reasoning about the engine type on this hierarchy if you want say you want to have another hierarchy in terms of the carriage type as to whether it is for passengers, whether it is for a goods, whether it is it is for customer and so on	dev
audio_0_2397.wav	So, all these things are done through this inner side and the mounting is given by the access provided on the inner side of the door	dev
audio_0_141389.wav	so first, one is a single phase two winding transformer is rated twenty five k v a	dev
audio_0_131357.wav	Suppose let us say that we take a particular object present in security class B and take another object present in security class A, suppose we actually create a third object which is based on these two objects that is the green object and the blue object, so the join relation would define the security class for this third object	dev
audio_0_141612.wav	so it is	dev
audio_0_117590.wav	So, this harmonic will be absent in class B amplifier	dev
audio_0_20722.wav	So, this Sm 149 absorbing neutron becomes Sm 150	dev
audio_0_166345.wav	Now what I want to track through this is I want to track that certainly I am assuming that all these print jobs actually fire the printing on a single printer	dev
audio_0_3211.wav	So, whatever will come here with the 13 it will be in series whatever will come here it will be in series is 30 and whatever will come here it will be in series in 40 that is whatever you have got 4 point 4 four 8	dev
audio_0_135782.wav	it was given that forty five percent of that	dev
audio_0_102589.wav	So, if you reflect it about this axis, it will come up and then you reflect it about that axis and translate it then you will get this	dev
audio_0_123243.wav	What is the resistance between this terminal and ground, right	dev
audio_0_152210.wav	And here as a conclusion, we also observed that the function is actually differentiable at z equal to 0 but note that function may not be differentiable	dev
audio_0_119810.wav	So, the journey starts from services quality that is essential	dev
audio_0_106366.wav	So this is the code moves between prescriptive requirements and some design checks that you need to do	dev
audio_0_101882.wav	So, you have you start with a filament of three monomers	dev
audio_0_159956.wav	there are three assignments shown in blue color	dev
audio_0_169940.wav	So I can say that in my signature how should this operator function look like the first operand is of the O stream type because c out is an object of the O stream type	dev
audio_0_21784.wav	Yeah, in every class I use it	dev

audio_0_2637.wav	Just because a previous information has happened, or a event has happened, that does not mean the succeeding event will be dependent on the previous event	dev
audio_0_141156.wav	right now the phase load current can be given as i l is equal to v phase upon z l	dev
audio_0_19586.wav	So, instead of assuming the highest possible production, here we assume that there will be some normal idle time and activity will proceed with a normal efficiency and there are good equipments but they are not necessarily the best equipment the demand is good but is not necessarily the maximum so these are the normal standards which are set for normal conditions	dev
audio_0_149273.wav	let say, and this time the title changes, the meaning of the image changes	dev
audio_0_135836.wav	actually, this is infinite bus side	dev

audio_0_109112.wav	So, the point is and the reason why it is low, energy dissipation is low, is that you get a tensile heel crack formed in the wall and probably that might extend to about 80, 85 percent of the length of the wall	dev
audio_0_148525.wav	do you plan and allocate time for different activities	dev
audio_0_164972.wav	And when we are doing this if I go back to the hierarchy diagram then this is the diagram B is a A	dev

audio_0_104697.wav	3 integrin is what binds to fibrinogen; however, when you add this peptide RGD you see that the clot falls apart	dev
audio_0_159681.wav	so we first find that variable which is most negative and say that variable goes out	dev
audio_0_129766.wav	So, when I open the door it looks like this	dev
audio_0_164054.wav	So, I am showing an example 1 plus 2 star 3 minus 4, if I have to evaluate this expression though we read the expression from left to right, when we go to evaluate this we will not strictly be able to evaluate left to right	dev
audio_0_129434.wav	You as you see that it is used as free running oscillators	dev
audio_0_18696.wav	In absence of budget, there will be lack of clarity amongst the departments, employees or functions as to what exactly they are supposed to achieve	dev
audio_0_123044.wav	So, that is what we have found and now if you see that when we apply a voltage apply a voltage at the input right apply the voltage at the input, which is 5 Volts peak to peak at 50 Hertz, then what is the output	dev
audio_0_11542.wav	So, minus j 8 ohm and it is 50 volt it is 40 volt and it is your what you call 90 volt	dev
audio_0_156829.wav	This is G equal to 1 circle since we are on the Y Smith chart	dev

audio_0_163930.wav	So, if we look at if you try to see the order in which the constructors get called, we will see that the first this constructor gets called	dev
audio_0_138818.wav	this is called type one modification	dev
audio_0_164192.wav	Unless I can access the next field of the node I cannot go to the next node on the list so I need to access them	dev
audio_0_167995.wav	Similarly, if I have a the derived class constructor, it takes two numbers; first it uses to construct the base part, calls a base part constructor; and the second, it uses to initialize its own pointer data, it dynamically allocates an integer with the value of D 2 and sets a pointer to the ptr member	dev
audio_0_118922.wav	And we saw, how to design this power divider using radial stub	dev
audio_0_123398.wav	So, we have P type substrate, andthere is no channel formation initially	dev
audio_0_148810.wav	that's the barrier to communication	dev
audio_0_160239.wav	so this is how we will write the dual when we have unequal number of variables and constraints in the primal	dev
audio_0_116308.wav	So, the magnetic field is maximum at x is equal to 0 and x equal to a and it is 0 at x is equal to a by 2	dev
audio_0_18905.wav	Delay in the payment of overreeds is 1 month	dev
audio_0_141151.wav	the star is a complex conjugate of power phase load current: i l	dev
audio_0_119711.wav	So, there are other tourist attractions created around Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam	dev
audio_0_153896.wav	So, passive circuits are one which do not produce or circuits where the output power or rather I should say passive circuits are the ones which do not require external power supply whatever power they need for their operation come from the input itself	dev
audio_0_21596.wav	So when you have a smart phone or a laptop while taking notes or accessing something, is there anyone monitoring you like this is what has to be done and are you taking down like this notes	dev
audio_0_2728.wav	This is taken from this reference	dev
audio_0_166708.wav	So, first the r e gets initialized, then i m gets initialized and this is the event three, E3, that will happen	dev
audio_0_12610.wav	Now, if you take at any point any point here say this point is a, now if I take one current is going like this just, you think like this	dev
audio_0_100390.wav	So you know in several cases that a set of high dix activities should have been identified	dev
audio_0_160193.wav	in the module we will move forward to study another interesting aspects of linear programming, which is called duality	dev
audio_0_157261.wav	But if there is something I am dealing with from some other book I will let you know	dev
audio_0_159104.wav	so we have a situation, we have a solution, where the primal is infeasible as well as the dual is infeasible	dev
audio_0_26392.wav	We have shown that… Basically we derived covariance of the noise vector, V bar, and based on that we have shown is basically that the noise estimate is missing, that the estimate of the channel coefficient is again	dev
audio_0_3951.wav	So, my suggestion is you follow some your what you call some good books for solving numericals right	dev
audio_0_11847.wav	This is your b by 2	dev
audio_0_1955.wav	You suppose you know also the form of these functions and apply different techniques to derive this function	dev
audio_0_165395.wav	Once g is called then certainly the first situation is a happy part, the normal flow; so g will come out through the return	dev
audio_0_20505.wav	And these are the corresponding their variation of their cross section with energy, and you can see in the thermal energy level it is extremely high	dev
audio_0_162668.wav	So, if we want to see again in terms of the construction of D what should happen	dev
audio_0_27139.wav	Therefore, if you look at the system of equations, 1 bar to equals 2, H transpose times c bar, that is an over determined system	dev
audio_0_1534.wav	So I will start from the root and in the root I will be considering the dimension X	dev
audio_0_161745.wav	you know that the solution is x one equal to three, x two equal to four, with objective function value equal to sixty six	dev
audio_0_169523.wav	So the result of this, the first parameter a is copied to the first formal parameter x	dev
audio_0_114429.wav	Now if you want to align these local co ordinate system with edge or ah particular point you can do with these options easily	dev
audio_0_103912.wav	So, let us say this is some distance moved and this is time	dev
audio_0_117779.wav	So, basically what the principle is that reflected amplitude and phase are captured for reconstruction of images for underground object	dev
audio_0_106781.wav	And for the second modulus, the prescription is that you take one third of the compressive strength of the masonry unit	dev
audio_0_160998.wav	we look at solving the assignment problem by a special method which is faster and which is tailor made to solve the assignment problem	dev
audio_0_139374.wav	now we have to obtain from this equation an equivalent time model for the transformer, right	dev
audio_0_107084.wav	But if you have multiple floors, then the story shear force corresponding to each story has to be estimated from the overall base shear and that depends on a certain distribution that you will assume along the height	dev
audio_0_166570.wav	Now, another major point to note in this sample ‘hello world’ program is when we do printf, we can have arbitrary number of parameters, we call this variadic function	dev
audio_0_140790.wav	this is generally	dev
audio_0_158495.wav	now, having identified the second column with the largest penalty, try to put as much as you can in the least cost position in corresponding column so that the penalty can be avoided	dev
audio_0_26161.wav	this is your pilot symbol	dev
audio_0_103210.wav	So, this is your X Y plane and this your, so you have X, Y and Z	dev
audio_0_171225.wav	No, we cannot use DSSP because it gives you a residue wise, NACCESS we can use right or getarea you can use for each atoms	dev
audio_0_109585.wav	So you see that the two, the expression that you see here basically eliminates the unknown states of stress	dev
audio_0_16365.wav	So, it will be plus v 1 plus v 2 plus v 3 minus 300 is equal to 0 ; that means, my v 3 is equal to your 300 minus v 1 minus v 2 right ah it is v 1 minus v 2 and this this 2 capacitors are in parallel; that means, v 3 is equal to v 4 right because this v these 2 are in parallel So, go to that ah that calculation	dev
audio_0_102566.wav	So, InVols as I said is called inverse optical lever sensitivity	dev
audio_0_172223.wav	Because if we have a dipeptides or tripeptides, there is possibility of several pepetides, but they are not similar, even then you can see several tripeptides or dipeptides they are similar to each other, the possibility is very high	dev
audio_0_102504.wav	So, what we want to know is to, how the structure of fibronectin is necessary for its function and particularly how forces regulate functioning of fibronectin through unfolding of its individual domains	dev
audio_0_101308.wav	It is an accumulation of ECM proteins including collagen 1	dev
audio_0_115439.wav	Now, after educating all the traces that is s 11, s 21, s 12 and s 22 you can see here all the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient in one window	dev
audio_0_26901.wav	now this can be implemented rather very easily because X check is a diagonal matrix	dev
audio_0_102143.wav	So, these are ECM coated island stamped on top of polyacrylamie gels	dev
audio_0_139219.wav	so that is the incremental cost curve and this is pg megawatt, although it is linear	dev
audio_0_120891.wav	So, fundamentally those parts of services of a total composite service those parts, which could be moved to a low cost region without coming in the way of the main service	dev
audio_0_130089.wav	Now, also based on the category there are four low pass, high pass, band pass, band reject, but if you want to form a digital filter that can be implemented using a digital computer or it can be also implemented using special purpose digital hardware	dev
audio_0_120544.wav	And of course, the whole issue about service recovery, that we discussed last week	dev
audio_0_133068.wav	So, details about this virtual address base can be obtained from the proc directory present in your Linux operating systems	dev
audio_0_121220.wav	We are then of course discussed about prices, which are linked and we will take up this p, the price part in little detail later	dev
audio_0_134102.wav	Also, you could send break points such as b to line number 10, so what this means is that the program will execute until the break point 10 act line number 10 is obtained	dev
audio_0_137929.wav	so this i a one, this i a one you directly substitute, then you will get this i a one	dev
audio_0_127577.wav	And or when we were between f L were between f L and f H, you would have seen the voltage which was around 350, 400 milli volts, right	dev
audio_0_15842.wav	So, if you take the derivative of this one	dev
audio_0_19647.wav	As the name suggests, if company or the concerned department is not using the resources effectively, it will be the variance due to efficiency	dev
audio_0_149556.wav	And then we have to just to perform this multiplication, this multiplication and then we have to add it	dev
audio_0_18560.wav	2 by 10, that means 20%	dev
audio_0_128184.wav	So, what does that mean by controlling the area	dev
audio_0_131498.wav	Next what we also, see is the main function where you have a local variable x which has a value zero then there is an invocation to the function with parameters 1, 2 and 3 and then there is a statement with x equal to 1 and then there is a printf value of x %d	dev
audio_0_3307.wav	So, P G will be 3 I 1 square R f right because this is my r f here your here it is here it is small r f I have written	dev
audio_0_149476.wav	And from this component form it is very easy now to write the Gauss Seidel method because the only differences in the Gauss Seidel method, instead of using this xi铆s from the kth iteration from the previous iteration, because we are evaluating now at k plus 1th iteration and we are using all the values of x1, x2, x3, xn from the previous iteration	dev
audio_0_172882.wav	So, there you can get the redundant alpha and the non redundant alpha right also they redundant beta and non redundant beta right	dev
audio_0_109746.wav	Mud motor was predominant in the construction in the historic constructions	dev
audio_0_105890.wav	Reinforce masonry treated as ordinary reinforced masonry or special reinforced masonry	dev
audio_0_108638.wav	But it is also interesting to see where the additional resistance, where the global resistance to earthquake, favourable earthquake response of confined masonry constructions come from and simple calculations can actually be done to estimate the improved flexual capacity of walls when you have confinement and improved shear capacity when you have confined confinement by the confining elements in reinforced concrete	dev
audio_0_27093.wav	instant k minus1, which is interfering with the current symbol x k	dev
audio_0_121271.wav	So, best of luck and let us review then in the context of strategic service vision	dev
audio_0_157017.wav	So, if I had had fired it anywhere here also T2 and T3 would have taken over without any difficulty	dev
audio_0_118012.wav	So, I had design even n equal to 10 quarter wave transformer	dev
audio_0_162417.wav	Now, certainly if I want to take it to integer, this will become 35, which is your 10s complement, but or 2s complement representation which is very different	dev
audio_0_121027.wav	And on the other hand, good information, right appropriate information will have to be provided to the patient or to the restaurant customer in different services in different circumstances	dev
audio_0_104322.wav	In other words, let’s say this is a pulled configuration from this point the tip goes down and then you again pull	dev
audio_0_116657.wav	So, you can see bandwidth for VSWR less than 1	dev
audio_0_124302.wav	So, that you keep on understanding how the things looks like, the same time we will move forward with our lecture in which we have to understand how you can fabricate the integrated circuit and then you will understand the operational amplifier and it is uses	dev
audio_0_139684.wav	you can solve for q c, but our interest to find out the charge, right	dev
audio_0_129425.wav	P type material once that is done; what is the next step	dev

audio_0_167955.wav	If the function body is very large, then the additional over rate of call and return are very small, so you do not want to get it all this trouble of inlineing, but if the function body is very small inlineing release	dev
audio_0_100190.wav	First estimate, the overall estimate, first calculate the overall estimate, then distribute the proportions of the overall estimate to the individual components	dev
audio_0_130448.wav	So, in pinch off my voltage across drain and source VDS would be equals to VGS minus threshold voltage, then my pinch off will occur in this particular condition I have VGD equals to	dev
audio_0_156996.wav	So, if R I, if I say this is I times R, whereas this is I, so wherever I R is equal to the supply voltage, the current will start declining after that point	dev
audio_0_24997.wav	Maybe he want to draw more diagrams and write more, we are considering an ideal student who wants to write we are in a Ok, so he will be happy	dev
audio_0_20174.wav	And of course, we have to go back to 1945 to Hiroshima	dev
audio_0_22921.wav	So write it down, write down the ideas that’s the main take away from this method this stage in design thinking	dev
audio_0_117962.wav	And we know that Z L is equal to 100 Ohm in this particular case	dev
audio_0_119903.wav	Unconditional guarantee or composite guarantee, because unless you have good quality level, unless you are very clear that we able to executed then there is no point in given that kind of guarantee	dev
audio_0_107631.wav	So, if you're looking at R factors of 3 or 4, what's really, what is really what this R factor is doing	dev
audio_0_14266.wav	Now when t greater than 0 the switch is open and the equivalent rc circuit	dev
audio_0_27353.wav	And you can see, this equalisation is a very simple process	dev
audio_0_128130.wav	Second is that it is highly reliable	dev
audio_0_124893.wav	Independent of op amp, why entirely to passive components	dev
audio_0_130276.wav	And pass band gain right pass band gain is given 2 right; where is the input	dev
audio_0_117788.wav	So, these days radar systems are being use for many automobile application	dev
audio_0_123693.wav	So, this is the antiphase output antiphase output	dev
audio_0_138898.wav	you send your answer to me, right, but here i am not giving that answer right	dev
audio_0_100873.wav	So, what is actin polymerization rate	dev
audio_0_137341.wav	then log one upon d a b right, because b to a, i a distance is a to b, d a b, i a log d a b	dev
audio_0_128496.wav	Is it multiplication or addition	dev
audio_0_15244.wav	You follow any book any any any machine book you will find all these things are there with this	dev
audio_0_162071.wav	So you ask a question that can we do better than this, can we when the stack is actually instantiated when it is defined is it possible that right at that instantiation point if this initialization call can be somehow done	dev
audio_0_116843.wav	These are the cases reported in Mumbai	dev
audio_0_172209.wav	So, it takes a specific set or specific subset, and then sees whether you can find any subset of residues which are same between two sequences	dev
audio_0_104693.wav	Similarly, for binding to RGD you can have various combinations in one in which you can have	dev
audio_0_848.wav	So this is one example I have taken from the book of Hurtley and Giserman which is shown which is also shown here multiple view geometry in computer vision	dev
audio_0_13614.wav	475 Kilo Hertz now next is that from this diagram	dev
audio_0_19037.wav	So out of A and B, which product line will you choose	dev
audio_0_128616.wav	This is called the offset	dev
audio_0_131645.wav	So, this technique also takes care of human factor as well	dev
audio_0_172575.wav	Because in this case we are going to keep protein as a rigid particle and then we are allowing the ligand to move around in this specified grid box	dev
audio_0_154877.wav	In the previous module we had saw how a basic microstrip, how basic matching lumped elements can be done and how using short lengths of high impedance or low impedance microstrip lines they can be used to substitute for inductances and capacitances	dev
audio_0_104979.wav	So, in this case the properties that you measure in rheology versus you measure under the condition in this in which the gel is cross linked	dev
audio_0_126183.wav	The most certain way of to succeed is always to try just once once more one more time; that means, that we generate try to give up the thing, right when it does not work	dev

audio_0_13482.wav	This is a rectangular form this form because for that addition and subtraction will be helpful, right	dev
audio_0_127048.wav	So, in the next module, we will see another experiment, or another characteristics of an operational amplifier	dev
audio_0_1036.wav	So you get in this way this is a direct relationships	dev
audio_0_3479.wav	So, in magnetic field is required and you are what you call and conductors which will also the what you call which can also	dev
audio_0_103334.wav	So, you have a spring of certain length	dev
audio_0_1308.wav	M is a 3 plus 3 sub matrix	dev
audio_0_103598.wav	So, a typical case of an amplitude sweep	dev
audio_0_167519.wav	Of course, C style casting will work in almost every case	dev
audio_0_108932.wav	So, the first zone is purely in compression	dev
audio_0_126490.wav	Then after developing photoresist you can go for post bake	dev
audio_0_163539.wav	Similarly, if you add 2 with 2, it should become 1; if I add 2 plus 2 then it should become 1, so that is a kind of definition that I am looking at	dev
audio_0_143691.wav	positive attributes and that positivity will help you to overcome the setbacks and difficulties and you will bounce back from difficulties and come out with success in a adverse situations	dev
audio_0_164314.wav	So, you would expect your first reaction would be there should be a compilation here, but interestingly it is not	dev
audio_0_119320.wav	That you have the core product is food and around it we have payment consolidation, let me go through a little bit more in detail that what are this different elements	dev
audio_0_100671.wav	This analogy would not work for cells like red blood cells which continuously circulate within the bloodstream and are not really adherent	dev

audio_0_100835.wav	You can see the intensity which is at certain point here it goes on getting inside and inside	dev
audio_0_16959.wav	Because, it is a short circuit it is a short circuit right	dev
audio_0_152449.wav	So, this there is a root between 0 and 1 and certainly that is going to be here the smallest root we have	dev
audio_0_148152.wav	self promotion skills is something which we have not touched upon here	dev
audio_0_128636.wav	What is it that we need to make Vo equal to 0	dev
audio_0_169412.wav	Similarly, if I do typeid ampersand a dot name it will give the name of that type	dev
audio_0_158651.wav	now the second equation is four x one plus three x two plus x four, equal to twenty four	dev
audio_0_118796.wav	Then from here select FR 4 substrate select a FR 4 lossy and then load it	dev
audio_0_141393.wav	so using that means low voltage side	dev
audio_0_165158.wav	It can be one of this it, that is it is also possible that you do not use const you just do a copy without a constant on the parameter	dev
audio_0_124512.wav	How you will deposit this metal	dev
audio_0_114525.wav	So, it is showing the same behavior as band pass filter should do	dev

audio_0_123636.wav	So, for once you know the process to fabricate the MOSFET, you will know the process for fabricating rest of the devices all right	dev
audio_0_161967.wav	so we have used this in ah in an earlier situation	dev
audio_0_1088.wav	So the first method says you can fundamental matrix you can always know estimate the camera matrices P and P prime using the method what we discussed and then you can obtain the plane because you have three scene points and you solve for the three scene points construct three scene points and obtain the plane and then from there you can compute the plane induced tomography that is h equals a minus a v transpose given the parameter in this form	dev
audio_0_169399.wav	For example, if you have a class A or something I mean whatever that class A is and you have a variable of type A or rather let me just do it you have a pointer of this type p A	dev
audio_0_104560.wav	I have briefly given your gist of how extracellular proteins, extracellular metrics can regulate cell behavior	dev
audio_0_156064.wav	And in fact, in terms of those Alpha 1 and Alpha 3, this 1 dB compression point is given byÉ So at the 1 dB, we will have 20 log g A in 1dB that is this power	dev
audio_0_153285.wav	So, if we take the Laplace transform of this g t which is defined here as t equal to 1 and otherwise sin t in that case we will end up with 1 over s square plus 1 and it is clear because the integral which is 0 to infinity e power minus s t and for instance this g t dt, it does not read the value at discrete points	dev
audio_0_165929.wav	We can change that by introducing the virtual keyword	dev
audio_0_128505.wav	This is the operation, like I said it is an operation, because now is the right now it is in mathematical mode	dev
audio_0_16425.wav	Anyway, you understood this way everything will find too easy right	dev
audio_0_123390.wav	Input bias current is I B equals to x plus y by 2, we can write mod, right	dev
audio_0_154384.wav	This is noise less and value of this IN square is given by the value of this VN square is given by	dev
audio_0_128188.wav	Dielectric is a simply an insulator	dev
audio_0_141539.wav	so in this case one can see that v a one is equal to this	dev
audio_0_115251.wav	So, here is a line for minus forty db this is minus 50 you can see that this is less than minus 47 db over the entire range	dev
audio_0_154349.wav	Now for our purpose you know when we define noise, the average value that is the ensemble average or the time average both are equal to 0	dev
audio_0_143485.wav	so that's why d s is equal to r 0 [FL]	dev
audio_0_135609.wav	now part c	dev
audio_0_128367.wav	So, suppose we are changing the phase, you can see that there is a change in the sine wave	dev
audio_0_116197.wav	Whereas, wave guides can be operated above a certain frequency called as cutoff frequencyso it acts as a high pass filter	dev
audio_0_111117.wav	Now, you might wonder that we are talking about RF, why we are talking about microwave heating principle I will come to that in a short while	dev
audio_0_114591.wav	So, to find the input impedance at this particular port we have to look from here, so then we come at this point and then we have to look at this here	dev
audio_0_168274.wav	My data members are still private and since it is moved inside the class, it has only one parameter, which is the right hand side parameter	dev
audio_0_17153.wav	So, in that case, it will be 10 ohm and I told you, here it is 25 ohm right, this is missed actually	dev
audio_0_25832.wav	so the framework of sequential estimation	dev
audio_0_20698.wav	And this iodine has a 70 percent probability of going through a beta decay to produce this xenon 135, but that is basically the primary reaction, iodine 135, its half life is also very small only 6	dev
audio_0_138876.wav	so actually, for quick calculations for a, b, c, d parameters, this equation is, i think, less laborious, i mean easier to compute	dev
audio_0_165751.wav	What is C1 assigned C2 assigned C3	dev
audio_0_140509.wav	generator two is grounded right	dev
audio_0_167772.wav	So, this mechanism can be used not only to clean up the just a clean up the objects by calling their destructor, but it can also be used to perform any clean up task that you may want and you can register appropriate a handler for that with atexit and then exit with success or with failure whatever values one	dev
audio_0_156629.wav	As you must be must have noted for the past few modules we have been discussing about active circuit design	dev
audio_0_130706.wav	So, you can also use this stack to pass data to a subroutine	dev
audio_0_12367.wav	So, come back to this example for example, in this case we have to determine your determine R R Thevenin right for this circuit, for look at that circuit there is no independent source in this circuit; that means, from your inspection you can make it that R Thevenin actually is equal to 0, because there is no independent sorry not R Thevenin sorry V Thevenin is equal to 0 right not R Thevenin V Thevenin is equal to 0 right	dev
audio_0_3480.wav	So, move to cut the flux now this is your horizontal position in this diagram right this is another diagram for this is the position the vertical position	dev

audio_0_158921.wav	so let us start with this	dev
audio_0_140023.wav	the telephone line is located directly below phase c	dev
audio_0_156717.wav	So given the S parameters of a circuit you simply evaluate K and delta and check whether K is greater than 1 or delta modulus is lesser than 1 then straight away you can say that the circuit is unconditionally stable	dev
audio_0_143424.wav	say this is your, this is your, that earth plane, assuming that this is zero potential and you have a conductor here, right, a uniform charge is uniformly distributed, right, assume that these are the positive charge, right	dev
audio_0_16948.wav	As soon as you close the switch, that right, so, capacitor acts like a short circuit; that means, a little bit understanding is required	dev
audio_0_133416.wav	So, if I print the address of mylib int as follows, we see that it has the value X7FT3014	dev
audio_0_161855.wav	now x one will come into the solution and it has to replace either a one or a two	dev
audio_0_134270.wav	So, what we needed to ensure was that we needed to ensure that this particular program is confined to a specific area	dev
audio_0_165950.wav	We can see that the dynamic binding is possible only for pointer and reference data type	dev
audio_0_167751.wav	If it is a domain error that is if is something on which you cannot do a cannot rise the power x to the power y then it errorno will become edom	dev
audio_0_12458.wav	Therefore your directly you can write i 2 is equal to 1 ampere, because only current source is there at current is in this mesh right	dev
audio_0_130929.wav	Essentially, we discussed a couple of countermeasures for the buffer overflow vulnerability	dev
audio_0_162367.wav	In this module and the next couple of ones, we will discuss in depth about type casting and cast operators in C++	dev
audio_0_110650.wav	So, port to is port 2 which is the IF port; port from is port 1 which is RF port	dev
audio_0_120272.wav	But, today the customer will make his or her own decision based on an extensive comparative value research presented to you, presented to him or her at the click of a button	dev
audio_0_115089.wav	So, we say that this one here is 1 so this will be 1 port, 2 port and this is a symmetrical port, so we can apply the concept of the symmetry	dev
audio_0_134772.wav	What the FANCI guarantees is that the algorithm has no false negatives that is if a Trojan is present in this particular IP then definitely a FANCI would actually detect it	dev
audio_0_103125.wav	So, I said that you will make this poly protein	dev
audio_0_102248.wav	And in these cases, focal adhesions were more prominent	dev
audio_0_12932.wav	So, 4 plus 4 it is 8 ohm and 8 volt source is there	dev
audio_0_171655.wav	For example, if you have sequence, can you tell a sequence	dev
audio_0_162817.wav	So, I have given the name of that as my n s	dev
audio_0_14824.wav	Independently will see how things are and here this is your thickness of this is 1 centimeter	dev
audio_0_154448.wav	Now suppose, the problem with this equation is this has elements of F1 and F2 are mixed on the LHS and RHS	dev
audio_0_118576.wav	The cylindrical magnetron is also called as multi cavity magnetron	dev
audio_0_19411.wav	So, DM, DL, that is direct material, direct labor and variable overheads are considered as variable costs	dev
audio_0_160912.wav	and then we move on to the third iteration, which is shown here, and in the third iteration the variable x two has replaced the variable x three	dev
audio_0_127578.wav	But when let us see if I if I reduce this and ifIf I change the factor to 1; that means, I have R 2 of 10 kilo ohm, I have R 1 of 10 kilo ohm in both the cases in both the cases if I change my R 2 in this particular case if I change my R 2 to 10 kilo ohms to 10 kilo ohms my gain would be my gain would be 1	dev
audio_0_18900.wav	So, the total of wages	dev
audio_0_145268.wav	and lastly, we will mention about the management of stress	dev
audio_0_28701.wav	we can write the expression for that: Y L equals	dev
audio_0_132606.wav	So before we go into what these attacks are, so let us have a brief background into what speculation means and what these terms connected to speculation actually do	dev
audio_0_127635.wav	Unity gain means what	dev
audio_0_23952.wav	So, that is why we have done it prior to this	dev
audio_0_158985.wav	so v two is negative, v two is negative, therefore it is infeasible and therefore we look at c j minus z j	dev
audio_0_123338.wav	So, this is experiment for input bias current	dev
audio_0_115335.wav	So, the at the output of this PLL we have a frequency component at one gigahertz and the level of this frequency component or the power level of this frequency component is minus 1	dev
audio_0_112807.wav	So, b 2 we locate a 1	dev
audio_0_167276.wav	Now, to use pointer, you will be familiar with this then I can have a variable i which is initialize to 20, I have a pointer i p point which I would use to point to i, which is int star i p and there is a special operator ampersand as you know which I can use with any variable to get the address of the memory location, where this variable will be stored	dev
audio_0_155746.wav	That means anytime power enters, signal enters port 1 by the time it reaches port 2, it is phase shifted by pie by 2 and same is the case for signal appearing at port 3	dev
audio_0_145222.wav	this is done for the oxygenation of the mind and different parts of the body	dev
audio_0_121676.wav	So, in service business, it is somewhat difficult and on the other hand, somewhat easier to create this value perception, which we will understand as we discuss during this session and in the following couple of sessions	dev
audio_0_131558.wav	So, essentially what would happen when this function completes execution is that this value 0804845C gets taken from the stack and placed into the instruction pointer and execution of the program will continue based on this particular value	dev
audio_0_101028.wav	So, if I want to ask the question	dev
audio_0_138448.wav	so that is up to you	dev
audio_0_20899.wav	But their difference is, how we supply the energy to the steam in that steam generator	dev
audio_0_166450.wav	So, what will have to get constructed for constructing a TA object is a TA object the faculty has to get constructed	dev
audio_0_156566.wav	In the previous module we have talked about ‘Multi section transformers’ and formula for input reflection percussions when a number of transmission line segments are connected in cascade	dev
audio_0_105545.wav	Mind you where in the limit state approach, the concept of modular ratio is out of the picture now when we are working purely on steel stresses and we are working on strains and then moving onto the steel stresses and the masonry stresses	dev
audio_0_168206.wav	We can use the exclamatory operator; overload the exclamation operator to mean that the sense being that exclamation operation is kind of a negation	dev
audio_0_110866.wav	However, we fabricated this because for one of the application desired noise figure was 2 dB and this gives lower than 2 dB, and nobody will of course, object if you give a lower noise figure	dev
audio_0_100940.wav	It’s a field of study where we try to understand how cells detect modify and respond to forces that arise under in vivo circumstances	dev
audio_0_152383.wav	So, we are calling this let say I naught this interval a, b which has this property or which ensures that there is a root in between a and b	dev
audio_0_163916.wav	So, len will produce this is the points are highlighted here for your reference and because of this call to str len with uninitialized values, we will get this kind of an error	dev
audio_0_147120.wav	because in communication, whatever we are talking, whether this is loaded with our feelings and emotions or not, that is equally important	dev
audio_0_164920.wav	Now, I have just put in the data members in public	dev
audio_0_172734.wav	So, it is very strict condition dollar 1 should be atom; so in this case we will get only atom records	dev
audio_0_27102.wav	So now let us write the equation for these symbols: y k plus 2, y k plus 1 and y k	dev
audio_0_131487.wav	We force the buffer to overflow and the payload which was present in the buffer to execute	dev
audio_0_114626.wav	So, where you can see that this is bent here this is bent like this here and this one over here, so the all the 3 ports are at the same level ok	dev
audio_0_137419.wav	but current angle is also taken because power factor is point eight, lagging	dev
audio_0_153371.wav	So, we are done with this term also here concerning this one we have direct result because s over s square plus a square and the a square is this 9 by 16 that means s 3 by 4 again	dev
audio_0_105962.wav	And if it does get transferred to the sides of the opening, what guarantees that action is actually what we are examining and the phenomenon that occurs is the arching action and under what conditions does this occur is what we are trying to examine	dev
audio_0_123579.wav	If I have a 2nd second order I will have 40 dB per decade, third order 60 dB per decade at f c equals to 0	dev
audio_0_173052.wav	So, x 1 equal to one, x2 equal to one, what is a f of x	dev
audio_0_122861.wav	So, from here R 11 and C 1 required for high pass stage to give a cut off frequency of 1 kilo hertz orare 10 kilo ohm and 5015 nano farad, whereile R 2, C 2 for a low pass filter isof cut off frequency of 30 kilo hertz andare 10 kilo ohm and 510 pico farad, right	dev
audio_0_117020.wav	So, we are putting this particular condition only at the center frequency, ok	dev
audio_0_101632.wav	So, for example, if a gel is very thin then cell responses on soft thin gels mimic that on thick and stiff substrates	dev
audio_0_159982.wav	x two is the second basic variable and remember, there are two equations	dev
audio_0_116496.wav	Now, you might wonder why we have chosen these parameters	dev
audio_0_110973.wav	We are separated out the gamma s terms	dev
audio_0_130501.wav	So, 4 volts we had to 4 volts is here right, where is 5 volts 5 volts is here right where is 6 volts 6 volts is here right	dev
audio_0_143253.wav	r right now, if you, if you now go for this, what you call this sending end voltage, now you have to find out sending end voltage and current for the nominal pi model and in the in the form of a, b, c, d parameters	dev
audio_0_3052.wav	You have to superimpose a star network on the existing delta network and equivalent and you have to find out equivalent resistances in the star network, so you go for delta to star conversion right	dev
audio_0_10175.wav	In the network shown in figure 3 the load connected across terminals AB consists of a variable resistance R L right	dev
audio_0_138475.wav	so it is line to neutral voltage	dev
audio_0_124420.wav	That means, silicon dioxide acts as a mask for the dopant	dev
audio_0_168039.wav	And I am holding that from a base class pointer, if the destructor is not virtual then it is simply looking at the base class part of the pointer	dev
audio_0_168825.wav	3 wheelers is a vehicle by two wheeler colon public vehicle	dev
audio_0_163183.wav	Now, what is viable	dev
audio_0_10576.wav	You have to determine we have to determine v c ah that is ah your this one then v x and i x for t greater than 0, these we have to find it out right	dev
audio_0_153314.wav	So, this is so called the Weierstrass approximation theorem and using this now we will move further	dev
audio_0_116462.wav	Now, you can see here most of the field is confined within this dielectric medium, but part of the field is actually in the air	dev
audio_0_115104.wav	So, let us say C 1 1 is the equivalent capacitance for this particular micro strip line and C 2 2 is the equivalent micro strip for this most of the time these two will identical, so we can say C 1 1 will be equal to C 2 2	dev
audio_0_113330.wav	This was the amplifier here	dev
audio_0_107379.wav	Once I do that I have different points estimated R1, R2, R3 and so on and if I were to connect all these points you are basically doing what is called a thrust line analysis	dev
audio_0_113634.wav	So that means, I can realize a capacitance using a small transmission line which is an open circuit	dev
audio_0_125591.wav	So, take a closer look at this slide	dev
audio_0_159226.wav	here i don't find the ratio because the pivot element is negative	dev
audio_0_163624.wav	So, the public attributes should be such that they do not decide the primarily the state of the object and the private methods cannot be the part of the behavior	dev
audio_0_25077.wav	So now what we are doing is we have added the cyclic prefix to the time domain samples, transmit them over the channel	dev
audio_0_10425.wav	When load unity power factor, it is purely resistive right	dev
audio_0_101720.wav	So, because you know the pillar displacement and if you know the stiffness material of this material then you can I exactly determine the force at each pillar	dev
audio_0_109251.wav	Of course, codes also put a limit on this value	dev
audio_0_129708.wav	What is sublimation	dev
audio_0_123079.wav	Now you see here below 151 Hertz, below 159 Hertz it will again start increasing	dev
audio_0_21133.wav	And therefore, there is excellent neutron economy compared to heterogeneous version there also very good in self controlling and can handle large increase in radioactivity, because of their large volume of a moderator coolant present said this; however, homogenous nuclear reactors are not very popular for commercial use because of their challenging kinetics and control issues	dev
audio_0_126951.wav	So, what exactly does input offset current means um	dev
audio_0_119538.wav	And therefore, they distribute the load on people accordingly, so that there is less chance of human error and as I said, there are one Dabba is returned, a fresh Dabba is picked up and similarly, one Dabba is picked up, which is already been used and is handed over for the delivery back to your home, so four handlings per day	dev
audio_0_18296.wav	If you have a vehicle you have to pay insurance on the vehicle and that insurance will be for one month or for one year	dev
audio_0_135085.wav	so here bus two it is, it is connected here	dev
audio_0_142830.wav	so assume that the three phasors are represented by represented by a, b, c and such that phase sequence a, b, c is called positive sequence	dev
audio_0_127642.wav	The unity gain amplifier is also used as the last stage in most of the amplifying circuits because it is a voltage follower and can be connected to any load which will draw lot of current, but the voltage at the input will be same at the output	dev
audio_0_173117.wav	So, all the 100 proteins you know the value of hydrophobicity right then you group the proteins right with which are very close in the values, then you move this numbers here and there	dev
audio_0_12730.wav	So, now now switch has moved here this part is not there, switch has moved from this position, so this part is not there	dev
audio_0_155133.wav	Now the resonator that we had discussed in the previous module using an open stub coupled with a gap, that is an example of a series inductor	dev
audio_0_16628.wav	Yhis is rms value, that is V m by root 2 and this one also this angle is minus 90 degree	dev
audio_0_142430.wav	so as this ensures that the overall voltage level remains the same order and that the minimum range of taps on both transformer is used	dev
audio_0_118392.wav	In this case, 2 is the sum port, 4 is the delta port represented in here	dev
audio_0_163097.wav	Now, how do you decide from	dev
audio_0_119826.wav	And the most important asset or a good source for creating customer satisfaction and customer relationship is when customer takes public action, when customer complaints	dev
audio_0_112149.wav	So, series component can be very easily put	dev
audio_0_161957.wav	so now we have written the problem in the sheet and we now look at the solver	dev
audio_0_155676.wav	There were 2 common types of Tees, one is what is called as E plane Tee	dev
audio_0_15598.wav	So, 1 2 3 4 5 5 different currents will either leave or will this thing this i 2 current is entering into the node, then i 6 current leaving this node, v by 3 dependent source are entering into the node, i 5 current leaving this node, another current that is if you take v 3 minus v 2 by 6 also in this direction leaving the node right so; that means, that means just for your understanding	dev
audio_0_18190.wav	Giving one more example, suppose you are doing portfolio management or you are doing buying and selling of shares and you have purchased a particular share for 1000	dev
audio_0_127258.wav	Now input impedance is infinite and typically greater than one mega ohm, but using FETs for input stage it can be increased to several mega ohms you see when we use field effect transistor the input impedance will increase to several 100s of mega ohms	dev
audio_0_117326.wav	You multiply with this impedance, now this become dimensional so in fact, it is sometimes easier to remember instead of a writing capital ABCD if you write in terms of let us say normalized value	dev
audio_0_105755.wav	Then it starts looking at reinforced concrete shear wall systems but I am now interested in looking at the load bearing masonry constructions and as you can see there are five different categories provided under this okay let's read each of them unreinforced masonry classified as unreinfor masonry where the design is prescribed as per is 1905 okay but without horizontal reinforced concrete seismic bands	dev
audio_0_105188.wav	So, then in that case what drives the retraction, retraction is driven by the lamella, you have myosin II in the lamella which is pulling the filaments back	dev
audio_0_127586.wav	Away And you have to understand that the output will depend output will depend the based on the gain of the amplifier	dev
audio_0_18406.wav	So our next assumption we have seen the first two assumption is that sales prices variable costs and total fixed costs do not vary within a relevant range again this assumption is true for a reasonable range next three assumptions are volume is the only cost driver so we do not take into account other cost changes like changes in the price levels or changes in the costs of some raw material, etc	dev
audio_0_122754.wav	And therefore, this is the front stage and then, behind this line of visibility, we have the back stage and the whole thing together is creates the, what we call the service blue print, the service flow chat or the service map	dev
audio_0_146096.wav	i will be talking about the kind of research we are doing in this particular field	dev
audio_0_147718.wav	so i have discussed lot related to group dynamics and there are certain points which you have to keep in minds	dev
audio_0_119707.wav	But, even the queue, before the queue enters the temple premises, the temple administration have done another engineers thing, that as soon as the pilgrims arrive at the Tirupati station and even before the claimed again to go to the Tirumal temple complex	dev
audio_0_128497.wav	Or it is a subtraction	dev
audio_0_19722.wav	So, a policy to achieve that target is prepared and that policy in quantitative terms is built up in the budget	dev
audio_0_168934.wav	In contrast to constructor, a destructor is not allowed any parameter	dev
audio_0_12115.wav	So, V 1 upon I 0 sin phi 0	dev
audio_0_165179.wav	But, any changes made to that will not be allowed by the compiler	dev
audio_0_114445.wav	The next is voltage monitor current monitor	dev
audio_0_137514.wav	you can write cosine: two k pi, two pi pi k or two k, you can write is equal to two k pi	dev
audio_0_173422.wav	We give the maximum values because why you give the maximum values	dev
audio_0_107733.wav	So, this is a standard procedure that is adopted and there are there are programs that are available that would assist you to do this then you can assemble the entire three dimensional model of the structure in this form of equivalent frames and carry out a gravity and a lateral load analysis like you would for a regular frame structure so you can see how the element the equivalent the equivalent in the the undeformed and the deformed geometry would actually look	dev
audio_0_121612.wav	This is the kind of average service time, if we maintain for breakfast delivery in the morning, the customer will be happy	dev
audio_0_122853.wav	So, what is given V RR is given as 1 kilohertz	dev
audio_0_163899.wav	From this, we take a very important lesson in terms of the order of initialization of data members in a class; the lesson is the order depends on the order of data members as they are listed in the class	dev
audio_0_122915.wav	F L you can say fc 1 fc 2 or f L also is nothing butis 1 upon 2 pi R 1 C 2, right	dev
audio_0_164680.wav	Please look up the manual or the book, for the details on these algorithms and start using them	dev
audio_0_162332.wav	So, in this two points you will find that answer that if we unary operator is prefix, then like this you simply write it, the signature will look something like this, which takes one the operand because it is unary of your type and it returns the operand that it had taken after the incrementation	dev
audio_0_113393.wav	So, what you do, you locate this particular thing on the smith chart	dev
audio_0_12982.wav	Now, once you have done this then this 6 ohm and 12 ohm both are in parallel	dev
audio_0_2686.wav	So, the same thing is obtained from this equation also, 1 minus e raised to the power of minus 12 by 60, wherein the 12 is converted into hours; that is why we are dividing by 60, multiplied by 0	dev
audio_0_162363.wav	With this we come to the close of this module where, here we have introduced the operator overloading and we have explained different rules and exceptions for operator overloading	dev
audio_0_171101.wav	You can take a five or more; depending upon the properties which are important for the binding with the target	dev
audio_0_151117.wav	And if we see that this dot product here is the magnitude of this delta f, magnitude of b and cos theta	dev
audio_0_127663.wav	Negative	dev
audio_0_134459.wav	Now the states T1, T2, T3 and T4 are compromised and therefore the user 1 and user 2 are compromised, so what we see from this dependency graph is that a single vulnerability in a particular process in the web server can compromise all users and all services that that web server supports	dev
audio_0_169476.wav	And we have shown that they are four operators of const cast, static cast, reinterpret cast and dynamic cast are sufficient to solve any of your cast requirements	dev
audio_0_104157.wav	So, k * delta d is the force exerted by the cell at a focal adhesion	dev
audio_0_172384.wav	So, experimentally we know that using different assys right	dev
audio_0_157779.wav	When there is control, the current is discontinuous	dev
audio_0_136756.wav	then cos theta one, one plus magnitude v one	dev
audio_0_127779.wav	We can also combine what we have seen further; that we can also combine this RC filters to form another type of filters that can block or severely attenuate a given band of frequencies right, between two cut off frequencies	dev
audio_0_170663.wav	So, this class we discuss in 3D structures right	dev
audio_0_1951.wav	So, similar main square error, error could be, similarly we can define mean square error in various other contexts	dev
audio_0_120408.wav	So, in service we do not move physical products; obviously, it may need some accessory movement	dev
audio_0_127878.wav	lLearn this video, read this video, when I say read this video what does that mean,	dev
audio_0_102722.wav	This blunt tip is used exhaustively for proving mechanical properties of tissues, cells and tissues soft samples while this sphere	dev
audio_0_136219.wav	so base m v a: we have chosen hundred, but generator base different	dev
audio_0_164739.wav	So, that gets invoked and finally, in terms of the h function again you have the same behaviour because they are not virtual functions	dev
audio_0_152027.wav	So, this only the derivative term will come extra with respect to x because of this second derivative	dev
audio_0_149171.wav	before this, we have dealt with certain aspects of presentation, ah, and what is very significant in this particular context is that we need to know how the image component and the text component get integrated	dev
audio_0_115076.wav	And that is transmitting through the antenna now how do we ensure that it is exactly 20 watt or it is less or more	dev
audio_0_107588.wav	And this is an important information primarily because when you are doing assessment of existing buildings, if you can get this one information, you are better place than having no information for an existing building	dev
audio_0_155036.wav	So, we saw that of the 4 S parameters associated with the 2 port network, if we just get information about S 11 magnitude, the phasor or the argument of S11 and argument of S22 which I call theta 2 and the argument of S11, I am calling theta 1	dev
audio_0_154085.wav	That is we have only one electromagnetic wave which satisfy the TEM conditions	dev
audio_0_16839.wav	So, that means, ah your if I make the circuit once like this, it is something like this hope it is understandable to you	dev
audio_0_106918.wav	There are of course limits and it will be instructive to examine what these limits are	dev
audio_0_20221.wav	And therefore, different safety measures were taken from very early generation plants itself; still there were quite a few actually I should say there are three quite prominent nuclear accidents, which happened over the over last 65 70 years of nuclear history	dev
audio_0_157581.wav	So, I am going to show as though one is closed	dev
audio_0_134757.wav	Now consider a slight modification to this multiplexer, what we assume is that there is now not just two select lines but there are in fact 65 select lines, the first two are S1 and S2 which we have seen as before and besides that we have 63 other select lines which are going to a logic over here which produces either 0 or 1	dev
audio_0_749.wav	You need to find out the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this covariance matrices	dev
audio_0_130601.wav	So, initially we will have a beta greater than one and then it becomes a beta equal to 1, right	dev
audio_0_141332.wav	so what you, what one can do, is that when you are trying to converted to per unit form, then simple thing is that v s is equal to a real voltage, is equal to say v s b, v s per unit voltage of the secondary side, into v s b	dev
audio_0_171383.wav	So, here also we know that ATP compound inhibitors here also we know out conformation	dev
audio_0_109414.wav	Either you increase the permissible stresses in your calculations by 33% in this earthquake plus gravity load combinations or you have the possibility of taking that to the other side of the equation and reduce your loads to 75% and continue to use 100% of the permissible stress, not 133 percent	dev
audio_0_124238.wav	When we apply force, there is a change in the voltage output change is in the form of voltage	dev
audio_0_119700.wav	This has it is own challenges and it is own advantages and we will discuss it little bit more later on when we discuss the queuing	dev

audio_0_13750.wav	So, it is 18	dev
audio_0_164252.wav	So, with that if we have done a (Refer Time: 02:47) specialization, then the derived class, certainly cannot access the private members of the base class because the derived class is, by definition in another class	dev
audio_0_109258.wav	And in this particular case, the code uses a value of 0	dev
audio_0_104620.wav	So, one approach which authors, which lot of researchers have taken used to use a strategy where populations are separated based on that deformability or deformability or size	dev
audio_0_130669.wav	Now, the question is how does it come back	dev
audio_0_167196.wav	Now, any structure variable can be initialized like a simple variable; and the notation is very similar to the way we initialized arrays	dev

audio_0_164281.wav	Therefore, this print function cannot compile, it cannot work	dev
audio_0_126410.wav	So, when I talk suddenly about virtual ground, you do not have to go back and see what is virtual ground right, because you have already seen and you have already know what exactly virtual ground is	dev
audio_0_132348.wav	Now as we know ptmalloc2 is present in the gilibc library which is linked with all standard C or C++ programs that you write on a typical Linux system	dev
audio_0_109482.wav	So, in this case, we could, the level of shear stress is low, we could choose to go with either with or without web shear reinforcement and look at the estimate of m by VD first and then the fv and fv max that we must consider with and without web shear reinforcement	dev
audio_0_148956.wav	and the next point is that, if you are talking about all these things, how are they relevant in the context of soft skills	dev
audio_0_173263.wav	Then you can see the nature of common ancestors, alright if you make a tree you can see which will be the common ancestor	dev

audio_0_23128.wav	I will give you a moment to think about what can you do other way round opposite of, of course you can come out with your own ideas but I am just trying to help you over here	dev
audio_0_125569.wav	So, Sitaram is with us and now if you see the screen if you see the screen, what we are doing	dev
audio_0_118534.wav	And as we discussed earlier the frequency of operation of klystron amplifier is up to 50 gigahertz, whereas the frequency of operation of a travelling wave tube amplifier is up to 100 gigahertz	dev
audio_0_165891.wav	So this is the basic concept of the function pointer that you know	dev
audio_0_127288.wav	Now, 3 thus the input bias current can be defined as the current flowing into each of the 2 input terminals, thus the input bias current can be defined as the current flowing into each of the 2 input terminals when they are biased at the same level when they are biased at the same level that is when the op amp is balanced, all right	dev
audio_0_133869.wav	So, note first that since or every encryptor there is also a decryptor at the output the results should always be correct and secondly also note that this obfuscation of the inputs would prevent the cheat code from activating the trigger	dev
audio_0_118539.wav	And the last difference is the wave in klystron amplifier is non propagative; whereas the wave in travelling wave tube is propagative	dev
audio_0_2884.wav	So, I mean here also you can put it, but not shown here I did not show it here right, I did not show it here you can put it right	dev
audio_0_13195.wav	And now if you sketch del your d v by d t, so it is a delta function	dev
audio_0_26075.wav	We are saying going to use capital N equal to four symbols	dev
audio_0_131310.wav	So, this gets 0 gets inverted to 1 then 0 and then 1 again and then there is a feedback	dev
audio_0_134209.wav	Also, while creating the page the operating system would need to specify other aspects such as the operating mode whether it is 32 bit or 64 bits	dev

audio_0_17791.wav	As per the rule for calculation of selling price, it is given that management desires a margin of 20% on cost of sales	dev
audio_0_10350.wav	So, here loss and the total loss is so, magnitude that I 2 square into R 1 plus your magnitude here I 2 magnitude into R 2, this is a total copper loss right real power loss	dev
audio_0_129262.wav	So, we will measure V1, V2 and Vout, and from that, we can measure the differential gain, alright	dev
audio_0_138937.wav	i l is useful measure of transmission line capacity as it indicates a loading where the lines reactive requirements are small right	dev
audio_0_141047.wav	and for delta side it is either a, b, b, c or c a	dev
audio_0_128096.wav	It is possible for a semi conductor to conduct electron but, we have to give some energy	dev
audio_0_166143.wav	So, since these are pointers if I have to call them at this slide, the two actual parameters a, and b will have to be passed as the address of a, and address of b	dev
audio_0_115361.wav	6 and the amplifier is drawing around 100 milliamperes of current which is the correct operating point and now we will observe the output of this amplifier on the spectrum analyzer	dev
audio_0_125277.wav	40 it is in 2,000	dev
audio_0_150126.wav	So, we have 1 over s power gamma plus 1 which is coming from here and we have e power minus u u power gamma and that is exactly the definition we have for the gamma function	dev
audio_0_130375.wav	Why we are not using VGSS is because here see substrate is there , here the source is there right and we have connected the substrate and source like this we apply negative to source positive to gate, but we always say VGS we never say VGSS or VGB because source and substrate are connected internally	dev
audio_0_111622.wav	So, from here make this quantity to 0, then we will get fc is equal to this which we can simplify as 1 upon 2 root mu epsilon under root m by a whole square plus n by b whole square or we can write it as v divided by 2 under root m by a whole square plus n by b whole square	dev
audio_0_22504.wav	So all the teachers can also sort of plug into the ecosystem	dev
audio_0_125804.wav	What does high pass filter means	dev
audio_0_108434.wav	And fundamentally, if you have dynamic loading, we are considering this behavior on a static loading, you can have conditions in dynamic loading where the displacement may go to a state corresponding to the limiting condition that this expression gives, but then can spring back and continue to support the lateral forces	dev
audio_0_169683.wav	So, in your program you will have typically have two kinds of header files; the header files that you have written and the header files that the stand has come from the standard library	dev
audio_0_21537.wav	This is a solution for design thinking course we are teaching on NPTEL	dev
audio_0_142585.wav	this is known with this data net bus injected power, pi plus jqi at all buses are known after the other than the slack bus, if it is, i mean if all buses are pq buses, right	dev
audio_0_18920.wav	So, dash in January, 1000 in February and so on	dev
audio_0_168685.wav	So, you can see that it is in contrast to using global functions, now this method invocation or member functions are allowing us to put together the data as well as the operations as well as the methods or member all that I need to do with the data put to give them together into one unified bundle	dev
audio_0_3039.wav	So, it is not 4 terminal; it is a 3 terminal right and resistances are given say R 1 R 2 R 3 if you if you draw like this, we call star connected right	dev
audio_0_133841.wav	Now beyond this epoch period we are not certain whether a hardware Trojan may get triggered or not	dev
audio_0_125773.wav	So, we can have by taking square root; by taking square root of this particular equation	dev
audio_0_106609.wav	However, considering these difficulties and considering the fact that you have hollow blocks which are a good solution for reducing the weight of floor slabs or weight of any construction, hollow blocks used as a part of a hybrid reinforced floor system is common	dev
audio_0_27934.wav	So basically Iím going to write this as H, H transpose	dev
audio_0_4635.wav	In that first one figure 7 a so in that case your you can make it you what you call numerator and denominator you multiply by a	dev
audio_0_152369.wav	So, basically these four approximations algorithm will be talking about in this in two lectures	dev
audio_0_122473.wav	This block that you see here need arousal, evaluation, etc, it is actually a more expanded format of the AIDA model, but there are some nuances here which are particular to the services domain	dev
audio_0_124287.wav	We have already seen, where we can make inter digitated electrodes or we can see piezo resistive micro cantilevers, we have also seen types of substrate	dev
audio_0_158838.wav	so the five goes and becomes five plus theta	dev

audio_0_132185.wav	One way of bypassing ASLR is if the attacker determines either by brute force or by special attacks known as timing attacks, where the attacker finds out where in the entire virtual address space of the process is the library actually loaded	dev
audio_0_115793.wav	Basically a low pass filter is a filter which passes low frequencies	dev
audio_0_170245.wav	So, we will keep another call member function which takes the name of a person and makes the call	dev
audio_0_12108.wav	So, your what you call that Wattmeter reading is actually in that case wattmeter, this side is open that is secondary is open	dev
audio_0_144891.wav	i have come up with five ideas	dev
audio_0_24733.wav	If you look at it from one point of view, they are actually competing and hence you would have to look at it from both sides and see to that, that both of them, both of these guys are satisfied	dev
audio_0_166375.wav	So, the consequence of that is a next statement is since it does not have at this pointer, it cannot know the address of the data members of the object, because it is not referring to any objects	dev
audio_0_103077.wav	So, on and so 4th, I am not drawing all 15 domains, but you will have these multiple peaks, which might have comparable lengths, comparable forces so and so forth	dev
audio_0_17473.wav	There are four possible fees	dev
audio_0_14970.wav	So, it has you have been asked to find out the voltage across the 5 ohm resistance right	dev
audio_0_106850.wav	Now, there is a problem because if you take away water from mortar you are going to interfere with the hydration processes of the cement in mortar	dev
audio_0_158477.wav	so this is the column and we would like to look at this least cost position in the chosen column, which is this position	dev
audio_0_168926.wav	So, this ensures that the data that was dynamically held up in this data member of the stack class can be released at this point	dev
audio_0_157679.wav	Again for the next two cycles I am going to keep it on and for the next one cycle I am not going to keep it on at all	dev
audio_0_156425.wav	Although, both lower than this frequency and above lower than 1 GHz and above 30 GHz also, the principles that we study in this course can be applied but usually this is taken as the boundary of the microwave engineering	dev
audio_0_161911.wav	now we have to write the second row now to do that, we have this variable x two coming here, so this should have a zero here	dev
audio_0_100103.wav	Then with a need to decide whether we can exercise better control over them or otherwise mitigate their update	dev
audio_0_101670.wav	So, in this case the polymer or the photoresist is more soluble after light exposure	dev
audio_0_162916.wav	This a basic use of using; as such, you have been seeing this in the whole code so far I had mentioned at the very beginning that, we will keep on writing this because all of the standard library symbols are in the namespace Std	dev
audio_0_28288.wav	So removing this Inter Symbol Interference, essentially removing this ISI Inter Symbol Interference, is basically what is termed as equalisation	dev
audio_0_23050.wav	So the jogger is in place while the path is moving, typically a jogger moves and the path remains stationary	dev
audio_0_132207.wav	So, since we have requested for 120 bytes and there is an additional 8 bytes allocated for every malloc request, so what we would expect to see is that the size of this chunk is 128 bytes	dev
audio_0_20732.wav	So, these beings out towards the end of this particular module where you have discussed different effects of different parameters on reactivity	dev

audio_0_11511.wav	Therefore, my current will be your what you call 50 root 2 by 10 root 2 is equal to 5 ampere this is my rms value of the current right if if this is my rms value if you multiply by root 2 it will be 7	dev
audio_0_20893.wav	Now, there can be 2 types of this high stream energy or high velocity energy generation we can divide in 2 categories; one like this hydroelectric or wind where we either directly get the kinetic energy or convert potential energy into kinetic energy	dev
audio_0_29157.wav	so let us say that it has been attacked and the switch is down	dev
audio_0_16636.wav	Then, this is root 2 then omega L this actually is equal to omega L angle 90 degree right	dev
audio_0_153881.wav	So then you know we can see we the input and output the incident or reflected waves are given as B Ns and A Ns	dev
audio_0_156503.wav	Now this what is this beta	dev
audio_0_112662.wav	Now generally speaking a manufacturer at microwave frequency does not give h parameters, but it actually gives S parameter	dev
audio_0_124375.wav	We can use this as a gate oxide or tunneling oxides	dev
audio_0_159121.wav	so there is only one candidate with the ratio one by eight, and variable x two is the only candidate and that will enter	dev
audio_0_119185.wav	So, up to 10'o clock is a time when they will gather customer's and store them	dev

audio_0_24638.wav	I wonder if that is the truth but that’s what he told me, so I will take it at face value	dev
audio_0_28367.wav	so what we have is basically we have your estimate, which is distributed as a Gaussian random variable	dev
audio_0_11595.wav	So, you can you can you can easily ah you are what you call you can easily find out what will be your your what will be your this thing ah power right	dev
audio_0_170513.wav	So, here the next one is tertiary structure	dev
audio_0_105733.wav	And then you have dual systems where you have a shear wall system, in reinforced concrete shear wall system, but you also have a moment resisting frame in that system	dev

audio_0_140044.wav	square is equal to eight point four, one meter	dev
audio_0_151016.wav	What was interesting here, we have seen that if f is defined only in 0 to 8, so in earlier case, when the function is defined in 8 to 8 and it is given that it is an odd function or we notice that it is an even function, then the calculations can be simplified to have representations which will carry only cosine term or only sine term	dev
audio_0_1050.wav	Another feature of the studio geometry that this plane induced homography or you can find out whether it is compatible to a fundamental matrix or not	dev
audio_0_108435.wav	So, we will examine how the force displacement curve finally looks, but then basically we are looking at distribution at cracking in the cross section to estimate the moment and from the moment the force and then when let's say one half of the wall is cracked or three quarters of the wall is cracked and finally we look at the condition where the rectangular stress block is used and so the moment at each stage from the geometry is available to us which will then be useful to plug in the corresponding values of x and the corresponding value of the reaction force gives us different points on the force displacement curve	dev

audio_0_115153.wav	1 2 let us say 1 one can see that from here if you look at corresponding value of even mode and odd mode impedances they are relatively higher compare to if you look at the Z even mode and odd mode impedances corresponding to w by d equal to 1	dev
audio_0_134571.wav	Thus, there is a limitation to what the attacker can do	dev
audio_0_11151.wav	So, angle of the voltage this is first quadrant	dev
audio_0_105369.wav	Because the water cement ratio in the high slump concrete when you are pumping it is much higher than what it is inside the cavity because the walls will start absorbing the water in the grout and what you would finally get is possibly a stronger grout if there if the too much water is not absorbed	dev
audio_0_157939.wav	So that is the reason why we are drawing it in the negative direction	dev
audio_0_168154.wav	Now if I provide the implementation, also its purity does not go away, because I am saying that it is it is a pure function	dev

audio_0_26015.wav	These are basically your, these are basically the symbols, or the modulated symbols, loaded on to the various subcarriers and that is what you are getting back after you perform the FFT and naturally, the only remaining thing is the noise	dev
audio_0_16904.wav	So, that is why, your what you call that no DC voltage source is present	dev
audio_0_165243.wav	There is a function which takes a call, takes a parameter by reference and returns that same parameter by reference	dev
audio_0_125046.wav	So, what is the gain	dev
audio_0_101214.wav	So, these are fibronectin islands and they generated various geometries different shapes triangles, rectangles and circles, and they also altered the sizes of these	dev
audio_0_2407.wav	So, you have to ensure that even though there is a hamming between the inner and outer members, there is going to be some kind of a waxing in the inner member which would prevent such a thing from happening	dev
audio_0_12614.wav	Now, for when this as soon as the switch is closed, for t greater than 0 that U t is equal to 1 that is why this U t you put here here it is written	dev
audio_0_145321.wav	ok, now this becomes a very interesting, exiting, challenging thing, and most of us are interested in such a dimension of non verbal communication as well, because you see that a very often the important thing is to find out what somebody is actually thinking	dev
audio_0_22.wav	So this is the interpretation	dev

audio_0_149629.wav	So, here 1 over epsilon and then here we have e power minus s t over s with minus sign it is integration and that will be integrate will be set for the limit a to a plus epsilon	dev
audio_0_125098.wav	Now in the next module, let us see how non inverting amplifier would work alright	dev
audio_0_112338.wav	So, name it as r out and r in and for Teflon again give the same thickness and then this is minus t	dev
audio_0_127302.wav	But if I want to measure input offset current then it becomes even easier because formula becomes even easier just subtraction of I b 1 and I b 2, I b 1 and I b 2, right	dev
audio_0_27249.wav	so basically, this gives the least squares or the maximum likelihood estimate of this parameter vector H bar, and this is also the maximum likelihood estimate	dev
audio_0_131496.wav	So, lets open this particular C code and open it over here and what we see is two functions, one is a function which takes three parameters a, b and c and it does some simple manipulations on a buffer	dev
audio_0_107314.wav	5%	dev
audio_0_125016.wav	You see that the output is 180 degree phase shift to the input signal, isn't it	dev
audio_0_125012.wav	So, what is the output	dev
audio_0_24044.wav	So, I am bringing this to you who are viewing this video	dev
audio_0_160435.wav	because when we actually solved the assignment problem by the method that we saw, the method that we saw is called the hungarian algorithm	dev
audio_0_159816.wav	so v one is the slack variable associated with the first dual constraint and v two is the slack variable associated with the second dual constraint	dev
audio_0_164610.wav	In Q sort, we just specified the number of elements; here we pass the pointer to the first element, after point of attention	dev
audio_0_162089.wav	So naturally in this stack code the initialization to top remains same, but we now also have to initialize the array pointer which we do by dynamically allocating it	dev
audio_0_16991.wav	Whatever it come, that is your and then, then then the equivalent circuit of only this part plus minus this is 100 volt and this is that your resistance, right	dev
audio_0_15747.wav	So, this is equation 7	dev
audio_0_159862.wav	now that is shown by another x that is coming here	dev
audio_0_107337.wav	A 34 meter high wall would be how many stories	dev
audio_0_13951.wav	I told you that as i 1 is minus 6 means it is your what you call it is flowing to your in this direction , ah that entering in ah it is minus 6 means it is these direction right; that means, it is these direction current is current is flowing this direction then we entering into the voltage I mean plus terminal; that means, this 10 voltage source actually is observing power, because when it is leaving the plus terminal it is supplied when is entering the plus terminal it is your power observed	dev
audio_0_136546.wav	right now, using equation fourteen, that, coming from that amperes law, h x, at a distance such that your h x is equal to i x upon two, pi x	dev
audio_0_156841.wav	If I am using an open stub then I would need a length of starting from the open end so then I would need this distance	dev
audio_0_106090.wav	One of the first constraints may be depending on the zone in which you are constructing, the earthquake zone in which you are constructing, you also have limitations on the motor type that you will use	dev
audio_0_143474.wav	so that means you have to find out the total reactive power in megavar supplied by the line capacitance	dev
audio_0_157183.wav	So we will be looking at each of these circuit configurations with variety of inputs and different kinds of outputs we want	dev
audio_0_122146.wav	And a brand needs to be evolving it cannot be static point we discussed when we discussed proposition, value proposition that you need to be ahead of your competition and definitely respond to competition their value proposition	dev
audio_0_15737.wav	So, it is p is equal to dw by dt where p is the power in watts right w is the energy in joules right and t is the time in second	dev
audio_0_3432.wav	So, that x 2 dash can be altogether neglected	dev
audio_0_122766.wav	All this process points understands and the targets we have to set up	dev
audio_0_101826.wav	So, this shows that having low lamin A to B ratio actually helps the nuclei to migrate and during the migration there is significant amount of change in nuclear shape, which correlates with the migration process ok	dev
audio_0_14227.wav	So, we have taken I s c in this direction	dev
audio_0_162234.wav	You can say operator delete which is a corresponding operator function and pass p as a parameter to the operator delete function	dev
audio_0_105970.wav	However, there are some geometrical constraints which have to be adhered to if this has to occur or not	dev
audio_0_100668.wav	So, in the last class we introduced this abstraction of imagining the cell as a tent	dev
audio_0_28999.wav	so see, even after stopping this program, data which was previously stored maintains there	dev
audio_0_2679.wav	5, that is 30 minutes, 12 by 60, because we are converting that 12 minutes into 60	dev
audio_0_154496.wav	So if we come back to the slides on the written slides you know just like so noise measure of a stage is defined like this	dev
audio_0_156969.wav	This minus is going to be connected through this to the minus here	dev
audio_0_151874.wav	If we take the inverse transform of this one, so this was the second question of in this problem that what is the Laplace transform of this function which is actually after this evaluation we do see that there is such a term exist in this Laplace transform of error function of k over square root t	dev
audio_0_119304.wav	And even they are as well will see in the next lecture we will like to focus on our existing customers, our existing relations to leverage a low cost entry with other low cost entry into a new activities	dev
audio_0_108473.wav	, low strength units should not be used for reinforced masonry at all	dev
audio_0_133215.wav	The reason why we require some secure boot is the following, so let us say that we are having an application that uses the secure world	dev
audio_0_154022.wav	Similarly if you have a signal flow graph diagram like this	dev
audio_0_158414.wav	if i am able to get a and b that satisfy these two conditions	dev
audio_0_146939.wav	to go to the details, you look at this figure, you see, look at it	dev
audio_0_108431.wav	That will determine what the compressed length is and so we get the entire distribution post cracking up to a condition where x is equal to delta and you get zero resistance in the system	dev
audio_0_107694.wav	So, we were talking about possible modeling approaches and one of the more popular and appropriate approaches for modeling and analysis, particularly seismic analysis of masonry constructions is what is referred to as equivalent frame modeling where the masonry construction is considered as an equivalent frame	dev
audio_0_24891.wav	First activity would probably be him having to take out his pen	dev

audio_0_133219.wav	A typical chain of trust looks something like this	dev
audio_0_3482.wav	Now, at this position we will find so you can say it is a neutral position at that time this is called one side of the coil, this is other side of the coil, this is the back side, and this is your it is coming out	dev
audio_0_135916.wav	the overall system stability can be improved by appropriate control schemes, such as turbine valve control, fast fault clearing time, appropriate your appropriate excitation systems and facts devices, that is, flexible transmissions devices, right, but those are the thing that you can be improved	dev
audio_0_106124.wav	So, this is something that we are agreeable upon	dev
audio_0_17241.wav	So, how much is PV ratio	dev
audio_0_155451.wav	So that, you can do by drawing the input stability circle and then see whether the gamma is that you have obtained using this equation indeed lies in the stable region	dev
audio_0_168843.wav	As we go from mobile to smart phone we find yet some more functionalities coming in and in that way the phones form a very nice small specialization generalization hierarchy	dev
audio_0_120632.wav	So, the exchange of value is taking place on the basis of solution and service and not on the basis of transfer of ownership	dev
audio_0_116450.wav	So, for TM 1 0 mode as I mentioned there is a 1 half wavelength variation along the length	dev
audio_0_147418.wav	so group means they have a goal in their group to achieve and how they are and how the groups are formed and they are behaving each other and communicating with each other, what kind of relationships they are having with each other to achieve that goal	dev
audio_0_116559.wav	So, this is the e plane pattern this is the h plane pattern do not get confused it shows here E theta in phi equal to 0 degree plane	dev
audio_0_141276.wav	that means, ah, when you are buying a generator or transformers, right, or motor, you will see that on the name plate that m v a rating is available, and per unit reactance also, it is available, right, in general, per unit impedance, right	dev
audio_0_12895.wav	So, let me so before everything is there at the bottom, but before that I am just trying to explain that how we actually obtained it	dev
audio_0_135702.wav	this power curve always above this graphs	dev
audio_0_15313.wav	Earlier I saw I 1 I one because for ideal transfer all these things are neglected	dev
audio_0_119200.wav	So, this is where actually the red part is much bigger and it was always difficult to match this peak demand with respect to capacity available, because if you created a huge stadium to meet that peak demand, rest of the time it will be lying vacant	dev
audio_0_137021.wav	so this is actually your	dev
audio_0_3174.wav	So, we have to your what you call the star is given	dev
audio_0_28535.wav	remember: this parameter h corresponds to the temperature or pressure	dev

audio_0_157549.wav	This sequence you guys must have gotten used to now, hopefully, right	dev
audio_0_134746.wav	So, what we see in this is that in most of the rows in this truth table the trigger has a value of 0 exactly when the values of A0 to A31 has this specific 0xDEADBEEF input then you have a value of trigger to be 1, in all other cases or trigger has a value of 0	dev
audio_0_107592.wav	Now what is flat wise	dev
audio_0_155844.wav	In some cases it may not be possible to obtain for example if our input stability circle be like this, it does not really touch any constant resistance circle	dev

audio_0_123244.wav	This terminal and this terminal or this terminal and ground	dev
audio_0_117838.wav	Let us look at what are the different types of microwave equipment	dev
audio_0_156570.wav	Now the interesting thing about this formula is that gamma in at theta is equal to 5 upon 2 is zero and D gamma in upon D theta K, or K between one and N minus one, is also equal to zero	dev
audio_0_142310.wav	so this current direction, all other will remain same, but this one, i one will become zero	dev
audio_0_111264.wav	So, I recommend that you keep the cell phone at an arms length so, you can reach the cell phone in emergency	dev
audio_0_127693.wav	So, it is limited to provide sufficient gain; this is an example which we have seen	dev
audio_0_119939.wav	Most commonly employing time based performances, this is the transient perishable nature of service to bring about desired results in recipient themselves	dev

audio_0_117621.wav	So, here the operating point is chosen away from the cutoff point	dev
audio_0_165145.wav	How do I check if it is a same object	dev
audio_0_173640.wav	And the another one this is slightly used genetic algorithm right the genetic algorithm is a stochastic algorithm to sample the data right they mainly used in the global optimization issues	dev
audio_0_164987.wav	So, this is a object which is 2	dev
audio_0_151114.wav	And if you make this dot product, so we can find out the directional derivative at that point, sorry, at the point 1,1,1 in the direction of this i plus j plus k	dev
audio_0_136695.wav	so thats why in your com, in your computation, that first you compute this term: p two minus jq, two upon y two, two and y two, one upon y two, two and y two, three upon y two, two, all capital, right	dev
audio_0_21242.wav	We need two boundary conditions to identify the value of this two coefficients	dev
audio_0_133258.wav	Also what is required is a string argument to this system function, so we will require string such as /bin/sh or /bin/bash, which is a string comprising of an executable	dev
audio_0_151210.wav	So, for instance, we want to represent this function here f x which is given by x and 2pi minus x in the range pi to 2pi	dev
audio_0_132626.wav	On the other hand if r0 is not equal to r1 then the 0 flag is reset or in other words the 0 flag is equal to 0 and this particular check would cause the program counter to jump to this label and start to execute from here, or in other words what we see over here is a value of 0 flag set to 1 would cause these instructions to be executed	dev
audio_0_136750.wav	this value you got for v three, one	dev
audio_0_13178.wav	So, it is a gate function	dev
audio_0_114270.wav	And in the first cavity the velocity of these electrons will be modulated by the input RF signal present there in the first cavity	dev
audio_0_110661.wav	If you apply ok, and if you simulate, you get this performance for noise figure	dev

audio_0_20170.wav	So, in a nutshell all this things put up, come in the previous module only, but still I am mentioning about them in this particular module just to let you know, what effect radiation can have	dev
audio_0_116712.wav	So, people living in that particular direction will receive very high radiation compared to other people	dev
audio_0_13300.wav	So, this is my 90 degree, this is my one 80 degree, and this point is 270 degree	dev
audio_0_103656.wav	So, instead of flowing through the entire artery blood flow is restricted and this plaque is made up of multiple constituents including fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances	dev

audio_0_2276.wav	And if there is some kind of deviation when the PI of the parts inspection has a responsibility added responsibility to go and do process audit at the vendor end and seeing what is the reason for the non compliance and trying to remove that so that comes realistically into the system and the system get does not get altered much	dev
audio_0_153349.wav	So, since this Laplace integral does not read the values at the discontinuities	dev
audio_0_166157.wav	So, what I am doing is basically since call by value will not allow me to make changes to the actual parameter, I am sending their addresses out and remotely I am allowing the swap function to use the address to actually refer to the actual parameters, and then make the change	dev
audio_0_106821.wav	Typically, if you take a ratio of the modulus of rupture by this test to the compressive strength of the unit, you would get a ratio somewhere between 10 to 30 percent and that's a typical range	dev
audio_0_141722.wav	point seven, eight, seven four kilo ampere, right, because we keep here all this things in your, what you call k v r is equal to nine ohm	dev
audio_0_155097.wav	So, the construction of that is like this	dev
audio_0_13011.wav	So, 4 plus 4 into this current 5 ampere it is 5 right	dev
audio_0_163013.wav	We have seen that operators can be overloaded and now we know that the Allocation operator new and the De allocation operator delete are actually operators themselves, having corresponding operator functions and therefore, they can be also be overloaded	dev
audio_0_112817.wav	So, a 2 is gamma L times b 2 and a 1 is given by this expression here	dev
audio_0_3167.wav	So, this is your a just hold down this is a b and c right this is T network the star network R 1, R 2 and your R 3 all are given 10, 20 and 30 ohm right	dev
audio_0_24620.wav	So I’ll give you a very very simple way to test this, also graphically you can represent this	dev
audio_0_169621.wav	So, the value of DrawArrr go dot gCode turns out to be DrawCir, whereas if I put go dot gCode as Rec, if it is a rectangle structure, then go dot gCode here is 1	dev
audio_0_17688.wav	They have given that company wants to earn a profit of 1 lakh and there will be an increase in production overheads by 3 lakhs	dev

audio_0_159387.wav	in fact, if we, if we've went to the very first iteration, instead of entering this ten though we have consistently entered the one with the largest c j minus z j now none with the positive c j minus z j is actually a candidate that can enter	dev
audio_0_165838.wav	And we had discussed about this casting issue, because particularly when we discuss dynamic binding over class hierarchies then regularly we need to perform a different kinds of up cast	dev
audio_0_110309.wav	So, let us see what ABCD parameters are related to	dev
audio_0_19440.wav	Now based on these, what do you feel	dev
audio_0_20640.wav	Now, we remember that natural uranium generally comprises of three different isotopes; Uranium 235 about 0	dev
audio_0_156891.wav	Had it been resistive load, I would have gotten the voltage only until here because the current would also stop exactly at that point	dev
audio_0_129475.wav	So, saturation region let us see after the negative resistance region which saw an increase in current comes the saturation region	dev
audio_0_168811.wav	So, this is the basic concept of ISA relationship which we want to bring in in the context of C++ programming	dev
audio_0_110101.wav	So, you see the disparity in the values of FND which do not give us clarity on how physically the phenomenon is occurring with the cracking in the brick unit leading to loss of confinement in the motor causing crushing failure in the motor itself	dev
audio_0_128276.wav	So, you can see how silicon substrate looks like and we will also see several techniques that are used to fabricate this integrated circuits	dev
audio_0_170299.wav	The smart phones typically are characterized by having a touchscreen	dev
audio_0_23459.wav	Yeah, so like an x axis	dev
audio_0_168862.wav	So, it needs to have all the data members, but it can add its own to further refine the whole concept	dev
audio_0_107650.wav	And therefore, this ratio of the ultimate displacement of the structure, delta U to yield displacement of the structure	dev
audio_0_168445.wav	And we will try to understand that what is overriding of member functions, and how does it interact with the concept of overloading that you are already familiar with	dev
audio_0_1072.wav	So they are corresponding points there is a relationship of homography among themselves	dev
audio_0_128075.wav	Computer and logic circuits uses digital integrated circuits	dev
audio_0_141657.wav	so this is this, this say numerical, we consider for the single phase transmission line	dev
audio_0_125953.wav	And to increase the gain of filter replace R2 with 100 kilo ohm	dev
audio_0_124120.wav	So, how we can now understand whether this p type 100 or n type 100 or p type 111 or n type 111, how you will know	dev
audio_0_134337.wav	The next thing we actually look at is this character pointer p, so character pointer p is initialised to format, so therefore p gets…s p is efficiency pointing to this format string	dev
audio_0_141107.wav	then from two twenty k v line will go then two twenty k v by, say, one thirty two k v, then one thirty two by sixty six k v, then sixty six by thirty three k v, and so on	dev
audio_0_129413.wav	My SiO2 which is not protected by my photoresist will get etched, we will etched right easy	dev
audio_0_170929.wav	So, in this case the homology modelling would not work because it will adopt different types of structures	dev
audio_0_171077.wav	In this case we get only one conformation; so, protein also have different conformation not only active sites, but other place also they have different conformations	dev
audio_0_10779.wav	So, p 3 will be your 22 into 6, 132 watt so, power absorbed right	dev
audio_0_120863.wav	But, then we saw based on some of the issues, I can go back to the previous setting and may be it will be good to do a quick recap of that particular slide is, where we looked at that this is the global outsourcing and networking partners	dev
audio_0_122029.wav	But, I would like you as your assignment to identify and tell me at least two such service instances that you see around you	dev
audio_0_103937.wav	So, what the focal adhesions are allowing is this leading cells to kind of trying to go outside while these other cells at the rear end are following the leader cell so, but the other thing is	dev
audio_0_109241.wav	I'm just flagging this off because it's an important aspect as you use these equations to estimate the strength according to the Kulum type failure criterion	dev
audio_0_130943.wav	So, this we see is a very simple example of a vulnerability due to buffer overreads	dev
audio_0_11555.wav	Simultaneously, I can show you the peak value and the rms value peak value of the rms value such that our our understanding will be very much clear right	dev
audio_0_11459.wav	When you write this in form, I mean P plus jQ form, it will be volt ampere right, but this one is watt, and this one is var because, if you take its magnitude, it will be volt ampere that is why we write VA	dev
audio_0_128589.wav	Or we have to use the instrumentation amplifier, and lot of other experiments	test
audio_0_146562.wav	this might be my value, but for others the value might be different	test
audio_0_128308.wav	So, this is the power button, all right	test
audio_0_128959.wav	So, one is on my hand, and it is easy to identify I can refer like it is yellow, right this is orange and gray, right	test
audio_0_132293.wav	Number of set bits which is 6 over here because we have 64 different sets	test
audio_0_110323.wav	So, you can actually think about A is nothing but voltage ratio provided I 2 is equal to 0	test
audio_0_172118.wav	Inclusive	test
audio_0_13879.wav	So that means, when it is i is equal to it is coming minus 8 ampere	test
audio_0_4843.wav	So, in general if we take first condition that XL minus XC is equal to R ultimately mod XL minus mod XC is equal to actually R right	test
audio_0_113287.wav	So, you have reached at this particular point and at this point, what is input impedance	test
audio_0_26065.wav	one is that it overcomes ISI with very low, with very low complexity, and that is the advantage of OFDM or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing that its a very low complexity or very efficient scheme to overcome the inter symbol interference in the wireless channel	test
audio_0_121415.wav	And your strategic plan will say, that ultimately this is the managerial action charter to achieve desired outcome	test
audio_0_14881.wav	So, please solve it for yourself answers are given for this one right	test
audio_0_26701.wav	Each row corresponds to a particular time And each column corresponds to a	test
audio_0_141619.wav	so that means your v a one is equal to v a zero	test
audio_0_153747.wav	Because V upon V+ is nothing but gamma L	test
audio_0_161355.wav	if it has more than one assignable zero, you will not make the assignment	test
audio_0_155833.wav	The center is at the origin however its radius is greater than that of smith chart therefore it is also all points inside the smith chart are unconditionally stable	test
audio_0_19892.wav	Labour cost is 60 as per calculation	test
audio_0_169867.wav	Similarly, in the third case here we show that even the first parameter has been defaulted	test
audio_0_109193.wav	Now this factor is directly dependent on the aspect ratio of the wall, H being the height of the wall and L being the length of the wall	test
audio_0_1155.wav	Now H is also known as conjugate rotation homography and can be used to measure the angle of rotation of two views and the eigenvector corresponding to the real eigenvalue which is mu is shown here as the mu which is a scalar which is also indicating scale value on this set of eigenvalues	test
audio_0_114856.wav	So, this is the modulating signal	test
audio_0_154186.wav	Since voltage and current are not effective concepts we really cannot define impedance in terms of voltage and current always	test
audio_0_26724.wav	that is, how do we come up with the likelihood function and how do we do the exact vector parameter estimation that we are going to explore in the subsequent modules	test
audio_0_112895.wav	So, that is the expression for P l	test
audio_0_110705.wav	83 dB and that is mainly because of the finite gain of the first stage and second stage	test
audio_0_3625.wav	So, I am not going to repeat right, so this is your what you call is some kind of your idea you have	test
audio_0_170004.wav	This 6	test
audio_0_151872.wav	And this is exactly the term sitting there	test
audio_0_10972.wav	If you say V is the rms value, and I is the rms value, because both numerator and denominator you are dividing by root 2	test
audio_0_115025.wav	So, you can see that equivalent capacitance seen by this inductor is series capacitance of this varactor diode then series capacitance of this varactor diode, ground over here is common to this particular thing, then another series capacitance over here, another series capacitance over here	test
audio_0_118963.wav	This ability of consumers to quickly become part of a network; obviously, highly enhances their negotiating power and creates many new service delivery opportunities	test
audio_0_124149.wav	What are these devices	test
audio_0_15077.wav	The starting current is five times the full load current the stator impedance and magnetizing current may be neglected	test
audio_0_29113.wav	reduced latency of data, appropriate action at the time, right time, prevents major accidents such as machine failure and so on	test
audio_0_20666.wav	That is to reduce the number of U 235 isotopes to half of this original value, we need more than 3 years	test
audio_0_130775.wav	So in this way the fragmentation can be reduced the sum of this large free chunk can now be used to service possibly many more malloc requests	test
audio_0_18033.wav	Now for each of these plans you have to calculate the break even points	test
audio_0_163436.wav	But all of these are necessarily in the infix notation	test
audio_0_172056.wav	So, understand the difference between each classifier and use the WEKA wisely, you can save your model by clicking on the save model, which can be used later for new predictions	test
audio_0_108230.wav	This is the assumption that you will have to make because you don't know where the neutral axis is actually lying	test
audio_0_122543.wav	We have to see, what kind of customers are coming up with what kind of demand at what point of time and so on and so forth	test
audio_0_15926.wav	So, the here we are writing for the your in v is equal to right in delta w by delta eq	test
audio_0_106907.wav	So, in this case you have pressure and water is entering the remaining pores under pressure	test
audio_0_172529.wav	So, go to ligand again torsion tree choose torsions	test
audio_0_118071.wav	Positive y means it is capacitive and negative y would mean inductive ok	test
audio_0_156664.wav	So this is sometimes this is can be written as PAVN, sorry this is PL upon PAVS	test
audio_0_158520.wav	so once again, when we came to the other one, there is only one row that is available and other there are two columns that are available	test
audio_0_118998.wav	And then, it will go backward and it will fetch, it will trigger a forward moving action of component sub assemblies all coming together and finally, getting delivered installed operated at your place	test
audio_0_16675.wav	Take minus sin out	test
audio_0_113988.wav	2, then what happens you are taking care of component tolerances	test
audio_0_164620.wav	But, what is significant is, if you again move your attention back to where this compare function is defined in the C++ part	test
audio_0_125467.wav	Now guys you see slowly and gradually I am trying to show you several applications	test
audio_0_16508.wav	So, impedance will be Z right, impedance will be Z right	test
audio_0_13162.wav	So, if you look into that; that your delta t is your differentiation of d u t by d t right	test
audio_0_100813.wav	So, these can migrate in amoeboidal motility cells might migrate hundred times faster than mesenchymal cells	test
audio_0_173327.wav	There are 3 different ways you can have the rooted trees if you think about the ancestor	test
audio_0_133954.wav	The huge problem with actually running JavaScript in your web browser is that JavaScript is extremely slow and therefore it is not suited for high end graphic web pages or for example if you are running games over the web, so using JavaScript would be essentially a huge disadvantage because the rendering would be extremely slow, so keeping this in mind one would want to run C and C++ code in your web browser	test
audio_0_136077.wav	so if you, i mean, particularly when we will come, load flow, then economical, economical load dispatch and falls studies, right	test
audio_0_147877.wav	you have a group discussion where everybody is quiet, everybody is cerebral, talking in a focused way	test
audio_0_140972.wav	so instead of writing this we are writing high voltage, side phase voltage	test
audio_0_102308.wav	What does this drug BDM do	test
audio_0_21381.wav	Now, if we start with the lightest possible element that is hydrogen having a mass number of 1	test
audio_0_101448.wav	So, this is called, so this is your imposing a strain with how much your pushing the sample and your controlling the amplitude of rotation the frequency of rotation	test
audio_0_148723.wav	covert communication can also mean communicating secretly with somebody	test
audio_0_106435.wav	So these are basically what we refer to as cut lintel's	test
audio_0_18735.wav	Because if your labour, material costs are your major costs costs as per the level of change of sales units those costs are likely to change so there the fixed budget doesn't become very much suitable now the solution to this problem is flexible budget now flexible budget show the expected result of responsibility center for several levels of activities	test
audio_0_162856.wav	If Poornima has to integrate, she has to understand the whole code and then edit that make changes within that and that will become a complete nightmare	test
audio_0_164968.wav	So, it will try to think that this whole thing is the B object which actually it is not exist only the A object exist	test
audio_0_101721.wav	So, the advantage of this technique is first of all you can tune the stiffness of the pillars, by changing the pillar length	test
audio_0_137914.wav	that is more important	test
audio_0_134756.wav	So, in this multiplexer it is highly unlikely that there is a hardware Trojan present in them due to the fact that none of these signals are actually stealthy	test
audio_0_16729.wav	Therefore, right	test
audio_0_13479.wav	So, I mean ah this is your what you call; that means, v is equal to every time arrow and arrow is there, I am not telling it it is a understandable is equal to v x plus j V y also, right	test
audio_0_116467.wav	However, if you look at this particular thing the direction of this is in the right hand direction, you can see it is going in this direction, if you look at the direction of this one here, it is also going in this particular direction	test
audio_0_124611.wav	For SOP also everything is given	test
audio_0_119905.wav	So, to summarize, when customers are dissatisfied, they can take different actions, but very few people take actions, but if they do take actions, see that they are encouraged and your process is easy, but they can complain to you rather than go to a public forum and complain	test
audio_0_25621.wav	this we have derived as basically equal to 14	test
audio_0_24677.wav	And all his revenue actually came from the servicing of two wheelers	test
audio_0_149580.wav	The last problem here we want to solve this one 4x1, 2x2 x3 and then we have the second equation we have the third linear equation	test
audio_0_112492.wav	And the next part is the resistance, the next is the value of that particular resistance	test
audio_0_161030.wav	so now let us try and subtract some constant and try to subtract as much as we can	test
audio_0_119779.wav	So, perception after service and expectation before service or in service this P minus E is the measure of quality is the foundation of customer satisfaction models	test
audio_0_133282.wav	The system function would then pick from the stack, the only argument that it requires and this argument is a character pointer and it is expecting a pointer to a string comprising of an executable, so it uses this address as the argument and picks the string /bin/sh and executes it	test
audio_0_132389.wav	One program could have one or more arenas which are present, now each arena is of 132 kilobytes and these arenas are created by invocations to the operating system	test
audio_0_123751.wav	And it can also be determined by understanding the slew rate by understanding the slew rate ; that means, if I apply this signal at the input can I also see the corresponding change in the output simultaneously right it has some lack	test
audio_0_163760.wav	So, what it does is something interesting, once I it have written that then I can use the max function like this I can, I will write max within corner bracket I will put a type and then I will show the original name of the function is max that is templatized name and this is the instantiated name, which means that if I when I put this int it means that used the code of max, but take t to be int	test
audio_0_11439.wav	So, 3 into pi r dash square l, this is the volume	test
audio_0_134993.wav	next will go for the fault studies, right	test
audio_0_161663.wav	now, when we open this spreadsheet, there are several ah and we can go to click on data that is available here and you you find the solver that is written here	test
audio_0_166572.wav	Of course, we do not have a format here; it is a constant string being printed	test
audio_0_165185.wav	So, first let us focus on the two sides	test
audio_0_127453.wav	So, let us now design a basic wide band RC band stop filter with a lower cutoff frequency of 400 hertz right	test
audio_0_146858.wav	why is it that this happens	test
audio_0_154112.wav	Eta is given by square root of mu over E, is called intrinsic impedance	test
audio_0_141631.wav	one is that a phase a there is a line to ground fault and at the same time phase b and c	test
audio_0_111005.wav	This will be more clear from the plot of the stability circles	test
audio_0_167459.wav	We have been discussing about type casting in C and V plus plus, and particularly the cast operators in C++	test
audio_0_132057.wav	So, for example you could add a new node to this list	test
audio_0_17706.wav	Please read the case carefully	test
audio_0_170106.wav	This is output you can check later on Next design works with a polymorphic hierarchy	test
audio_0_141097.wav	is that by properly specifying base quantities, the equivalent circuit of transformer can be simplified	test
audio_0_3929.wav	So, for dependent current source we apply KCL at node B, in this case, what will happen that this current your what you call this is a dependent this is a dependent current; this is actually I and this is actually 3 I, this is a dependent current source, right	test
audio_0_138826.wav	i have written there this notation, very important, that k is new bus	test
audio_0_142058.wav	similarly, for phase b, also same thing will come: r dash, d one to the power half	test
audio_0_139896.wav	so what will be the optimal generation scheduling	test
audio_0_131947.wav	As we see in this very common figure is that if an attacker cannot go through the right way then what he could possibly use is a side channel and use some indirect information to actually break the specific cipher	test
audio_0_114089.wav	So, as I had just mentioned, if this is inductance this should be capacitance, the reactance of this capacitance should be negative of the reactance of this particular inductor	test
audio_0_149090.wav	so this is nothing but just a kind of negotiation, only ah convincing each other, getting the work done, ah by certain ah process, by certain communication, ah practices	test
audio_0_151262.wav	And then we integrate here, we have x cube by 3 and then minus pi to pi	test
audio_0_132384.wav	On the other hand every malloc that is invoked from the main thread would use this segment for its allocation, so this allocation is where you have the main arena and this newly created segment is where we would have arena for the thread of the thread arena, so in this way what we see is that it is likely that every thread that we create in a particular program gets a separate segment	test
audio_0_105176.wav	So, your edge moved ahead and again the edge your correlation dropped there was a corresponding flow and this flow was backward because the turnover is positive the flow is backwards we have a negative correlation	test
audio_0_165233.wav	So, b now becomes an alias of what was x	test
audio_0_122003.wav	In full scale, do some post launch view and then, again come to the development stage	test
audio_0_122677.wav	surgery	test
audio_0_154672.wav	So, to do that we have our S212 as 1 upon omega 6	test
audio_0_152303.wav	So, we from the previous slide we have these two first order derivatives ux and uy	test
audio_0_24750.wav	So in the next segment we will actually be looking at conflicts arising because of solutions that you have introduced	test
audio_0_132973.wav	It starts off with an identifier	test
audio_0_120628.wav	The customer no longer had to bother that whether it was done with in brand new machine or with a second hand machine	test
audio_0_108264.wav	So we were looking at the conditions under which out of plane bending becomes essential and critical as a resisting mechanism of masonry and we are examining unreinforced masonry still	test
audio_0_164128.wav	In this module, we will talk about friend Function and friend Class trying to understand what do they mean and why are they useful in C++ design process	test
audio_0_15591.wav	So, that is why it is writing v 3 minus v 2 by 6 is equal to v v by 4 plus v 2 by 6 right	test
audio_0_164645.wav	The key has to be passed as its address, so you pass ampersand key	test
audio_0_162738.wav	But you think about any of the other variables that any of the other members that is C has none of them are accessible to for example, v is not accessible, because v here is protected; z is not accessible, why z not accessible, because if I talk about C dot z, then there is no z here	test
audio_0_19307.wav	So, we will charge depreciation on that asset for five years period and that depreciation is included on day to day cost	test
audio_0_166818.wav	Now, there is something	test
audio_0_156828.wav	Just I want to make this small correction	test
audio_0_153784.wav	So this corresponds to all active devices and this corresponds to all passive devices	test
audio_0_21349.wav	If you refer to the value that I presented in the previous lecture, the mass of electron is at least 10 to the power four times lower than that of protons and neutrons and therefore, while calculating this mass defect and associated quantities, the mass of electron is quite often neglected	test
audio_0_161992.wav	so we looked at examples for unboundedness and infeasibility and we showed the graphical solution to this problem and we said that this is ah, unbounded	test
audio_0_23283.wav	For example for our case it is serving the purpose of a notebook, it is giving you the exact similar experience of how you write and you are getting that you can store that thing in a digitised format whichever you right you know it is in your own handwriting, you do not have to like differ from this product to any other digital medium, even the best mediums that we see around till today they are still digital, they do not give you the real time experience after writing	test
audio_0_11912.wav	So, if you have sinusoidal waveform, so it will complete 50 such cycles 50 such cycles in 1 second right	test
audio_0_125991.wav	5 kilo hertz, and you will see that keep keeping increasing the frequency will also allow the output signal to follow the input signal, and thus, this active high pass filter is working well	test
audio_0_133728.wav	Now if we just offset our analysis by 1 byte and state that instead of starting from F7 we start with C7 then we get a different sequence of instructions	test
audio_0_19848.wav	For the quarter the ending inventory is the March inventory that is 9,000	test
audio_0_168425.wav	Statements like case as we have shown in switch are also called labeled statement because there is a label to them	test
audio_0_149889.wav	If we compute, now this was a simple pole, so we have to get basically this limit, this is what we have discussed earlier z minus 1 f z and z approaches to 1 we have to evaluate and this we have evaluated before also, so it was e minus 1 i by 2, this calculation says	test
audio_0_105012.wav	So, you have a huge variation in Z direction which is difficult to do when you are just scanning the surface like this	test
audio_0_171057.wav	For example, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, acceptors and the molar refractivity	test
audio_0_10898.wav	This two are valid connection because any across any terminal, you can only connect the equal voltage source	test
audio_0_104032.wav	So, what this would what they observed was that in MDA MB and HT cells, So, these cells ECM stiffness led to increased MMP 2 and 9 activities	test
audio_0_164992.wav	Now, let say we have done an up cast	test
audio_0_122760.wav	The act 2 can be where you are in the process of dining and act 3 can be a departure after your bill and everything is done	test
audio_0_1836.wav	So it says that you consider the following color filter array whose first row corresponds to the red row and first column of that row corresponds to a green pixel of the bar pattern which means the left most and topmost position of the array location in this particular display that element corresponds to red row and green column in our convention of denoting any location	test
audio_0_116704.wav	So in India, we allow these particular antennas to transmit 20 Watt of power for 2G and 3G and we allow them to transmit 40 Watt of power for 4G	test
audio_0_119971.wav	We have discussed one aspect of it that by create service roles and we creates scripts for each role player, but if you want to go into deeper, it is very important to understand the touch points and their nature and the how their link together on the flow	test
audio_0_127887.wav	tTill then you take care	test
audio_0_162723.wav	So, let us it is parent is D, D does not have any y; u, v and w, it is does not have any y	test
audio_0_163447.wav	If I have an expression, in which say I have an expression like a + b * c	test
audio_0_118460.wav	So, IF generated because of the RF signal is at a phase of 90 degree	test
audio_0_133187.wav	Now in an ARM processor which is enabled with the Trustzone the TLB is modified a bit now each entry of the TLB not only comprises of the virtual address and the corresponding physical address but also has details about the NSTID bit corresponding to the virtual address and the NS bit corresponding to the physical address so in other words it will identify whether the virtual address was need with respect to a normal world operation or the secure world operation	test
audio_0_121486.wav	So, to complete this diagram therefore, this is the overall service delivery process which starts with customer and ends with the customer	test
audio_0_17510.wav	What about variable over rates	test
audio_0_134076.wav	So this particular module corresponds to the code that we have seen in the presentation	test
audio_0_2471.wav	We were talking about process FMEA and in context of that we were taking about the problem of wax lining and door interiors between the inner and the outer member where there were potential causes of failures associated with rusting of the painting body or painted body or even rusting of the components like window regulator etcetera, which are put inner and you know inside the inner member of the door	test
audio_0_163107.wav	But, certainly I could not have meant that because my names are different	test
audio_0_120787.wav	So, therefore, the customer 1 or customer 2 or customer 3 themselves may also have, it actually represents a network	test
audio_0_10214.wav	So, the closest value of x C is 2 ohm right, because we will got actually what you call, it is 0	test
audio_0_110209.wav	So, you can work with the assumption that you have cracked surfaces at the top and the bottom allowing for some rotation and therefore the assumption of a pinned end of the two ends being pin is rather acceptable from the engineering calculations themselves	test
audio_0_119139.wav	So, we call this rate fencing and creating buckets of demand	test
audio_0_29083.wav	they also produce large number of large volumes of data	test
audio_0_16627.wav	So, I this i L is equal to your V, your V m	test
audio_0_172599.wav	So, go to analyze clustering show the clusters	test
audio_0_25692.wav	from the knowledge of X1, X2… XN and the observed outputs Y1, Y2… YN, one can now estimate the unknown channel coefficient H, as we are going to describe shortly	test
audio_0_11330.wav	So, V an is this point, this is my phase voltage	test
audio_0_163476.wav	So, to come to how you do it, how you take a look at the operator function, say MyType is, some type which I am just assuming that it could be an enum type or a struct type as I said it cannot be a built in type	test
audio_0_1589.wav	I will provide you the principles without going into much details	test
audio_0_143907.wav	so i say that if i meet someone, she should be nice to me	test
audio_0_128714.wav	Now, if I see that then what I would find that is current here is nothing but V by R1 here will be V by R 1, that equals to zero volts	test
audio_0_117730.wav	So, many times they install these jammers	test
audio_0_141807.wav	resistance per kilo meter is given, point one, six ohm, and inductance per kilo meter is given one point two mili henry	test
audio_0_114499.wav	So, you see corresponding to 1	test
audio_0_173436.wav	C; what it b1	test
audio_0_107323.wav	The picture on the right on the other hand tells you that separation between orthogonal walls simply because you don't have a tensile resisting material there can happen rather easily when you have significant seismic forces, in fact even moderate seismic forces	test
audio_0_141286.wav	so for which you can compute this part right and divided by you are the new base impedance, right now	test
audio_0_166062.wav	If I want to have a reference, that reference will have to be a constant, which will refer to the value of j plus k as computed as the value of the reference	test
audio_0_125987.wav	So, 4	test
audio_0_172289.wav	This is essentially you can see the biological activity there is a function of the molecular or the fragmental properties	test
audio_0_167141.wav	In this module we have shown how we can work with arrays, how vector really makes it easier to make arrays variable sized and how strings operations can be done very easily in C++ using the string type from the standard library	test
audio_0_21812.wav	So that is why notes and teacher’s PPTs are very important this time	test
audio_0_148509.wav	if you are stressed or you are continuously working, then your fatigue will be there, mental stress will be there	test
audio_0_19402.wav	Now, how will you go about it	test
audio_0_120253.wav	Because, either they did not have credit cards or they were not very comfortable to use credit cards, debit cards on the net	test
audio_0_110801.wav	Why we focus more on g s value	test

audio_0_24270.wav	So, this is a great model to understand a conflict	test
audio_0_158385.wav	rather than taking one constraint at a time, can i take multiple constraints at a time, multiply each of these constraints by a positive or a non negative number, so that the sign of the inequality does not change, and then add, and after doing this multiplication and addition, if i get us, i will get a single constraint	test
audio_0_20451.wav	So, it releases one, it goes through a gamma decay process that is releases the gamma photon, and then come back to the ground state	test
audio_0_128664.wav	So, when we see a specification sheet of an operational amplifier, you may not be able to see the input capacitance	test
audio_0_113280.wav	Now, this is y ok, this was Z, we have move opposite this is y	test
audio_0_127203.wav	So, we are continuing our same lecture and we have divided like I said into few modules; 2 or 3 first module, we have seen the characteristics of op amp in terms of power supply, in terms of the terminals, in terms of the ideal op amp which has infinite input impedance, infinite gain, 0 output impedance, infinite band width right	test
audio_0_109864.wav	That is the mechanism that we are examining	test
audio_0_137150.wav	but one thing i can tell you that z bus coding actually is not difficult, it is quite easy	test
audio_0_28779.wav	Therefore, the numerator of this expression, that is, if I look at the numerator of this expression, that is X bar transpose Y bar	test
audio_0_118939.wav	They started transforming original services and creating many new types of services, for example in Hong Kong, they introduced octopus, which was initially a contact less prepaid card for paying the fare on Hong Kong metro	test
audio_0_150479.wav	And when we compute the determinant of this function here what we will realize that the value of the determinant is nothing but x naught minus x1, x1 minus x2 and x2 minus x0	test
audio_0_114199.wav	Now, again positive half cycle comes and electron will move towards anode, and then again negative half cycle, so like this this process goes on	test
audio_0_113026.wav	So, basically in that hole the copper is actually speaking put around that	test
audio_0_116737.wav	And in fact, this guideline of 4500 milliWatt per meter square for GSM 900 is only valid for 6 minutes per day	test
audio_0_16439.wav	If you write angle in the numerator and your what you call in the numerator right	test
audio_0_103488.wav	So now imagine if I were to consider an elastic entity as a as a liquid	test
audio_0_132671.wav	So the attack as such is quite simple the attacker we assume is running in the user space and has these two lines written in the program, the first line i equal to *pointer corresponds to something like this we have a pointer variable over here and let us assume that this point of variable is pointing to a location say this	test
audio_0_122421.wav	So, which means at the most we can process 60 people in this block, in the next flow where there may be you know the patients dress will be changed and certain hygienic steps will be done	test
audio_0_125678.wav	So, I will have 0, minus 5; for minus 5 my current is let us say 1	test
audio_0_16219.wav	So, if you solve this circuit you will get your i 3 is equal to i 4 you will i 3 will get 2 ampere and i 4 is equal to 1	test
audio_0_15706.wav	For example come here	test
audio_0_111855.wav	So, we can actually just take an approximation as that this is to be matched with free space	test
audio_0_116274.wav	The answer is that the tangential component of the electric field should be 0 at the conducting boundary in the parallel plane waveguide the conducting plates are at x is equal to 0 and x is equal to a and the tangential field is E z	test

audio_0_117602.wav	We know that the base emitter voltage varies by 2	test
audio_0_104685.wav	And these integrins play important roles in migration, homeostasis so on and so forth	test
audio_0_172994.wav	So, here the performance is a prediction accuracy and experience is optimizing the hydrophobicity, when they learn the data	test
audio_0_125969.wav	So now, the input signal that we have decided is, we had to apply 5V and 50 hertz and he has to also connect the output of the operational amplifier to the oscilloscope, because we are looking at the change in the output on the oscilloscope	test
audio_0_156706.wav	As you know passive if an element is passive that is if there is some real resistance to it if the real part of its impedance is positive, then such a device will always be stable because such a device is a passive device	test
audio_0_166114.wav	It will, which will take two variables a, and b and try to swap them	test
audio_0_152952.wav	Because this was a derivative and we integrate so this derivative will be removed we have the limit s to infinity and then the right hand side this F s will be integrated from s to infinity	test
audio_0_117478.wav	Now, if I talk about in terms of efficiency then the efficiency of class A amplifier is minimum that is about 20 percent and 25 percent, and it is maximum for class C amplifier it is around 95 percent	test
audio_0_122469.wav	So, let me now go to the topic of day, the consumer in the services flow traveling from the pre purchase to the service encounter to the post purchase stage	test
audio_0_14620.wav	So, and basically if you think about electrical engineering we are often interested that actually electrical transfer in energy from one point to another	test
audio_0_128649.wav	Pin 7 is plus VCC	test
audio_0_101548.wav	So, what I what he has been showed	test
audio_0_22199.wav	So we essentially designed five pages, the first page would be a login page where the user, student or teachers logs in	test
audio_0_120409.wav	But, generally we are moving experiences, performances and solutions which are not physically shipped and stored	test
audio_0_171203.wav	You can use the octonol you can ethanol right you can use the concentration to get the partition right	test
audio_0_134480.wav	Now using the setuid tool this thing can be prevented, the third utility which is exploited by OKWS is that in unique systems one process would actually create the file descriptors and could pass that file descriptors to other processes and once the second process obtains the file descriptors it would be able to access privileged files or any other files as required without any other checks	test
audio_0_163578.wav	So, using that we can define initialize an object and we can print the object	test
audio_0_128860.wav	I have shown you this integrated circuit, isn't it	test
audio_0_141376.wav	so basically, a square, z p b is actually z s right	test
audio_0_132967.wav	So, in the section header table, essentially there is a structure which would help you locate the various sections present in the Elf object file	test
audio_0_119214.wav	On the other hand, in case of the economy demand a huge variation can be created by providing incentives and this is a topic which we will discuss in greater detail when we discuss a pricing that how these capacity management and price management can work together	test
audio_0_123573.wav	Earlier the signal was passing through the resistor, and the capacitor was placed here in the low pass filter	test
audio_0_159132.wav	i am high lighting a every term that we are doing in this table	test
audio_0_106796.wav	However the failure initiates by the formation of tensile cracks which are actually parallel to the direction of loading	test
audio_0_142747.wav	and this line one to two voltage: here one, two, three, four voltage are marks at v one v two, v three, v four	test
audio_0_115898.wav	So, the capacitance should be decreased by a factor of R 0	test
audio_0_11917.wav	So, you can write number of cycles per revolution into number of revolution per second	test
audio_0_15564.wav	For example, i 6 will be your v 3 for example, here i 6 will be ah sorry ah sorry	test
audio_0_167935.wav	Now, the code to swop two variables could swop int variables, could swop double variables, could swop cad variables and so on	test
audio_0_161161.wav	now the dual will have all variables greater than or equal to zero and all constraints of the greater than or equal to type	test
audio_0_147698.wav	self disclosure, that is, formation of bonds, reduced needs for further testing, because once we have tested the self disclosure then no more testing is required	test
audio_0_104479.wav	What you see is in both of these cases the amount; there is a stiffness dependent modulation of this MMP activity	test
audio_0_10568.wav	Note that as t tends to infinity omega r infinity is equal to half C V 0 square that is omega C 0 right	test
audio_0_13303.wav	So, again this value will become negative	test
audio_0_10208.wav	Then the equivalent circuit is this V 45	test
audio_0_26173.wav	This is your variance of estimate at time and basically this is also the mean square error at time N	test
audio_0_103120.wav	So, you cannot record, you would not get any spectra for of peak, which is below 25 Pico Newtons	test
audio_0_105075.wav	It has a finite spread, sitting on a PA gel let us assume	test
audio_0_120235.wav	Their values and attitudes, their manners and customs their sense of esthetics, color, feel, texture, education social competency that is the central block	test
audio_0_20058.wav	Now variable overhead variances are pretty similar to the material or labour variances which we have studied	test
audio_0_158316.wav	Now let us go over to three phase controlled, rather fully controlled bridge rectify	test
audio_0_151036.wav	So, for instance, we have a function here of 2 variable 3 x square y plus 2 x y cube, and if you find the gradient, then we have a vector function here, which is given by this expression and then so this is the function which takes a point in R2 plane and gives a vector in R2	test
audio_0_14388.wav	So, that is why your this i t is equal to minus i L into 1 upon 1 plus 4 that is minus 1 upon 5 i L t	test
audio_0_28749.wav	okay, Now in the next module we have to talk about what are the estimates of the capital Xs, that is, the, or, the um, the um, the, the FFT coefficients in the frequency domain and finally perform the IFFT to get the estimates of the symbols in the time domain	test
audio_0_101124.wav	So, there must be some connections which exist which connect this	test
audio_0_105430.wav	Your question is whether this confinement is coming from the unit above and below in a stack or from the neighboring units in a wall construction	test
audio_0_104383.wav	So, you can have pulling forces that is contractile forces, you can have pushing forces pushing forces and you can have remodeling	test
audio_0_103518.wav	So, you actually position the sample between the top moving part and the bottom stationary part	test
audio_0_163089.wav	So, let us take an example	test
audio_0_153352.wav	In this case means the case when we have the piecewise continuous function, so in this case we can only conclude that f t will be equal to g t outside the point of discontinuities	test
audio_0_166917.wav	This is the Module Outline and it will be available on the left of every slide that you see	test
audio_0_170374.wav	So, here the overall amino acid frequencies which is different from different families; so in order to if you want to implement if you want to include this information then we need to give weightage for the different a protein families then you can see which one is highly conserved compared with the other ones then there is another measure this is called a sum of pairs method right here	test
audio_0_128553.wav	First position is for the channel one, second position is for channel 2	test
audio_0_22006.wav	And I am pursuing my MBA from SIBM, Pune	test
audio_0_123334.wav	So, let us see this particular slide first, by the time he repairs the circuit and then we go on the circuit	test
audio_0_2021.wav	So feature locations may not be precisely found	test
audio_0_147797.wav	but one thing is very, very important all through that, being a student of communication, i will re emphasize that communication is playing again, very, very important role	test
audio_0_111628.wav	Similarly, for other mode, we can calculate in this the lowest cutoff frequency is of TE 1 0 mode	test
audio_0_168389.wav	So, here I have shown the different examples	test
audio_0_110772.wav	Now, let us plot noise figure circle on the smith chart	test
audio_0_103743.wav	So, below of critical concentration you will not have any filaments	test
audio_0_162797.wav	And then, in the main I show how to use that	test
audio_0_119703.wav	You have seen in the last lecture, how we can create some flexibility in the capacity, but that has limitation	test
audio_0_105746.wav	And we directly apply this R factor to reduce design forces	test
audio_0_110119.wav	We are interested in rewriting this in terms of the stress in the joint and therefore it's just rewritten in terms of sigma j x with the knowledge of the uniaxial compressive strength of the motor joint material itself	test
audio_0_106194.wav	If you remember, we used a homogenized cross section and we said that the stress strain curve of the cross section can be linear elastic in compression till failure or non linear at failure at ultimate	test
audio_0_158660.wav	we still write ten x one plus nine, x two	test
audio_0_168828.wav	So, together it is a multilevel inheritance red rose is a rose, is a flower	test
audio_0_167436.wav	Certainly the other aspects that you should have learnt well, and is designing good data types is a key for good programming in C++, because C++ is strongly type and everything that you want to do, you want to make a type for that	test
audio_0_20820.wav	Here you can see that is in fact, a reduction in the per capita energy consumption	test
audio_0_112439.wav	So, now, if you want to plot the gain, so to plot the gain of this particular antenna, you can go to this particular option post processing then use result template then select far field and antenna properties	test
audio_0_109442.wav	Model is of elasticity is required primarily to make the estimation of N, the modular ratio	test
audio_0_21617.wav	Like we can go on PDF also	test
audio_0_169171.wav	So here I take the pointer to that object and based on the dynamic type I dispatch to any one of this functions depending on its corresponding type	test
audio_0_133470.wav	So, besides all of this we have two CPU registers which are used to manage this stack pointer, one is the frame pointer which is typically the register BP in Intel x86 and the other one is the stack pointer or SP in the x86 nomenclature	test
audio_0_118181.wav	In general, the wave is propagated in any waveguide because of the total internal reflection and let us say, if wave is launched inside, this waveguide at an angle theta, then by that second law of reflection which states that the angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence	test
audio_0_132938.wav	So, the value of glob according to this program should have been 5555 but, since we have modified the GOT table, therefore, glob actually has a value of 100	test
audio_0_117122.wav	So, these two will cancel each other and this impedance is same as this these two will cancel over here and the net resultant is that S 41 will be equal to 0	test
audio_0_17199.wav	Then this red line is known as total sales, sometimes called as TR or the total revenue line	test
audio_0_167228.wav	So, the size of packet will be 8 bytes which is the size of the largest component double	test
audio_0_135250.wav	i minus p is the acceleration power, accelerating power	test
audio_0_163188.wav	If we look into the second, which is s, is int, which matches the second parameter type of both these functions	test
audio_0_136616.wav	but here we have the or taken that initial values: one plus j zero and one plus j zero	test
audio_0_171515.wav	Even some polar residues which are highly hydrophobic, if they are surrounded with the hydrophobic environment hydrophobic residues	test
audio_0_21205.wav	So, where E R is the amount of energy released; because of fission sigma f is the macroscopic cross section, phi is the flux distribution by the neutron	test
audio_0_138765.wav	we will compute the y bus that suppose y one one, it will be y one three, it will be y one two, it will be y one four plus that your	test
audio_0_100958.wav	So, I also like to emphasize that cells are you know the spread shape of a cell is actively determined by the surroundings in which the cell lies	test
audio_0_171956.wav	So, we discuss more about 3D structures and the coordinates, now the question is we have a lot of data; like the PDB contains 133,000 structures right	test
audio_0_143353.wav	so when x is equal to zero, so this is the receiving end current	test
audio_0_102946.wav	A Fat cell, this is the shape of a Fat cell, a Muscle cell, and nerve cell, versus a bone cell is you have the nuclei at the center	test
audio_0_104968.wav	I give you 2 papers; one is Griffin et al	test
audio_0_127783.wav	Next if a “stop band” is very narrow or highly attenuated over a small range of frequencies, your stop band is extremely narrow or highly attenuated over a small range of frequencies, while passing all other frequencies, it is more commonly referred as “Band Notch Filter”	test
audio_0_26803.wav	this does not change	test
audio_0_109648.wav	So, you really have very poor out of plain response of long walls	test
audio_0_163388.wav	It differs only by return type and that is not what is allowed and that is why this is considered to be a redefinition as if you are redefining the same function as if you would have given this if you would have compiled this example with C	test
audio_0_21182.wav	So, with all these kinds of fuels in any reactor while choosing the fuel we can consider several factors like the fuel must have a very high fission cross section	test
audio_0_172313.wav	In this case we need to keep these properties for fitting the model, there is called the subjective feature selection	test
audio_0_118346.wav	So, in this case, we have a dual gate MOSFET, and the LO signal is given to one of the gate, and the RF signal is given to the other gate terminal	test
audio_0_18156.wav	So, that we can cover variable cost, any incremental fixed cost, not total fixed cost, just the incremental fixed cost and a small profit may be	test
audio_0_147971.wav	you don't know if you are who you are sharing with	test
audio_0_163087.wav	So, we will come back to it even at a much later stage	test
audio_0_136083.wav	so previously all i have explained, so this, all this things now you can make very easily, right	test
audio_0_134668.wav	So as we seen in the previous lectures design and fabrication of IC involves multiple parties, so multiple third parties are involved like what we have seen is that there may be different third parties from where the company actually buys IP cores, different tools are involved different standard cell libraries and so on and eventually there also could be the fabrication which is done offshore	test
audio_0_151452.wav	So, after simplification we are getting this bn as 2 n pi 1 minus e minus 1 power n and 1 plus n square pi square	test
audio_0_104183.wav	And this is the increased cell spreading is driven by greater focal addition signaling	test

audio_0_165139.wav	So, quiet expectedly what you get after the copy, when you print it after the copy you get a garbage, I got a garbage, while I was running it, but it is quite possible that instead of a garbage, it could be a crash because it just depends on what memory is getting violated	test
audio_0_20717.wav	Once this phi thermal is extremely small compared to the phi xenon, then rho is found to be a linear function of this phi thermal for low flux situations	test
audio_0_165466.wav	Let us continue on this and try to see what happens next	test
audio_0_156849.wav	Then I found out that here the B in is equal to J 1	test
audio_0_121601.wav	So, expectations for a service, those are form by word of mouth from other people, from other customers, from the referrals, from personal needs and evaluation of those needs and matching with the service provider qualification and capabilities, etc	test
audio_0_159324.wav	for the second variable, ten into zero plus nine into one, is nine, nine minus nine zero	test

audio_0_128176.wav	R= (ρL/A) What is this	test
audio_0_166585.wav	What is interesting is, in this format in C++ you can actually put multiple operators multiple operands multiple variables one after the other as we are showing here	test
audio_0_107772.wav	Now, we know that if we were to look at one of these peers at a time knowing the geometry of the peers and with assumptions on the boundary conditions, yes, if it is a blank wall you might want to assume that it has a cantilevered deformation profile	test
audio_0_162625.wav	Similarly, study will work for S, but certainly what will not work is study P, because study is something which is associated with the students	test
audio_0_142828.wav	i mean they all are identical because they have equal magnitude	test
audio_0_126289.wav	Now, let us see another noise called shot noise, shot noise	test
audio_0_158351.wav	now, based on multiplying the first constraint by four, we have said that the upper estimate is eighty four	test
audio_0_29094.wav	so ambulances, ah, then ah, different ah, buildings and ah, different other ah, ah, you know, different other ah ah devices and so on, cars, ah, and so on	test
audio_0_166549.wav	So, to summarize in two lectures in this module, we have introduced the concepts of multiple inheritance, we have explained the basic semantics	test
audio_0_110451.wav	So, subtraction from here to here will lead to a value which is equal to 1 so that means, this is a reciprocal network and that really means that so far we have done the current calculations	test
audio_0_14146.wav	In the case of Norton, i N, R N, and this is basically R L say	test
audio_0_115097.wav	So, plus 1 plus 1 divided by 2 and then plus 1 minus 1 divided by 2 , so that will be 0 this will become 1	test
audio_0_144482.wav	but once we identify and identify the problem, then we can propose the solution and from time to time we can also assess the solution	test
audio_0_161362.wav	those numbers will all be positive number	test
audio_0_164846.wav	There are 5 such and so what I do is I have to go over	test
audio_0_157636.wav	Now if I try to look at the voltage at this point, I told you already that it is either VAN minus LS into D I 1 by D T or V C N plus L S into D 5 by D T	test
audio_0_156275.wav	So here R in is the real part of my Z in and R L is the resonator part	test
audio_0_124083.wav	Once, the edge rounding is done, I will perform the lapping, once the lapping is done I will perform the etching, once the etching is done I will perform the polishing, once the polishing is done I have to inspect the wafer	test
audio_0_103907.wav	So, what the authors did was the first asked that if they made these patterns of various widths, they varied the width of the pattern keeping the same length and they asked that how was the outward movement of cells from this patterns how would how did the vary depending on the width of these patterns	test
audio_0_164295.wav	So, had we made this public then this would have work, but this would also have become accessible, but making this protected we had made sure that this will work, but this will continue to be a compilation error this access will not be allowable for here	test
audio_0_159358.wav	earlier we said the algorithm stopped or terminated when there is no entering variable, when there was no variable, with the positive c j minus z j	test
audio_0_21139.wav	Rather they are more restricted to much small scale use like the medical isotope separation from inline fuel or also using that radiolytic decomposition the production of hydrogen	test
audio_0_137622.wav	and delta q is equal to j four delta v this is equation fifty six, right	test
audio_0_1345.wav	This is a value, get the value with respect to derivative of g at both are 0	test
audio_0_102666.wav	So, if I were to draw approximately the structure of fibronectin	test
audio_0_163118.wav	I cannot similarly call this because it requires two parameters	test
audio_0_137881.wav	if you take this way, i a one, then it will be i a one, z f	test
audio_0_28603.wav	So we have derived this elegant expression for variance of the estimate	test
audio_0_21913.wav	So again I write the keywords of those examples to see, suppose I get an example of case study about TATA, so there is one paragraph which is important for me for tomorrow in my exam next day	test
audio_0_153067.wav	So, this g t is continuous of exponential order and g prime t is piecewise continuous	test
audio_0_135733.wav	and from equation fifty two, t c is equal to same equation	test
audio_0_136840.wav	so that means that means the line will become this, this line will transmit power, this line will be transmit power, so line will become healthy	test
audio_0_150342.wav	So this triangle has this point 1 0 and then 0 1 there	test
audio_0_123877.wav	If you know V in the datasheet there was a power supply rejection ratio the power supply voltage rejection ratio is nothing, but it will tell how about how well the Op amp filters out the noise coming to the power pins right, there is a noise generated in the power pins also	test
audio_0_106625.wav	So, you have an interesting structural functional solution in the form of modern brick concrete floors	test
audio_0_150123.wav	So, when s is positive the limits will remain as it is 0 to infinity	test
audio_0_14739.wav	So, that is why is taken has direction of the positive charge movement	test
audio_0_160924.wav	the algorithm terminates giving the solution: x one equals to three, x two equal to four, with objective function equal to sixty six	test
audio_0_159923.wav	this was our first assignment, this was our second assignment, which cancelled out this x	test
audio_0_135831.wav	so you will get delta zero is equal to eleven point five, four degree or point two radiant	test
audio_0_142762.wav	so look, this is this current is getting injected here, i one	test
audio_0_152047.wav	So, taking the Laplace transform we will get u 0 and s is equal to the Laplace transform of t that is 1 over s square	test
audio_0_151892.wav	So, if we substitute here u is equal to square root tau what we will get	test
audio_0_157624.wav	It didn't happen and there is an overlap that overlap interval many of the books call as mu	test
audio_0_23533.wav	Time	test
audio_0_162449.wav	So, in C++, you can perform fresh inference of types actually often without changing the value, because you often need to infer about type where you really do not want the value to change, you do not need the value to change, and we will show examples of that	test
audio_0_161753.wav	second cell value is twenty four, slack is zero, which means the solution three comma four uses up all the twenty one and twenty four resources	test
audio_0_19934.wav	That means breaking down the variance into its causes and try to know the reasons	test
audio_0_131268.wav	The 2nd issue is that authentication of these devices cannot be ignored, the fact is that these edge devices are quite critically connected to various components of process control system it could for example be connected to some of the actuators or monitoring elements in nuclear thermal plants, and therefore the data processing which is actually collected by this device is actively important for the functioning or the correctness of the entire plant	test
audio_0_124164.wav	That is why you see a bending	test
audio_0_3603.wav	To reduce the your eddy currents the core is made of thin laminations this is same everywhere, if you see all the machines you will find like this right	test
audio_0_146349.wav	not a very significant	test
audio_0_140071.wav	this should be volt per kilometer	test
audio_0_165746.wav	That is a common semantics	test
audio_0_162344.wav	There are some operators which are allowed to be overloaded like logical and logical or comma etcetera, but you have to keep in mind that if you overload them then their basic properties, some additional properties might get destroyed	test
audio_0_161894.wav	so it becomes dash	test
audio_0_172514.wav	So, save them as an a separate object copy to object	test
audio_0_114566.wav	If we do not want equal power division then Z1 will not be equal to this particular impedance which maybe let us says Z 2	test
audio_0_143106.wav	so in this you have tried to see the gauss seidel method, then newton raphson method and all the your necessary your derivation for law like line flows ride and your what you call line branch losses at the trying that pi equivalent ah model for a tap changing transformers, right, and this p and pqv bus	test
audio_0_18410.wav	Inventry levels are ignored here	test
audio_0_138681.wav	similarly, i c one, you can get now i c one is equal to beta, i a one, you will get four point six, four, angle one twenty eight point five degree ampere	test

audio_0_153667.wav	For example for air this ratio comes out to be 377 ohms	test
audio_0_164686.wav	And then the beauty of the whole thing is, you really do not need to know a lot of C++ to be able to use them, because their use their design and the way they are organised are quite intuitive and you can just study from the manual and start using them	test
audio_0_117442.wav	If the power is not very high then this cooling is provide through the metal casing of the transistor and it dissipates heat through the metal casing	test

audio_0_135425.wav	so this is the answer after fourth iteration	test
audio_0_26771.wav	so out of all these, you can realise that there are only 2, basically only 2 unknowns	test
audio_0_151963.wav	So, in that case, these Y s term will be similar here we will have 3 s minus 1 here also we have 3 s minus 1and then we can subtract from each other we will get the equation	test
audio_0_161317.wav	now what you do is go to this matrix	test
audio_0_154339.wav	So the representation of ensemble average by this symbol	test
audio_0_164311.wav	So, this should invoke that operator and print the B object which does connecting, but the interesting fact is that what happens, if you also write this	test
audio_0_156277.wav	And another purely frequency dependent part Z L	test
audio_0_160033.wav	in this case, b inverse is actually here	test
audio_0_123072.wav	So, two things you have to remember, frequency when I tellalk you to see frequency and the peak to peak voltage	test

audio_0_165055.wav	Where as in a different identical expression where the pointer still is of B star type, but when it invokes g given that the object it actually is pointing to is a d type object now the D colon colon g that is this overridden function in the derived class gets invoked	test
audio_0_125698.wav	Because here I D S S is constant; we know it	test
audio_0_164528.wav	But what I am trying to just show is here I have a bound set which is a specialization of set, this is templatized, this also is templatized and this has a part of it as a component is has a list which as a part of it has a vector	test
audio_0_163055.wav	So, the difference with the other operator array new and are overloaded array new will now be able to not only allocate a character array, but it will be also be able to fill it up with the given character at the initial time	test
audio_0_154843.wav	Here we have simply, instead of writing this gammak+1,k I've replaced this with k, that is the mismatch expression is replaced by this, just for convenience, we shall see this later	test
audio_0_161389.wav	now we say that we are going to make an assignment here	test

audio_0_133167.wav	Now in order to keep track of the mode of operation the ARM has a particular bit known as the NS bit so the NS bit present in the configuration register indicates whether it is a normal world or the operating world that is currently being executed	test
audio_0_168306.wav	So, it is done later on	test
audio_0_163795.wav	So, this is the placeholder for x	test
audio_0_154923.wav	I hope I am clear	test
audio_0_110445.wav	So, let us see AD minus BC is equal to 1 or not	test
audio_0_131834.wav	So, we recollect that, in the Linux systems the randomize va space would take 3 values 0, 1 or 2	test
audio_0_14987.wav	So, it is I starting S is equal to your 1, and this is r 1 right and this is x 1 plus x 2 dash this is r 2 dash and r 2 dash 1 upon S minus 1 S S is equal to 1, So this this part is 0	test
audio_0_158596.wav	for example, this will become f nine into b, three plus f, ten into e, three, so three into this	test
audio_0_142772.wav	so for the all bus, four, one, two, three, four, you have got this four equation, sets of equation, for the time being not putting any equation number, so this one from from this diagram, from this diagram you have got, we have got this one, this we have understood very easy, right, and from this you write down all this equation in terms of admittance, right line, admittance charging capacitance will come later	test
audio_0_119688.wav	And this is what we are going to study in this particular diagram, which is now in front of you	test
audio_0_3434.wav	Because we are assuming r 2 dash by S is much much greater than your x 2 dash, further is simplification and then therefore, I am not going to this equation again and again, just you write and put it you will get it right	test
audio_0_11376.wav	Then if you make it, it will be root 3 V L I L cos theta plus j root 3 V L I L sin theta	test
audio_0_169782.wav	Now, we understand what a initial value of a radiable with in a certain scope are what is a meaning of having a kind of initial or default for a parameter	test
audio_0_171505.wav	If you take the only the distance right, maybe they are very far	test
audio_0_135202.wav	and there also you have got where this here also, here also we have got: delta is equal to twenty degree	test
audio_0_153840.wav	So these are the similar, they are the same expression so itÕs not both these have to be satisfied any one of these with any one of these condition is satisfied then the network is said to be a reciprocal network	test
audio_0_172809.wav	So, you can combine the different lines; you can write a kind of programming, you can do loops and you can make program to run all these programming in any Linux systems	test
audio_0_144865.wav	so these are the qualities of a leaderships: how he can handle the situation, how he can make people understand and, of course, in all these activities the important thing is that he should have a good communication abilities	test
audio_0_158291.wav	So, this is VAN, VB V C N	test
audio_0_172911.wav	So, now, we can get the overall composition right take for example, if you have the 500 proteins or 1000 proteins, take all the proteins and you can take the overall composition right for the in the case of the helical proteins as well as for the a TMS proteins, fine	test
audio_0_151910.wav	So, today we will continue with integro differential equation, so in integro differential equation we will have differential term as well as integral term	test
audio_0_111997.wav	So, this is the expression for characteristic impedance	test
audio_0_101092.wav	What are its size, shape, composition and properties physical properties like stiffness, and how do molecular players dictate these properties, and how are these properties relevant to processes like migration to differentiation	test
audio_0_104957.wav	Prednisone, this is a glucocorticoid	test
audio_0_118261.wav	So, in this lecture, what we are going to do, we are ah going to start with the devices that we use for mixes, which are diodes and transistors	test
audio_0_132065.wav	So, when you run driver as follows where it to run we need to first set the LD library path lets set as follows leave it point to the entry and run it and what it means are the nodes in the doubly link list comprising of A, B and C, okay	test
audio_0_128306.wav	So, it is easy for me to talk, and easy for you to understand the function generator, all right	test
audio_0_128267.wav	So, we will see about that also	test
audio_0_148759.wav	one of the possible ways you can interpret the poem is by saying something like this that when one looks at the snow which is in the shoe right now, it looks like, ah, abandoned sparrows nest	test
audio_0_164072.wav	So, we pop 6 and 1, the stack becomes empty, we operate it with plus to get 7 and push it back and we proceed in this way to get the result	test
audio_0_124464.wav	The tube is in horizontal direction that is why it is called horizontal tube furnace	test
audio_0_138901.wav	so instead of cos hyperbolic we are writing cos beta x v r plus z c, j z c, rather j z c, sin beta x i r, because sin hyperbolic, sin gamma	test
audio_0_116919.wav	So, then at this point again the power gets divided part of that goes here part of that comes over here	test
audio_0_165228.wav	Call by reference; they have to be identical	test
audio_0_120693.wav	Because, they remember me, recognize me and those are the kind of social benefits of course, you can develop this much further you can develop	test
audio_0_10968.wav	Therefore, Z is equal to root over R square plus omega L square is equal to V m by I m	test
audio_0_104807.wav	Similarly FAK or paxillin both these proteins are known to bind to integrin, and at the same time they do not have trans membrane domains	test
audio_0_293.wav	So I mean it it approximately is good well separated but there is at least compared to the previous one one sample is here 13	test
audio_0_161149.wav	we did the same thing minus three x one, minus seven x four	test
audio_0_118417.wav	So, let us take both these cases and analyse further	test
audio_0_21831.wav	I am from Mumbai and I am 21 years old	test
audio_0_135268.wav	but here we have written delta one to delta, p e minus p i d delta	test
audio_0_28030.wav	this is basically your half plus half j, divided by 1 minus j um, which is basically equal to again just rewriting it using the properties of complex numbers that is, 1 plus j divided by 2, which is equal to, which is equal to 1 over 4 times 1 plus 1 plus j, times 1 plus j, which is 1 plus j square, And you can check	test
audio_0_15990.wav	Similarly here also it will be V by 40 this will be V by 40 right	test
audio_0_113512.wav	And this attenuation now is decreasing so you can see that in this particular region relatively attenuation is small	test
audio_0_160200.wav	the dual is shown here	test
audio_0_15857.wav	2 that we know the i is equal to dq by dt i is equal to dq by dt	test
audio_0_20031.wav	So, basically, the labor variance is divided into two causes, efficiency related causes and quantity or hour related causes	test
audio_0_156309.wav	And this you know at the point of oscillation you have to have your R in a modulus of R in greater than R L	test
audio_0_133164.wav	So for example whenever there is let us say that an interrupt occurs the first thing that gets executed is code present in the Monitor mode	test
audio_0_18419.wav	In our first two sessions of cost and management accounting we had discussed about what is is cost accounting, then what are the different classifications of costs	test
audio_0_102292.wav	So, the problem with this particular experiment, not the problem the caveat is that you cannot measure the forces directly	test
audio_0_134336.wav	It is initialised by this particular function va start and passed ap and format, it is initialised by this particular function known as va start and argument pointer is made to point to the first argument that is sent to printf in this case argument pointer is pointing to a	test
audio_0_138173.wav	and number four: the grounding impedance is reflected in the zero sequence network as three z n, although when we are drawing the diagram it is z n, but the grounding, your, what you call that grounding impedance, actually reflected in the zero sequence network as three z n	test
audio_0_27811.wav	Consider the transmission of capital N pilot symbols and therefore we can write the received symbol: y 1 equals h times x 1 plus v 1	test
audio_0_2868.wav	But as soon as speed will speed will pick up slowly and slowly you cut down the resistance and being the resistance r is to 0	test
audio_0_117753.wav	So, in generally you can use it for vehicle tracking remote monitoring location identification, even some people use it for people tracking also	test
audio_0_126098.wav	Because finally, we are applying DC voltage, we are applying voltage, we are using the equipment	test
audio_0_171484.wav	So, this is the residue number	test
audio_0_109842.wav	I have the expression	test
audio_0_12205.wav	So, it will be I 2 minus I 1 right	test
audio_0_17402.wav	Now same calculation please make it for 120 students	test
audio_0_172200.wav	So, do not keep both	test
audio_0_26692.wav	I have N, I have N observed symbols: Y1, Y2, YN, these are the	test
audio_0_104581.wav	So, the process literally in acts like a cop chasing a thief ok	test
audio_0_17509.wav	Now we want to give a better deal to employees and increase their wage rate to 4, the hourly variable over rate will remain same	test
audio_0_151034.wav	So another example is the gradient which we have learned in the last lecture	test
audio_0_103459.wav	So, for a solid you know that as soon as the force is applied you have an instantaneous deformation, and the deformation remains like that till the end or the duration over which the force is applied	test
audio_0_130815.wav	So with this we will actually wind up this particular lecture, so we had seen in this last two lectures about how heaps are managed and how you could actually use vulnerabilities in the program such as a double free vulnerability to exploit the heap, thank you	test
audio_0_163295.wav	If you look into this part, I need to provide all different names to these functions because they are different functions	test
audio_0_169306.wav	It does not work with object directly; it has to either have a pointer that you can cast or it has to have a reference that you can cast	test
audio_0_123022.wav	And we have applied plus minus 15, we have to apply plus minus 15, that is the biasing voltage that is the biasing voltage to the operational amplifier all right	test
audio_0_140744.wav	so that is that ah, your, what you call shunt capacitor	test
audio_0_110803.wav	So, the first step is choose the value of g s which is less than g s max then plot the constant g s circle and also plot NF circle	test
audio_0_166513.wav	So, finally, before I close, I would like to just give you glimpse of a issue of design choice, as to whether I am we can always model in terms of inheritance and in place of that we could also do composition the other way hierarchy	test
audio_0_114586.wav	So, whatever we give if I give the same input it will come over here	test

audio_0_155519.wav	Now on solving this equation we get this value, so the relationship between Z0 E and Z0 O is given by this where Z0 is the matching impedance or the impedance to which the coupler is connected at all the ports	test
audio_0_150519.wav	So, we define this function Gt as En t, En is defined already that is the difference between this fx and the polynomial Px	test
audio_0_128158.wav	So, high power application can be the limitations of monolithic ICs, where they cannot be used for high power applications	test
audio_0_139194.wav	this equation is called coordination equation	test
audio_0_17967.wav	The expectation of change is same for both	test
audio_0_123858.wav	Now, output voltage swing the output voltage, output voltage swing how we can define, the output kind swing all the way to the power supply rails right, cannot go all the way to plus 5 plus 15 minus 15 or whatever power supply we have given	test
audio_0_117166.wav	So, that is a transmission coefficient that 1 2	test
audio_0_159331.wav	so fifty plus zero is the value here, which is fifty	test
audio_0_145946.wav	tables and graphs make them colorful but understandable	test
audio_0_155340.wav	Similarly if we consider capacitance, then for Omega is equal to 0, it will be infinite impedance reactance and for omega is equal to Infinity, reactance will be 0	test
audio_0_151237.wav	So there would be just 2 times of the term	test
audio_0_16443.wav	Now, again let me clear it	test
audio_0_112906.wav	See, if everything is reflected back; then, we can conceptually say well infinite power is available	test
audio_0_153570.wav	That means, this if we substitute this x y z from this curve, this will satisfy the given equation for all t	test
audio_0_137665.wav	if you do so, that will be the expression for p two, one	test
audio_0_131130.wav	So, we will now go to the attack code it is over here and we will just jump directly to the attack function and what we see is the following	test
audio_0_158580.wav	and than we formulated with three variables: x, one, x, two x, three, as the distance cycled by a, distance cycle by b and distance cycle by c	test
audio_0_156027.wav	Band width of the quarter wave transformer	test
audio_0_104187.wav	So, the question the authors asked was given that within in vivo you have orders of magnitude	test
audio_0_158285.wav	So it will essentially conduct for 120 degrees	test
audio_0_128780.wav	And you will see a black and if you focus right here where my nail is there right here, there is a silver ring	test
audio_0_109362.wav	This is a nominal resistance of the material and a nominal expected definition of the load and we use factors on the nominal load, the nominal load effect because we are looking at bending moments, we're looking at axial forces or shear forces and the factored resistance and compare the factored load and the factored resistance to ensure safety	test
audio_0_100332.wav	875 into hard into 1 5 and on simplification it is coming to be around 9 months so for this transaction project having 38,000 lines or 3080 KSLOC and productivity of 400 SOLOC for staff month we get that that the effort is estimated to be 100 staff months and meantime is estimated to be nine months so similar, similar examples are there	test
audio_0_132510.wav	Since this is the first malloc that is done in the program therefore in this particular point in time the list has just one chunk that is available and that chunk is x	test
audio_0_11497.wav	14 and angle will be tan inverse your what you call minus 10 by 10 because it is 10 minus j 10	test
audio_0_17754.wav	So, now variable component of RM, you know that as per the given information 90% was variable	test
audio_0_21652.wav	So this is on web platform right, it can be linked to google drive	test
audio_0_2091.wav	So this imaging system it it it calibrates everything	test
audio_0_115735.wav	So, we take the projection over here and then draw a line like this here	test
audio_0_170277.wav	Now, Naturally if we perceive it that way then we need this member function to be present in the mobile phone class and the question is this member function should it be in public, answer is no because we have already defined the interface	test
audio_0_102956.wav	So, now one of the striking observations in these experiments is that the decision to differentiate into an adipose cell versus an osteoblast is often dependent on the “Cell Density”	test
audio_0_12569.wav	So, that is that is what we have done in that here right	test
audio_0_154907.wav	Now imagine this is the signal flow graphs diagram which we were considering earlier	test
audio_0_16269.wav	Next one is series and parallel capacitors	test
audio_0_118669.wav	Firstly, we introduce the interface of CST microwave studio	test
audio_0_155392.wav	GT Max becomes simply equal to S21 upon S12	test
audio_0_16285.wav	So, v is equal to I told you v 1 plus v 2 up to v n Now, for k th capacitor we know the voltage v is equal to 1 upon c t 0 to t it dt right we know that	test
audio_0_156085.wav	Now what happens is that the problem with this setup is somewhat like this actually	test
audio_0_168341.wav	We use ‘printf’ from the stdio library and print the hello world on to the terminal or which is formally set to with the stdio out file	test
audio_0_23467.wav	So, it’s a good tip to have a measurable parameter, so that we can track what is going on	test
audio_0_159286.wav	so divide every element of the pivot by the pivot element	test
audio_0_108380.wav	Of course, you can use a parabolic strain curve and make your calculations	test
audio_0_20681.wav	And this is the fast neutron production because of the decay of plutonium 239	test
audio_0_161075.wav	so we need to understand that the primal has two variables: x one and x two	test
audio_0_142575.wav	so this thing	test
audio_0_134381.wav	So, using the same approach that we have done previously we can use % n to actually change or modify some arbitrary memory location	test
audio_0_138873.wav	in that case, instead of cos hyperbolic x we are putting cos beta x for a loss less line	test
audio_0_162135.wav	Next like any other C++ group of functions the constructors can also be overloaded, which mean that x class can more than one constructor because necessarily being a constructor it has the same name as the class name, so if I want to write two constructor they will necessarily have the same name, but it is permitted to do so as long as they deferred in the number of parameters or types of parameters and so on	test
audio_0_120022.wav	And strategy therefore, is seeing from a systems perspective, the ability to see what is and what could be by analyzing what if's and then make choices	test
audio_0_110106.wav	We could simplify the expression a little	test
audio_0_169978.wav	This discussion will tell you that it is actually not possible to overload the IO operator using member function either in the O stream class or in the user defined type	test
audio_0_153084.wav	We know already that is a factorial n over s plus a this plus a is coming because of this shift there	test
audio_0_112968.wav	So, the shunt capacitance you can see that b value will be 0	test
audio_0_29029.wav	so in this particular case, the time that is required will be the time from when that event is sensed, that peace of data is sent to the cloud	test
audio_0_127907.wav	These are the ingredients used to make this delicious tea	test
audio_0_123522.wav	It is a filter that significantly attenuates	test
audio_0_171490.wav	So, they use 5 and 6 right they use the I plus 3 and I plus 4	test
audio_0_103096.wav	So, you have your substrate and your protein is anchored right	test
audio_0_116804.wav	So, it has a higher frequency hence it has a higher energy and it can break the bond	test
audio_0_130097.wav	So, if you have 0 to 1 kilohertz as frequency, and I want to pass only frequency from 0 to 200 hertz and any frequency about 200 hertz should not be passed, then I can design a low pass filter	test
audio_0_117393.wav	What is S 21	test
audio_0_117975.wav	We can take Z O 2 as 10 and then this will be 40 known	test
audio_0_2183.wav	So obviously, the total is calculated here of all these values	test
audio_0_153861.wav	Now consider that in addition to N dash the port N dash we also have another port N double dash where the current is non zero	test
audio_0_168502.wav	I would first want you to look at the left part of the code only do not look at this part, do not look at this part, this part as if it is not there	test
audio_0_10567.wav	If you entry at this you will get your tau is equal to R C that time constant half C V 0 square into 1 minus e to the power minus 2 t upon tau	test
audio_0_155027.wav	Say, if matching required is 50 ohms, then there are 2 kinds of conductors, this part is just a metal and this part is a material of higher resistivity and when both can combine, there will be a matched load	test
audio_0_153683.wav	when every time d increases by lambda/2 we get the same value of Zd	test
audio_0_131897.wav	So this SECS structure contains global and meta data about that particular enclave, it is used by various reasons to such as to ensure the integrity of the code and data present in the enclave and it is also used for mapping information to the various enclave regions	test
audio_0_126940.wav	This lecture let us concentrate on input offset current	test
audio_0_155199.wav	And this I just stated the formula for the LI of a band pass filter	test
audio_0_143741.wav	we know that biological factors of resilience is suggested by neural, neuroendocrine and immune system functions relation to stress activity	test
audio_0_137499.wav	so this term your will increase, right	test
audio_0_160407.wav	zeros were available, so we had to make arbitrary assignments which lead to alternate optimum solutions	test
audio_0_112214.wav	So, we have actually designed a general purpose pcb and I just want to mention to you that this general pcb we had designed for low pass filter, bandpass filter, band reject filter , attenuators also which we will discuss in the later lectures	test
audio_0_10643.wav	So, you have to find out v 1 and v 2 right and this current i C is showing to both to your for C 1 and C 2 both are in series so, both C 1 and C 2	test
audio_0_155134.wav	Well, that can act as a series resonator or a shunt resonator depending on the frequency	test
audio_0_107401.wav	When it crushes you have overturning of the system and that is how the loss of stability is going to actually progress	test
audio_0_3931.wav	So, i 3 plus 3 I is equal to this I actually here it is a dependent your what you call dependent current source right	test
audio_0_163734.wav	So, I would like to given a, and b, I would like write max a plus plus, b plus plus thinking that this will give me the maximum value from the original value if a, and b and then it will give me the incremented value	test
audio_0_165620.wav	This eventually turns out to be an infinite loop and it could not have worked	test
audio_0_171921.wav	5 Å between cG and the CD1 like we have this angle how many atoms you require 3 right	test
audio_0_106831.wav	So, you have the reaction plane, you have the load line and you are subjecting the plane what is referred to as a splitting plane in the figure to compression	test
audio_0_161092.wav	now i will go back and say that if i have this primal, now if i want to right the dual, the primal has two constraints	test
audio_0_143482.wav	so basically it is: your d s is equal to your r zero into d into r, zero into d to the power, one by four, right, one by four	test
audio_0_128385.wav	Next 1 please, sSo, next white button you can see you have, if you wantcan to create an offset, you can create a offset by again changing the manual trigger or by using the display key the other push buttonskey, all right	test
audio_0_135502.wav	so here we are writing this: l f is equal to	test
audio_0_112970.wav	So, this is the value of the capacitance which has to be put a shunt	test
audio_0_110459.wav	So, here a 1 is the incoming wave	test
audio_0_151639.wav	And, also the function was continuous in each open interval so the boundedness is guaranteed and the integrability over the closed interval is also guaranteed as a result of this boundedness	test
audio_0_129744.wav	And this will or this may cause trapped charges in MOSFET	test
audio_0_166173.wav	So, as such function returns only one value	test
audio_0_154845.wav	Let us see what are the implications of these expressions	test
audio_0_102433.wav	So, he used this pore experiment again you have these pores, 3 micron or 8 micron pores, from which you transition the cell you pass the cell through these pores and during this process	test
audio_0_1654.wav	So the length of the vector in this particular diagram is showing the magnitude showing the number of pixels or even you can add those magnitudes of gradient to to get the magnitude of this histogram to get that angle histogram	test
audio_0_130602.wav	So, now in the next module what we will see	test
audio_0_110671.wav	So, conversion loss was around 12	test
audio_0_152279.wav	So, again we have so seen that the v also satisfies the Laplace equation	test
audio_0_117073.wav	So, let us see here what are S 21 and S 31	test
audio_0_104874.wav	So, L as a function of time t	test
audio_0_100711.wav	So, in skeletal muscle cells you have in adhesion to integrins which link the inside	test
audio_0_133139.wav	So, in prior years previous prior to the System on Chip type of architecture you would have a different IC present for each of these modules and therefore the size of your entire design would be quite large right	test
audio_0_129165.wav	So, I will write it down here once again	test
audio_0_166121.wav	But, unfortunately the values, actual parameters have not been swapped	test
audio_0_116154.wav	2 dB over here, but this here shows from 0 to 10 gigahertz that is a very large frequency range	test
audio_0_156639.wav	Then we have noise or as we call Noise figure	test
audio_0_10837.wav	So, what you can do the easiest way, rather than complicating the thing	test
audio_0_170919.wav	And if you get these structures you can get the atomic coordinates and this can be used for docking of small ligands or you can see the interactions, because you will get the high quality structures	test
audio_0_104757.wav	So, if I were to imagine the focal adhesion as a 3D entity, where are each of these proteins present	test
audio_0_139901.wav	that mean this equation that cos i minus v, cos i cos v plus sin i sin v	test
audio_0_115714.wav	So, just think about this 1 linear array	test
audio_0_120256.wav	But, this is a new way of buying or enjoying music may be even not buying, but basically consumption of music in a new way	test
audio_0_113410.wav	So, from here we went to y, in y we added something	test
audio_0_172434.wav	So, you can get the energy map you can see some of them more green they are accessible and the red one right which are having the high energy system	test
audio_0_102998.wav	Once again Adipogenic differentiation dropped, this is my adipo differentiation	test
audio_0_143085.wav	that is q two, right, that you can easily find out, because, ah, all the all the real power and reactive power injections of the load flow studies have been given	test
audio_0_133213.wav	So, examples of having a full OS is that it will have complete	test
audio_0_10959.wav	So, let me delete it, so that means from which you will get that your v is equal to v is equal to I m root over R square plus omega L square sin omega t plus theta	test
audio_0_114624.wav	So, you can see that the length will be same lambda by 4, but it is now little bent over here	test
audio_0_164457.wav	In terms of instantiation this you know lazy instantiation is something which is often very useful	test
audio_0_28988.wav	so this will be on the raspberry pi, this is the client code, and on the server side you will be getting your data, as your covered in the last lecture, and for the plot you will be getting something like this: left one side is the temperature plot, the right one side is the humidity plot	test
audio_0_110701.wav	After that we defined signal to noise ratio and noise figure	test
audio_0_157771.wav	So please note that now if I am applying completely a sinusoidal voltage because there is no control at all, my current will also be definitely sinusoidal	test
audio_0_2727.wav	The average mammalian genome mutation rate is 2	test
audio_0_122448.wav	And the result is this fantastic example of creation of a great enterprise across the world influencing large number of countries providing all kinds of eye care very intricate processes	test
audio_0_128991.wav	Then we go to DC voltages, DC voltage starts from 200 millivolts 2 volts 20 volts 200 volts one 1000 volts, right	test
audio_0_116989.wav	Now, let us do for odd mode	test
audio_0_141291.wav	so now this is the single phase diagram	test
audio_0_117748.wav	In fact, nowadays even combined GPS and GSM modules are also available	test
audio_0_156093.wav	In fact, so significant is this distortion produced by this effect this intermodulation, this effect is known as intermodulation	test
audio_0_158930.wav	so the dual will have y one, y two and v one, v two	test
audio_0_118806.wav	So, I did not change the material for this	test
audio_0_120303.wav	Hello, I am Jayanta Chatterjee from IIT Kanpur, we are discussing for the last several weeks and we will continue to discuss for the next few weeks, this interesting topic of Managing Services in today’s world and the contemporary issues	test
audio_0_23490.wav	So, if you have a high number of notes	test
audio_0_27159.wav	we have already evaluated the cofactor of 5 by 4	test
audio_0_160934.wav	for example, this figure eight would be the cost of giving job one to person number one	test
audio_0_17376.wav	It becomes a semi variable cost	test
audio_0_139484.wav	so the conductor resistance is affected by three factors: one is the frequency, second is the spiralling and third is the temperature	test
audio_0_153355.wav	So if you want to find the inverse Laplace transform for instance of this function which is 6 over 2s minus 3 and 8 minus 6 s divided by 16 s square plus 9	test
audio_0_173240.wav	So, due to the availability of data, the taxonomists first they start, they started to construct trees right	test
audio_0_143374.wav	so here we write this equation: when x is equal to l, v x is equal to v s and i l is equal to i s, so v s is equal to	test
audio_0_168100.wav	At this point, you have feeling little lost in terms of the hierarchy, it will good to take a print out of that slide and keep it by the side, so that you can quickly refer to it	test
audio_0_126780.wav	Here you may have lot of questions, but let you wait have some patience until we read to the lecture where I explain you how you can fabricate our MOSFET, alright	test
audio_0_172237.wav	So, finally, you can see here this one cluster, here this another cluster and put the third cluster	test
audio_0_107812.wav	So, merely by adding up the three bilinear curves of each peer, in this case we have arrived at the lateral force capacity of this wall itself	test
audio_0_160057.wav	so we have to ask another question: how is this going to help us in our learning of linear programming and operations research	test
audio_0_170065.wav	But in actuality it could be a engineer object or it could be a manager object I do not know what it is, but unless I know that I do not know whether this function should be called or this function should be called I have no idea	test
audio_0_150020.wav	So here, in this example, we want to evaluate for instance this f t is equal to 1, the constant function 1 which is defined for all t positive	test
audio_0_17962.wav	Now calculate it for the other company which is Q	test
audio_0_16711.wav	Because, frequency is 2 omega right double frequency; that means, in what; that means, this each one is a quarter your what you call your quarter cycle	test
audio_0_126286.wav	So, if I apply this if I write this values I can find out the noise voltage which is 0	test
audio_0_108569.wav	It's the same table where you look at the eccentricity ratio as estimated varying between no eccentricity to an eccentricity of one third or even one quarter, one half and then different slenderness ratios going all the way from 6 to 27	test
audio_0_26454.wav	Remember this is h hat, which is, let us not forget, what these are	test
audio_0_154769.wav	So comes in summery commensurate filters are frequently used for synthesising various or realising the lumped element equivalent in terms of distributed circuit elements	test
audio_0_11431.wav	If now, if both the your what you call now if both if the same power loss is tolerated for both the system that is P loss is equal to P loss dash	test
audio_0_155854.wav	But the important thing to note here is that when we discuss about this stability circle we divide the smith chart in various region potentially unstable or stable regions and do not get any unique solution for the stable or unstable regions	test
audio_0_163809.wav	In cases, you cannot because of you want to mean something different or you want to mix up certain types and do some conversion, you will have to use the explicit instantiation	test
audio_0_10882.wav	So, it is minus 18 watt this is actually what you call the power supplied by the, this is absorbed and this is minus sign means power supplied	test
audio_0_106690.wav	So, the tensile force that this cross section will equilibrate is equal to the sum of the area of cross section of all the bars, all the bars should have yielded into the yield strength of the bars, equilibrated by the compressive strength	test
audio_0_157438.wav	Automatically this current will start flowing from the machine into converter 2	test
audio_0_141738.wav	i r is equal to three hundred, this three phase ampere	test

audio_0_22056.wav	We are going to do the testing phase of the design problem that my team took up in the last phase, which was related to education about note taking and we arrived at a solution some, not solution in its entirety, they still in its raw form	test
audio_0_104710.wav	So, vinculin is a 120 kilo delta protein again localizing at focal adhesions, again it interacts with many focal adhesions proteins actin	test
audio_0_172099.wav	So, in the last lecture, do you remember, what did we discuss in the last lecture	test
audio_0_153767.wav	A special chart which does this transformation for all impedances is what is known as a Smith chart	test
audio_0_132141.wav	The first invocation of func works as follows	test
audio_0_25401.wav	rather, This is equal to well, multiplying 3 by 2 minus 3 by 2, j and half j, and this is 0 and this is 3 by 10 minus 1 by 10 times j	test
audio_0_153422.wav	So, this is the product of s minus 5 and s plus 2 we can factorize that and again we have to go for the partial fractions that means A over this s plus A over s plus 2	test
audio_0_102704.wav	So, one of the techniques which has been employed exhaustively for studying the unfolding dynamics of various proteins is atomic force microscopy	test
audio_0_165477.wav	So it goes to handle that, and what is a handle do	test
audio_0_162636.wav	So, in terms of private inheritance always keep this concept in mind By symmetry that the third form of inheritance that C++ provide, where instead of writing public or private we could also write protected at the this point of inheritance structure	test
audio_0_130870.wav	So, we see that as keys are being pressed what the prime and probe application sees is that there is an increase in execution time during a particular place	test
audio_0_172764.wav	sixth column	test
audio_0_112978.wav	Z L in parallel with capacitance and then in series with inductor	test
audio_0_110006.wav	So, you have toe going towards increased compression levels and can fail in crushing	test
audio_0_132022.wav	So we have taken this particular example where a which is secret has a value of 0110 and the attacker has somehow due to the fault injection change the value of a to 0010	test
audio_0_105824.wav	IS 4326 as far as masonry constructions are concerned categorizes buildings from A to E	test
audio_0_13483.wav	That polar form; that means, this one polar form is convenient to a to display 2 parts of a phasor namely it is magnitude and phase angle	test
audio_0_141750.wav	so magnitude v s is one twenty point two k v	test
audio_0_10134.wav	So, in that case you directly add this one, you will get R g plus j x g plus X L	test
audio_0_118630.wav	The combined action of these three result in a structure resembling the moving spokes of a wheel	test
audio_0_108477.wav	So, we are talking of wherever you are placing reinforcement in a groove, ensure that at the top and the bottom, if it is horizontally placed, you are 15 m m at the top in the bottom, whereas 20 m m on the sides in the cross section as cover provided by concrete to the steel reinforcement	test
audio_0_142505.wav	this is the output voltage, right	test
audio_0_112256.wav	And firstly just design substrate	test
audio_0_163138.wav	This is the process of overload resolution	test
audio_0_162350.wav	So, if you overload those behaviors will get lost, you will have to be careful that after you overload those behaviors cannot be assumed	test
audio_0_114524.wav	So, it should act like a band pass filter	test
audio_0_12197.wav	Before doing anything I am just trying to tell you suppose this is only 1 1 winding is there that you can see only 1 winding	test
audio_0_20364.wav	We have analyzed this equation and from there we have identified the condition of prompt criticality to be something like rho equal to beta; that is, as long as the reactivity is less than the delayed neutron fraction or at the limiting case it is equal to delayed neutrons fraction, then we have sufficient time to activate our control mechanism and it is possible to control the reactor	test
audio_0_106627.wav	We examined walls, the different types of walls possible	test
audio_0_102672.wav	So, this RGD is actually hidden within this structure	test
audio_0_110573.wav	So, I will choose a normal port small signal port for RF and then, I will choose harmonic port which is port 3 for LO	test

audio_0_130328.wav	So, from the beginning without applying gate to gate to source voltage, without applying drain to source voltage if there is a channel in the beginning its a depletion type, if there is no channel it is your enhancement type	test
audio_0_134988.wav	not shown here also, right	test
audio_0_2563.wav	So, simply stating we want to achieve the target of quality characteristic, but at the same time, we want to minimize the variation in the products functional characteristics and that is typically because we wanted to have a minimum quality loss associated with this particular product	test
audio_0_162609.wav	So, you can practice at a later point of time Now coming to private the restricted forms of inheritance let me first discuss about private inheritance	test
audio_0_111157.wav	So, and that is easy to check these the things are available on the internet or on the smartphone you can actually say a star hash 0 7 hash and then you can check the SAR value	test
audio_0_128342.wav	So, these are knobs, you can you can change the knob, and you will be able to see the change in the frequency	test
audio_0_124387.wav	If this is the case, if you want to clean the chemical oxides from the native oxides we can have thickness of about 1 nanometer	test
audio_0_102420.wav	So, this event is a nuclear rupture event	test
audio_0_11973.wav	I mean, you take all the value i 1, i 2, i 3 up to i n and i n divided by your n you have to consider up to this time interval up to n	test
audio_0_122703.wav	So, that is why, you will see that in the brochures of educational institutes, there will be statements from alumni, there will be statements from people who have recruited students from that institute and so on	test
audio_0_23759.wav	Shyam: As there will be like homeworks as well	test
audio_0_133589.wav	So, there are 3 different types of integer overflow vulnerabilities	test

audio_0_102044.wav	So, this is no mean task	test
audio_0_11500.wav	Now, therefore, I t is equal to it is look first as it is mentioned in terms of time	test
audio_0_17905.wav	First of all, out of last year's power and fuel cost, apply the percentage of variability	test
audio_0_10165.wav	This way we have seen in our theory therefore, total impedance will be Z g plus Z l Z g is 10 plus j 20 and Z L will be 10 minus j 20, so minus j 20 plus j 20 cancels it will be 20 ohm	test
audio_0_759.wav	5562, which is also, it is much less than the first component, but still it has some significant component	test
audio_0_128665.wav	Typically, the value of input capacitance for LM741 is 1	test
audio_0_10981.wav	So, if you take in terms of your, what you call in the phasor that, when you draw the phasor diagram, so generally we can write i is equal to I m by root 2 that rms value, and its angle will be 0 degree	test
audio_0_100778.wav	This is another example for chondrocyte and the matrix secreted by it	test
audio_0_106877.wav	I'm not interested how much the, in this test I'm not interested in understanding how much the brick itself is going to absorb	test
audio_0_133848.wav	So, resetting would imply that we would need to flush the pipeline we need to save the current state of the entire system so that when the power is turned on again the hardware device can actually continue to execute from where it had stopped	test
audio_0_23523.wav	Why we are doing this is that the ideal scores, I mean the ideal situation that you want to be in is that you want the high scores and lowest number of notes shared because	test
audio_0_24330.wav	So, design thinking as we probably will see is dated way back, so, I did mention about the 60s, but probably the dates even that we will reserve that for later	test
audio_0_169694.wav	So, you have one header file Solver dot h, which gives a interface of that function or the prototype of the function with all different parameters	test
audio_0_150620.wav	So, in this case this z equal to 0 is a non isolated singular point	test
audio_0_112162.wav	Let us say we want to use a bend in a micro strip line now one possibility is that we use right angle bend I generally do not recommend this particular thing	test
audio_0_4131.wav	whatever I told you just this is my V n b and their magnitude V n b actually magnitude V n b is equal to V p, V n also V p and V b n also magnitude V p right this is magnitude whether you get this direction or that direction in material	test
audio_0_166855.wav	And, here the output is critical to be able to understand what is happening	test
audio_0_115825.wav	So, if we substitute the value of s equal to j omega over here, we can say h j omega is nothing but 1 over 1 plus j omega	test
audio_0_138810.wav	this is the z bus, z bus matrix, also referred to as the open circuit impedance matrix	test
audio_0_100285.wav	We have to a generic model is there and why we want to customize it according to our own needs	test
audio_0_106655.wav	However, that is not a very successful typology due to issues that we'll examine in a moment	test
audio_0_103319.wav	So, there must be something which is different in the solid and the liquid, but can we say an ECM network like a collagen gel is a solid or a liquid or something in between	test
audio_0_26697.wav	Now let me denote this vector vector of the received symbol as your vector Y bar	test
audio_0_100053.wav	The best case is about 8 lakhs annual income where the worst case is what 1 lakh dollar per annum and here the best case is chance is 10 percent where the worst case chance is 30 percent	test
audio_0_165443.wav	Now, whatever g has to do; now the whole thing has already taken place, the error happened, it was reported, it has been detected here, it has been handled here, you recovered and you are proceeding to this part	test
audio_0_13185.wav	So, at the time of switching on it will be 10 u t minus u 3 right, plus and at the time of switching off at t equal to 6 second it will be minus 10 u t minus 6	test
audio_0_103075.wav	Now, if you pull this long of protein, and you have a z position, if you pull this long of protein one thing that you observe, one thing that you observe is you will get these multiple peaks	test
audio_0_105305.wav	So, you're really talking of the elastic and creep shortening as you have compressive loading and the thermal effects and the shrinkage effects together deciding how much of volume change is going to happen in the motor itself	test
audio_0_104406.wav	So, this shows the Matrix, which is secreted by fibroblasts	test
audio_0_126111.wav	You can see we will see an oscilloscope and we will observe the output of operational amplifier	test
audio_0_100215.wav	It provides no details, no detail basis for justifying the decisions or estimates	test
audio_0_108735.wav	This, the prescription of longitudinal bars again as we have seen for IS 4326 comes back here depending on the category of the building, the bar diameter is prescribed	test
audio_0_149582.wav	And we want to perform three iterations using this initial guess	test
audio_0_112885.wav	The reason for that is the load may not be in our hand, the load may change depending upon the requirement	test
audio_0_172906.wav	For example if you see the leucine this is the 0	test
audio_0_28616.wav	And why is this important	test
audio_0_136953.wav	this one after fault is clear, after fault, and this is post fault, right	test
audio_0_151153.wav	So I thank you for your attention	test
audio_0_123709.wav	We will see how it can be used as signal generator, filters we can design using op amp and we will take an example also, we take example also	test
audio_0_105016.wav	So, deflection set point is the force with which you are proving your sample	test
audio_0_110897.wav	Then we choose appropriate value of gamma s depending upon what is more important	test
audio_0_22895.wav	This looks like a fan	test
audio_0_4762.wav	But here it is written here whatever I said here it is written here right	test
audio_0_143294.wav	then this distance actually we are measuring from the receiving end to the sending end	test
audio_0_19669.wav	So, 1 lakh upon 5,000 means 20 rupees per unit is a rent cost which is charged on the production cost	test
audio_0_127321.wav	Let us see one more example, let us see one more example and the example is how do input bias currents I b 1 and I b 2 affect the amplifier operation if this is the question right to understand, to understand the effect of bias current and op amp, let us consider a inverting configuration	test
audio_0_155576.wav	Now because this is a simple, there is a simple network connection between the input RF and the output and the simple network connection is enforced by these wires which are connected between them, between the arms of the coupler	test
audio_0_165562.wav	Finally, before we conclude you would like to note that there are several advantages of this try catch for mechanism	test
audio_0_155536.wav	So, so in summary we saw that couplers represent 4 port microwave devices and there are various kinds of couplers, 90¡ couplers are one which provide phase shift of 90¡ between the coupled and through ports, 180 daily couplers are ones which provide 180¡ phase shift between coupled and through ports	test
audio_0_108701.wav	Now what this represents is the percentage of resisting area available in a plan configuration	test
audio_0_24663.wav	So 10 courses means 10 deadlines	test
audio_0_20175.wav	We everyone probably has seen this particular image, following the bombardment or following the atomic bomb, atomic bombing at Hiroshima on the 6th of August 1945	test
audio_0_139968.wav	but to get this transmission loss formula we have to make few	test
audio_0_119793.wav	So, whether there is a correlation between delight satisfaction in the customers mind with the financial performance, business performance of service organization	test
audio_0_22022.wav	Like in school there is always books, you have a particular book that is different scenario	test
audio_0_142895.wav	so let me go back to equation fourteen	test
audio_0_328.wav	We will get the skew symmetric matrix which is performing the equivalent cross product operations with the vectors	test
audio_0_147301.wav	now, the reflective believes that the primary purpose of communication is the maintenance or advancement of the personal relationship	test
audio_0_141863.wav	it is mathematics little bit you have to understood, right	test
audio_0_28942.wav	we need to import the random function first, sorry, starting and ending	test
audio_0_168723.wav	Based on this we have outline the principle of information highly where we have prescribed that we should always have the attributes or data members as private and the methods as public giving us the basic hiding of the state from the behavior of the object	test
audio_0_2440.wav	So, this is the complete coverage on this particular region you know happens actually, because of that	test
audio_0_16312.wav	So; that means, voltage remain same and this is Ceq equivalent for parallel connection	test
audio_0_152838.wav	So, you multiplied by delta x and divide by delta x	test
audio_0_171105.wav	Cluster we have the clustering; see similarity we take the similarity of 40 percent or 30 percent	test
audio_0_169586.wav	One function cannot be written, which can draw all three of them	test
audio_0_162739.wav	So, the z comes from A, which is public, it should have been accessible, but what has happened in the process of inheritance you have inherited it as a protected inheritance; C is inheriting A through the protected manner	test
audio_0_162510.wav	So, it needs a pointer of type A star const, but you have a pointer of this type	test
audio_0_115080.wav	So, we had giving a input here this is known as port 2 which is a through put or also known as coupled port	test
audio_0_164305.wav	Now, interestingly this being a friend function is as it is not available to class D because this function as we know actually is a global function it is just a friend	test
audio_0_169931.wav	So friend gives us a very elegant solution for the whole a requirement and we will be able to achieve exactly what we needed without breaking the encapsulation that we were requiring earlier	test
audio_0_109403.wav	To estimate the self weight, the dead load due to the self weight, the unit weight of masonry can be considered to be 20 kilo Newton per meter cube and the prism strength of masonry is 8 megapascals	test
audio_0_18647.wav	The intention of budget is to achieve certain goal and you can make variety of budgets	test
audio_0_20835.wav	It can supply a continuous amount of electricity throughout the year without being bothered about the surrounding or environment or any other demographic issues etc	test
audio_0_26080.wav	So this, let us clarify this also capital XL is loaded the terminology used is loaded on to the Lth	test
audio_0_112849.wav	So, hence this term comes over here you can see that is a product of these 2 terms over here	test
audio_0_110030.wav	We use equivalent stress block parameters, write down the equilibrium in the stress block and then use that with respect to the crushing strength of masonry to be able to arrive at the ultimate lateral force or represent in terms of the ultimate moment at which failure is occurring	test
audio_0_141161.wav	no, v phase v, v v into v conjugate is v square right	test
audio_0_24512.wav	So, some feedback that I have received in terms of students learning is that they often especially today these days often go online or check a YouTube video to understand the concept better or is there a some topic that is little ambiguous in what they are learning, they would probably be doing that so some that might be something that could fit into this learning activity	test
audio_0_167017.wav	Then in the derived class let us say you do not have member function at all just ignore this part, this you should not consider right now	test
audio_0_101273.wav	So, they then experiment with lamin A/C knock down cells also found that with this on the circular patterns the extent of area fluctuation increased, increased then did experiments by perturbing Nesprin and still they observed area fluctuations	test
audio_0_172662.wav	So, also use option printf; in the earlier cases when you print, which command we used	test
audio_0_130707.wav	So, in assembly language program	test
audio_0_117381.wav	And remember S parameters are defined when this port is terminated into the characteristic impedance which is Z 0	test
audio_0_118364.wav	So, in the secondary of the transformer, you have RF as plus minus and plus minus, so both this RF signals appear across this diodes in out of phase manner, and that is why the RF currents actually circulate among these diodes, and we call this as a balancing action	test
audio_0_2751.wav	So, you understand	test
audio_0_168356.wav	Void is where you would need to use a type, you can use the type void, but it actually says that there is no type	test
audio_0_115110.wav	So, in series we know that capacitances get divided	test
audio_0_2322.wav	So, the methodology that is typically used for the process FMEA is to again, you know the philosophy is really the characterization of various potential failures, and its causes of a particular system ok	test
audio_0_171763.wav	So, you can have the values right these are the structures right, which you can have the similar structures right	test
audio_0_130386.wav	Voltage that results in significant amount of current to flow from source to drain	test
audio_0_15132.wav	156 degree right, so angle and it is ohm	test
audio_0_168354.wav	Other data types in C include void	test
audio_0_171189.wav	So, here you can see with respect to temperature versus heat capacity	test
audio_0_159087.wav	so dual simplex ensure that the dual was always feasible and the primal was infeasible and finally we brought it towards feasibility	test
audio_0_167953.wav	If the compiler finds that inlineing it has problems or inlineing it does not really help the efficiency	test
audio_0_156509.wav	But because of this bend present in the curve, 1st of all we know that there are certain frequencies which are forbidden	test
audio_0_125868.wav	What will be a stop band	test
audio_0_12152.wav	So, 10 Ampere; that means, you will allow that 10 Ampere current to flow right	test
audio_0_103691.wav	So, if you plot the velocity profile the velocity profile will be something like this	test
audio_0_158591.wav	now this three constraints have to be rewritten	test
audio_0_133561.wav	So, if you recollect this is the BA parts which are present, then we will copy the shellcode on to the large string	test
audio_0_152600.wav	So if this F is continuous velocity filled for example of a fluid and the rho is the density of the fluid at a point x y z	test
audio_0_18178.wav	Now, if you go by total costing, you will feel that the sale is 2 crores, cost of manufacture is 1	test
audio_0_27625.wav	So minus 3 dB noise variance basically implies that sigma square is approximately equal to half	test
audio_0_137798.wav	if you take its magnitude, it is never one right, but you have to make it one	test
audio_0_117429.wav	And it is a figure of merit of power amplifier	test
audio_0_26105.wav	So first you take the symbols which are loaded on to the subcarriers, perform the IFFT	test
audio_0_25278.wav	this row vector is nothing but C bar transpose, that is, transpose of the equaliser vector times y bar of k	test
audio_0_157108.wav	In all probability my electronic circuit which is actually this control circuit that may not be able to give even that 1 ampere	test
audio_0_153331.wav	So, having this and we will take this s as s naught plus this n plus 1	test
audio_0_164744.wav	Now, which we are using to invoke, earlier we were doing in terms of p A now, we are doing in terms of p B	test
audio_0_151783.wav	So, this is the final answer for the Laplace transform of such a square wave function with period capital T	test
audio_0_164056.wav	So, first we will have to multiply 2 with 3, get the result 6 and then we have a plus and a minus which both of which has a same precedence, but they are left associative	test
audio_0_131320.wav	So, while it is easy to understand that n that is the number of stages in ring oscillator upends the frequency, the delay of each inverter that is t actually depends upon the fabrication process of these gates	test
audio_0_171776.wav	Residue which perform catalysis	test
audio_0_14071.wav	ah The way I told, same way it is written right	test
audio_0_111156.wav	However do not be too much afraid also there is a safety margin of 3 to 4; that means, really speaking a person should not use cell phone for more than 18 to 24 minutes per day	test
audio_0_119609.wav	In service businesses, in most service businesses this is a primary strategy	test
audio_0_165297.wav	But, you hold a reference to that	test
audio_0_166420.wav	This member function is say called the printer	test
audio_0_128551.wav	So, vertical position you can move the signal horizontal	test
audio_0_28156.wav	so this is 0	test
audio_0_123645.wav	So, when you talk about operational amplifier like we have discussed earlier also, it is used to perform several operations right; it is used to perform summing there is summer, it can be used to perform integrator, it can be used to perform differentiator right it is also amplifier if you use proper feedback	test
audio_0_151369.wav	So, if f is an even function, then f x can be expressed in terms of just the cosine functions	test
audio_0_162622.wav	We had seen this during the presentation, during the discussion on inheritance itself, I had talked about output streaming operator and showed how passing a derive class object to a base class parameter would still work through the process of casting	test
audio_0_109633.wav	So, that's what we will look at today	test
audio_0_123386.wav	So, from here we can write whatever the voltage we measured in this column, at non inverting terminal whatever voltage we have measured here in the in terminal which is inverting, then we can put this voltage in this particular equation which is your I B plus	test
audio_0_116426.wav	However, there are so, many different shapes, which have been reported in the literature	test
audio_0_229.wav	It is on the projected space	test
audio_0_118253.wav	So, in the last lecture on microwave mixers, we studied mixer fundamentals, we covered the basic mixer operation, we saw what is the symbol and circuit representation of a mixer	test
audio_0_15881.wav	So, this is the plot of your this thing it versus time and this is your qt versus time this is the plot	test
audio_0_170429.wav	You can see the correlation between the unweighted and the weighted frequencies if you use completely different sequences then you can see a difference between the score obtained with the weighted frequencies as well as the unweighted frequencies	test
audio_0_25918.wav	so now, as we have shown this, our just to repeat: this is R cross N, this is R cross T, this is um T cross N, consisting of the N pilot vectors, and this is basically your R cross N matrix	test
audio_0_142437.wav	that means this is one upon that, actually right to differ, minus one bracket, close the to the power, half right	test
audio_0_118638.wav	And this can be achieved when we give dc voltage of about 50 kilovolt at about 10 gigahertz	test
audio_0_142212.wav	so if you do so, then magnitude of i r, that current magnitude, you will get four hundred seventy seven point five, six ampere	test
audio_0_25589.wav	if you remember, VK is 0 mean, symmetric, symmetric, complex Gaussian noise with variance Sigma square equals 3 DB	test
audio_0_101892.wav	Similarly, from here for the existing filament to grow I can have another situation where a filament branches like this	test
audio_0_13492.wav	So, here angle theta 1 plus theta 2 is equal to e to the power j theta 1 plus theta 2, right	test
audio_0_119409.wav	So, customers provide input, even at the idea stage	test
audio_0_128425.wav	Right now, let us see, that if you want to connect this person function generator to the digital oscilloscope how it will operate, aall right, and then we will compare both the oscilloscopes	test
audio_0_3169.wav	So, this is actually your this is actually your R 1 this is actually your if it is R 1 I think this is R 2 and this is R 3 yeah this is R 3 ; so, right	test
audio_0_19782.wav	Now it was given that raw material required of A and B is 12 and 10 respectively for one unit of finished goods	test
audio_0_166002.wav	We have introduced that in module 6 and discussed the two basic concepts of cv qualifier, constant and volatiles qualifier and the use of inline functions	test
audio_0_160526.wav	and the third constraint will be x one, three plus x two, three plus x three, three is greater than or equal to forty	test
audio_0_164438.wav	With that same header stack dot h	test
audio_0_160177.wav	so we realize that this feasible region, there is no actual region which satisfies both this constraint	test
audio_0_116350.wav	So, there will not be any wave propagation n TE 0 mode so forTE propagation non propagating mode is TE 0	test
audio_0_127548.wav	1 andd we have we are applying the input to the high pass filter	test
audio_0_129841.wav	If a thickness is higher then I have to spin coat at lower rpm, and if the thickness is lower, then I can spin coat at higher rpm	test
audio_0_164736.wav	Whereas, when you try to do invoke function g then again you come here and you have a virtual function so that gets dispatch to certainly C colon colon g because you have C object	test
audio_0_104717.wav	So, basically paxillin knockout mice is embryo lethal	test
audio_0_27243.wav	That we have shown is basically given by X transpose, X, inverse X transpose Y bar, where X is basically the pilot matrix	test
audio_0_164482.wav	So this becomes the partial instantiation of the template	test
audio_0_2678.wav	So, we go to the Excel function	test
audio_0_117600.wav	Here you can see that the operating point is chosen here which is slightly towards the active region this is approximately 5 to 10 percent of the maximum value of the collector current	test
audio_0_117121.wav	So, you can see that this impedance is same as this	test
audio_0_101583.wav	So, if this is the tail domain head and tail domain is connected by this constructor tension sensor which has an elastic linker in between	test
audio_0_121867.wav	So, as it says it to no one picture is what 1000 words, so this kind of mapping if therefore, very good for visual clarity and consensus of views across the organization and it often helps actually to portray to the customer, where you are	test
audio_0_142341.wav	but we will discuss on tap changing transformer regulators or boosters, shunt capacitors and series capacitors	test
audio_0_159061.wav	we are also going to make an assumption that, because of this increase of delta, we will still continue to make both the products, which means x one and x two that were in the solution	test
audio_0_164396.wav	So, this gives you the clear picture in terms of how the layout of the objects will be managed	test
audio_0_171145.wav	And do the alignment; alignment corrections	test
audio_0_121040.wav	There are two sides of the triangle, where on one side you see internal marketing on the other side you see external marketing	test
audio_0_148215.wav	coaching would get link to the ability to manage other people	test
audio_0_104368.wav	So, connection mediated via single protein is energetically unfavorable	test
audio_0_142446.wav	the line is supplying hundred five m v a zero point eight power factor lagging load through a step down transformer of two twenty by thirteen point eight k v	test
audio_0_101674.wav	So, this gets passed and then this is your light coming, this object is called the photomask	test
audio_0_13883.wav	So, an if you look into that if you look into that v 0 is equal to 24 volt that is plus; that means, if you look into that once again that current actually flowing in this direction	test
audio_0_26791.wav	arranged between them are basically the information subcarriers, that is, X 0 and X 2, and these are basically meshed, arranged like a meshed	test
audio_0_160126.wav	now this is the solution: x one equal to five	test
audio_0_2570.wav	We will try to understand all the engineering system by a I mean by sot of taking specific example cases where we can find out which are those which are controlled you know which are those factors we can be control easily by the use of the operator and which are the factors the really which are in the ambit of the product designer as such	test
audio_0_13980.wav	And by ohms' law, by ohms law this current is a your clock clock wise we are taking this current actually i 1, it is entering into the positive terminal	test
audio_0_167237.wav	So, in this access code if you look at little carefully, then you will see in the first part of the code we saw that I data the integer we assigned to and then we access i data, so 2 is printed	test
audio_0_26104.wav	this mechanism, or this step in OFDM transmission, is known as a Cyclic Prefix, the addition of the cyclic prefix	test
audio_0_138651.wav	that is also z m	test
audio_0_151478.wav	And so, the same function here in this region e power x and now it is represented by the pure cosine terms but it is also converging to the same exponential function	test
audio_0_118035.wav	You draw a real line and you draw vertical line which is a imaginary axis	test
audio_0_12468.wav	So, it is minus 2 i 2 right is equal is equal to V Thevenin is equal to they have writing here for you say	test
audio_0_159203.wav	the optimum has been reached here	test
audio_0_120766.wav	So, the product like an I phone cannot be the successful without the service of hi tunes	test
audio_0_12738.wav	And for long time, that means ah capacitor will act as your, what you call an open circuit; at that time what is the value, that is the V infinity right	test
audio_0_107449.wav	We will examine the wall	test
audio_0_125396.wav	If I keep on increasing, you see	test
audio_0_125934.wav	So, let us now see if we want to design, active high pass we continue where we have left in the last module, and that was high pass filter using passive components	test
audio_0_120530.wav	So, the whole idea is to have a customer continuously utilizing your services year after year and that is when this CLV becomes a meaningful term a CRM	test
audio_0_14392.wav	So, now V is equal to your 4 i because ah 4 ohm resistance is there, so across 4 ohm resistance the voltage is V is equal to 4 i	test
audio_0_143119.wav	so we will see that all the basic thing, that how we can go for optimal ah a system, ah, operation and economic ah your what you call load dispatch, so in this way, right, so what we will do it that ah, basically your what you call that a optimum system operation, ah, this thing, optimum system operation case, basically, you know, when you have that thermal power point is there, nuclear power point is also there, and sometime that hydrothermal coordination problem is another optimum operating problem area, right, that means ah, you have to, ah, your what you call this hydrothermal system also, as far as this course is concerned, hydrothermal coordination also we are not considering with, because ah, this also goes to the pg level, post graduation level, right	test
audio_0_129673.wav	So, the point is here I have a material which can be melted at 500 degree centigrade and beyond 500 degree centigrade you will get evaporation right	test
audio_0_107837.wav	And if you see the two pictures here at the bottom, you see that there is one wall separating off from the other and having a tendency to overturn in the out of plane direction	test
audio_0_15621.wav	So, 2 current are entering into the node that is i 1 plus your 12 is equal to 2 currents are leaving that is your i 2 plus your i x right ah	test
audio_0_149407.wav	these are some of the basic questions because ultimately this is going to effect the companys' performance	test
audio_0_168223.wav	Similarly, for a if it is friend, then it will look something like this only difference being the friend keyword coming in	test
audio_0_118777.wav	And just repeat the same options that I told you in the last class, select the appropriate component	test
audio_0_172008.wav	Similar arguments are grouped under single folder, for the base base to a algorithms are displayed in base folder and, tree based algorithms are displayed in trees folder and, decision rules based algorithms are displayed in rules folder	test
audio_0_160658.wav	there is only one position, which is this position with cost equal to eight, where the supply is thirty, the demand is thirty, and we put all thirty here	test
audio_0_164441.wav	Since expressions here are of integers so I need a stack which will keep the expression values which of integer, so this is instantiated with int	test
audio_0_106331.wav	However, lateral resistance is something that is given adequate coverage as far as how you can achieve a minimum amount of lateral resistance in the structure	test
audio_0_120796.wav	So, this is what we mean by emergence of linear partner relationships, from linear partner relationships to emergence of service ecosystem	test
audio_0_13396.wav	So, this one we can write in phasor notation say v arrow ok	test
audio_0_108964.wav	So you continue reducing alpha until TI is f s into ASI and at this point, at this point when the first one reaches TI f s into ASI, you reach the balance section	test
audio_0_112652.wav	So, let us go to the next part how to design microwave amplifier using transistor	test
audio_0_130293.wav	We can take any value; let us say 10 kilo ohms	test
audio_0_11317.wav	So, the complex power per phase will be P p plus jQ p is equal to V p I p conjugate	test
audio_0_126526.wav	When I do that what I will get	test
audio_0_106557.wav	There are timber rafters and these timber rafters are the main supporting system of the brick floor	test
audio_0_113044.wav	And then the last two digits basically correspond to the width of this particular chip component	test
audio_0_120867.wav	As the world has become one market and the non tariff barriers or even tariff barriers have continuously come down, competition in every market place has intensified and as a result there is a continuous pressure on prices, continuous pressure on customers expectation and as a result the organizations are under relentless pressure to reduce their costs	test
audio_0_139326.wav	first you have to understand this diagram	test
audio_0_164470.wav	Next we show something, this is just for your understanding of completeness, I will not get much in depth	test
audio_0_12734.wav	So, in this case tau is equal to I told you 8 second	test
audio_0_115520.wav	So, let us take a case when the distance between the 2 elements is equal to lambda by 2	test
audio_0_171831.wav	So, if you want to have a group of proteins, you can get the group with different aspects	test
audio_0_136623.wav	so zero, zero, but load is a one thirty eight point six and megawatt and forty five point two megawatt	test
audio_0_2533.wav	So, we can say that this a depth stop providing automatic spraying of the wax ok	test
audio_0_105065.wav	What this means is	test
audio_0_150502.wav	So, all these points x0, x1, x2 et cetera and also, we have taken one more point x these all belongs to domain of the function	test
audio_0_166765.wav	It is not going to make a difference, but later on we will show examples where it does really matter as to whether you have a proper object	test
audio_0_151094.wav	So, dr over dt is just the vector b	test
audio_0_14114.wav	So, we have to current find out the current through this 50 ohm resistance	test
audio_0_120980.wav	These researchers through this terminology highlighted the fact; that in service business to succeed, we must look at the business as a system, integrated system	test
audio_0_133528.wav	So, the first question that needs to be asked is how does this attacker manage to put this code on to the stack	test
audio_0_167592.wav	So, class B could write a conversion operator which you write as operator and the target type	test
audio_0_140414.wav	so but l one is equal to one	test
audio_0_17612.wav	Number of units is non known to you but you know the you can calculate the PV ratio because contribution upon sales is PVR	test
audio_0_149881.wav	So, this another singularity is classified as a simple pole and similarly we can talk about the z equal to i	test
audio_0_131169.wav	Now whenever, if any of these two buffers overflow, that is buffer 1 or buffer 2 overflows and it crosses the canary, then the canary value will be modified	test
audio_0_173008.wav	It is a mean of all this errors should be less right this is how it works in the case of the absolute values	test
audio_0_133967.wav	So, we call this a particular confined module how would we ensure that a function over here cannot access of another function or data outside this particular module, second how would be restrict reading and writing of data outside this particular module	test
audio_0_105528.wav	You start taking off sections, you will have to make amends for the cracked uncracked situation and then once the control comes from the steel permissible stress as well	test
audio_0_105987.wav	It's going to be difficult to estimate from a design perspective how much is the shear, I mean is the compressive stress in AG, in G H, in J K and in K B	test
audio_0_16218.wav	So, if you solve the Thevenin equivalent this circuit, if you solve this if you solve this circuit right you solve it because now you know how to solve it right	test
audio_0_163586.wav	That is what is, but in this case I was allowed to do so, here I am not allowed to do so	test
audio_0_125377.wav	You should not place a component over each other, right	test
audio_0_20880.wav	And also, would like to plan a very briefly into the history, paying out homage to several great minds who have contributed to the development of this particular field	test
audio_0_114557.wav	So, we can see that from here if I look at the input impedance, so this is 50 ohm and that impedance in parallel with	test
audio_0_159036.wav	we can understand a lot more things by keeping the same example	test
audio_0_163638.wav	So, let us move on and see what other things can happen with the public data	test
audio_0_11606.wav	So, all this write up is here	test
audio_0_128479.wav	cCan you change the horizontal position please,	test
audio_0_158450.wav	so it may not be possible to have this least cost allocation in every row or every column	test
audio_0_118992.wav	And lastly, a very important point that traditionally we looked at service after the goods were manufactured designed and manufactured and sold service was thought off	test
audio_0_104287.wav	So, fibrosis is lot of deposition of collagen	test
audio_0_111621.wav	So, there is neither attenuation nor propagation of the wave	test
audio_0_142543.wav	in that case it was y by two and y by two if this is your sending end and this is your receiving end, right	test
audio_0_220.wav	And as it so this shows that the principal component, direction of the principal component is not really providing you the good separations between data points	test
audio_0_21379.wav	That means, to break apart even a single nucleon from that nucleus, we have to supply even higher amount of energy and this way the binding energy per nucleon value has been measured by scientist for different kinds of nucleus and we get this particular graph which is very common, you will get this one in any text books, more or less the similar version of this one and also you can get this one over internet, where we have the mass number on the horizontal axis and the binding energy per nucleon on a vertical axis	test
audio_0_102816.wav	So, you have these fourth forces, force peaks which are comparable to folding signature of B reported in literature	test
audio_0_159211.wav	and if we do another simplex iteration we realize that there is no increase in the objective function because it is an alternate optimum	test
audio_0_136442.wav	so basically, this is for cooperative assistance, right, interconnected operation is always economical and reliable right, more we will see later, right, when we will come to the different topic	test
audio_0_828.wav	So first camera is considered as a reference camera of the studio setup and similar and second epipole sometimes it is also referred as right epipole that is on the second epipo the corresponding epipole on the second camera so these are certain notations also or terminologies will be used in our discussion you can also interpret epipoles as a vanishing point of camera motion direction	test
audio_0_128217.wav	Whatever the pattern is there, through that the ink will come down and it will stick on the substrate	test
audio_0_122290.wav	Similarly, if you look at intangible actions, intangible action services directed at the mind of people that is like for example, this session that we are having, it is an intangible action, there is no physical exchange, there is no touch and feel, there is no hand shake, but yet we have a mind shake here	test
audio_0_20530.wav	Let us write this as dk dT is equal to alpha T into k square	test
audio_0_125863.wav	We have frequency; we have gain; can we design this	test
audio_0_12320.wav	Now, output is equal to 15 KVA at unity power factor	test
audio_0_159135.wav	in the next iteration we will get a positive value here, which is a propose of having a negative pivot in a dual simplex iteration	test
audio_0_4697.wav	So, youryour this is RLR L over L that is one inductive branch and this is one capacitive branch right	test
audio_0_125038.wav	We have cap the frequency as it is, and we have we are trying to change the input voltage, we are trying to change the input voltage	test
audio_0_158810.wav	u one plus v one is equal to c i j, which is eight	test
audio_0_130634.wav	Another, very interesting register that this 8085 has is PSW register pair	test
audio_0_17054.wav	04 I 0 you have calculated 0	test
audio_0_115858.wav	So, we have to see the phase response more from here to here, ok	test
audio_0_109629.wav	The connections become critical and if you take care of connections, wall to wall connections and wall to floor connections, then you can harness the in plain, the good in plain resistance that masonry walls have	test
audio_0_164330.wav	Let us move on and quickly talk on the constructor destructor	test
audio_0_139794.wav	those things for the meshing courses, not here, but that is called v connection	test
audio_0_161164.wav	since the new primal is maximization, the new dual will be minimization	test
audio_0_173627.wav	This random because stochastic, this is exhaustive because systematic	test
audio_0_113383.wav	So, most of the power will go through here and at omega equal to infinity, this particular thing will act as an open circuit because Z is equal to j omega L	test
audio_0_156415.wav	What is happening as I said in all the reflected waves are get added up at Port 2 dash, so there is a load match load connected at this Port 2 double dash where kind of the where the reflected powers are synced or wasted away	test
audio_0_115773.wav	And, what is the area of the array L x multiplied by L y, you can see that this is the familiar expression directivity is given by 4 pi a divided by lambda square	test
audio_0_28323.wav	Remember, we said we would like to design the equaliser based on the 3 symbols: y k plus 2, y k plus 1 y k	test
audio_0_11218.wav	So, Z is not a phasor quantity right, it is a complex quantity	test
audio_0_108617.wav	The other two categories, type B wall and type C wall, in type B wall you are designing as per the requirements of the national building code and ensuring that over and above the steel that you are already designing as per the requirements of the code, you have complied with the minimum requirements that are stated earlier	test
audio_0_166260.wav	So, a data member is a component of a class structure	test
audio_0_124187.wav	It is very difficult, so I will put it little bit close to my jacket	test
audio_0_110813.wav	Now, let us see different source gain circles	test
audio_0_109930.wav	The other important aspect is if you look at the way codes define design procedures, it is not at the state of stresses that we work	test
audio_0_151800.wav	So, this is the Laplace of the error function of square root t	test
audio_0_109366.wav	That's the basis of the design at the ultimate limit state and this is achieved by the use of partial safety factors	test
audio_0_10024.wav	I mean what is there this your X L minus omega square it is expanded right	test
audio_0_128722.wav	We have also seen that this is exactly the similar concept in the inverting amplifier	test
audio_0_157933.wav	The switch is being switched on and switch off is very much higher as compared to the time constant	test
audio_0_133021.wav	So, the contents of a program header would look something like this	test
audio_0_160515.wav	now, continuing, we have the second set of constraints which says sigma x: i j summed over i is greater than or equal to b j	test
audio_0_172845.wav	Then once we select the features, then we need to extract and as well as the choose; what are the important features	test
audio_0_117733.wav	So, even in the court and theatre people have started installing jammer	test
audio_0_111993.wav	Now characteristic impedance of a lossless line is given by square root L by C	test
audio_0_170678.wav	So, if you look about the X ray crystallography these one of the most prominent methods available in literature currently, we have the very sophisticated instruments right crystallographic instruments right	test
audio_0_129508.wav	So, right now what we understood is how we can grow silicon dioxide	test
audio_0_167987.wav	So, first is a Virtual Destructor	test
audio_0_29111.wav	you know, dealing with ah, these kind of problems with ip based technologies like ipv six, is a problem, and also the issue of having billions of devices consuming bandwidth	test
audio_0_127757.wav	We will see how the parallel connection can be done right, the name itself that it will stop a particular band of frequencies	test
audio_0_116601.wav	So, that is approximately 15 d B this is the gain plot versus frequency you can see that over this particular bandwidth gain is almost flat which is of the order of 9 dBi	test
audio_0_166312.wav	This static value becomes 15	test
audio_0_112360.wav	And give some extra dimension to waveguide port	test
audio_0_13995.wav	Or 24 i 3 plus 6 i 3 is equal to 30 or i 3 is equal to 1 ampere	test
audio_0_125143.wav	If you want to measure minus 15 volts, how you can measure this is plus 15 volts	test
audio_0_116968.wav	Now, this is plus half this is minus half the voltage you can say that at this particular point will be equal to 0 which is replaced by a short circuit	test
audio_0_110594.wav	We will choose the Chebyshev filter, we want a Band Pass filter	test
audio_0_145450.wav	example is there, say, for example: name all the objects	test
audio_0_104808.wav	So, you must have them slightly above the integrins	test
audio_0_168191.wav	Now, before we actually start the discussions on operator overloading, let me quickly summarize recap as to why we want operators to be overloaded	test
audio_0_132628.wav	Now the problem with this thing comes from a performance perspective	test
audio_0_171964.wav	And you classified additional training and test dataset and, from this training dataset we need to extract different features, as we discussed in the class like the amino acid composition, or different properties	test
audio_0_3337.wav	The circuit then reduces to figure 13 in which it is convenient to taken V Thevenin as the reference voltage	test
audio_0_154501.wav	Now this is a technique that is frequently used whilst designing low noise amplifiers	test
audio_0_153487.wav	And there is another problem in this component which is not defined at t is equal to 2, so, we cannot discuss the continuity at t is equal to 2 and also for the negative values of t	test
audio_0_167224.wav	So, you make sure that your basic assumption is as name union suggests that this is a union of all these fields, so at any point of time only of the components will exist only one of the components has to be assumed	test
audio_0_158851.wav	for this position three minus six minus four, two, therefore one	test
audio_0_708.wav	And since we would like to maximize the variances and we would be considering the maximum eigenvalue for the vector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue	test
audio_0_129658.wav	There is a provision for holding your substrates	test
audio_0_137199.wav	then delta q two, delta q three, up to delta qn, right	test
audio_0_107055.wav	So beyond that point, we're looking at a cracked cross section and you have now work on the compressed thickness of the wall, which is less than T after this point	test
audio_0_126083.wav	That is your slew rate, very easy to understand, isn't it	test
audio_0_29088.wav	in terms of latency lot of time being taken by a data packet for a round trip, and this is what i was explaining to you with the diagram that i showed at the outset	test
audio_0_120559.wav	But, yet very distinctly, these were considered different from goods, articles, objects and in those days, I mean right from Adam Smith today, services were considered to be a little inferior to goods	test
audio_0_124184.wav	I am talking about the wafer	test
audio_0_128313.wav	So, focus, first thing that we see is sine wave, can you please show where is sine wave	test
audio_0_126284.wav	So, under root of what 4, so 4 is there into k, k is Boltzmann constant into temperature in Kelvin into bandwidth into resistance right	test
audio_0_26393.wav	Norm X bar square denotes the total energy of the pilot signal and therefore the variance is decreasing with increasing energy of the pilot signal or the pilot vector	test
audio_0_120826.wav	But, all these relationships even though this looks a pretty fuzzy sort of setting service design and certain rules of the game are very important; otherwise the technical network will not operate properly	test
audio_0_18727.wav	Whereas in a flexible budget you are assuming a dynamic scenario where the assumptions are likely to change, markets are likely to substantially change the level of activity is likely to change accordingly the budget is so designed that you can have a budget for various levels okay so fixed budget it is designed to unchanged	test
audio_0_16929.wav	So, i 0 t that is your if you come to the original circuit, this is the i 0 t right	test
audio_0_156122.wav	So that you know there is proper balance between the individual circuits	test
audio_0_11105.wav	This one also is equal to v upon I	test
audio_0_163529.wav	Now what will happen, if I add a and b enum as you know is the sub range of int, so if I try to add one enum with another naturally there is no separate addition of operation for enum	test
audio_0_111909.wav	If you read one book or other book, you should be familiar with the concept symbol can be anything ok	test
audio_0_135411.wav	but you please compute, right, you please compute, using this, your, what you call, the value of your, that lambda three	test
audio_0_102360.wav	So, you are G actin monomers, come together to form a filament	test
audio_0_250.wav	So the vector x minus m1 into x minus m1 transpose and sum of if I consider there are ieth samples so this is a ieth component and if there are n1 samples in s 1 so you have x i minus m1 into x i minus a 1 transpose the sum of them	test
audio_0_3386.wav	See another thing is the this is actually the this is just for the sake of compliment generating mode and slip is negative	test
audio_0_4557.wav	Frequency of induced your what you call your currents induced in the rotor is F2 is equal to sf this we have seen	test
audio_0_27629.wav	This is your covariance, which is basically equal to 33 over 260, minus over 260, minus 32 over 260 and 33 over 260	test
audio_0_13136.wav	So, the unit ramp function unit is 0, for negative values of t and has a unit slope for the positive values of t	test
audio_0_124177.wav	All these are substrates	test
audio_0_114229.wav	And in these type of tubes electrons are injected from the cathode and they will get potential energy from the DC beam voltage	test
audio_0_134165.wav	The next thing we actually look at is the address of user string	test
audio_0_130198.wav	So, this is the RC filter	test
audio_0_128934.wav	Can you see any positive negative sign	test
audio_0_157174.wav	So, miniaturization if it is required, power semiconductor devices are the solution, really	test
audio_0_133284.wav	py and store the result in this file call E2 and then we run vuln again and give the input using cat E2 and give the input from the file E2, so what we see now is due to this maliciously formed string, it would trigger the system to execute and create the shell as before is missing with the regular buffer, this shell is what is present over here with the PID 4416	test
audio_0_170086.wav	So I know that it is manager type therefore I cast it to the manager type	test
audio_0_160475.wav	a network is shown here which has some nodes or vertices which are connected by arcs	test
audio_0_14653.wav	So, they have all the filaments tungsten filaments say so, a question to what is the diameter on this, your this tungsten filament because if you see then you will find it is look like a coin right and what is that your diameter of this tungsten filament this is a question to you	test
audio_0_125691.wav	So, we have to find out whether the statement is true or false	test
audio_0_135197.wav	but you know this magnitude v two is given one and x e q	test
audio_0_132795.wav	So what we see is that for wrong key guesses we have a correlation which is quite small which is less than 0	test
audio_0_164539.wav	So, the objective is to look in to the implementation and use of sorting and searching in C and contrast them with C++	test
audio_0_141994.wav	so transposition is usually carried out at switching stations when that means its substation, right	test
audio_0_114618.wav	So that means, this is not really a very good combiner it is a good power divider but not a good power combiner	test
audio_0_4260.wav	Therefore, your V1 / your V1 / your E1 / E2 = N1 / N2 so, = your V1 / V2 is equal N1 / N2	test
audio_0_133420.wav	Next thing to actually think of is how does the loader know where these locations are to be fixed, so that can be identified by a table present in the executable and we can use the command readelf minus R mylib so	test
audio_0_163521.wav	Now there is no matrix type, it is just an array, it is a two dimensional array	test
audio_0_120726.wav	So, we have here on one side, that who or what is the direct recipient of the service	test
audio_0_166057.wav	Similarly, in the next one if you look in here I have expression j plus k	test
audio_0_26119.wav	And at time K equal to two	test
audio_0_17517.wav	Let us try to put it in a proper format in Excel	test
audio_0_3182.wav	So, these another circuit that further network in figure 50 find Rab and I just one thing here one here one small error is there	test
audio_0_113770.wav	So, basically this defines the space factor, for a given array	test
audio_0_105548.wav	So with the steel stress known, you can then, so you know FS1, FS2, FS3, FS4, you can then estimate based on the areas of cross section of the steel bars what the compression resultants are as ASI into FSI for each bar	test
audio_0_21014.wav	A on the other hand is the mass number, which is the total number of nucleons	test
audio_0_106203.wav	And at this stage, you really will have to look at what the ratio FTP to FTN is	test
audio_0_163231.wav	So, the area function, we had this function, we had seen earlier	test
audio_0_132357.wav	As soon as the program starts it would be surprisingly for you to know that the size of the heap is initially 0, so essentially the program would start with absolutely no heap segment	test
audio_0_128280.wav	So, I hope I see you in the next class and we will keep our journey on and we learn more with every class	test
audio_0_101520.wav	I had briefly talked about one study which linked cell shaped or cell spreading area with apoptosis dictated by the extent of cell spreading	test
audio_0_139252.wav	subject to that generation, total generation i is equal to one to m pgi	test
audio_0_150373.wav	Well, so this can be simplified now, so 2 y plus x minus 1, one can first integrate this dy with respect to y as a result we are getting this and then we will see that this is actually getting 0 the integrant	test
audio_0_121276.wav	So, to answer these questions for an incumbent service, that what are the characteristics of the addressed market segments, what needs are special to those market segments, how are those needs being met today and how they can be served better, how those market segments can be served better	test
audio_0_163517.wav	It finds do I have an operator plus, where the left hand side is string type fName, right hand side is also string type which is lName and if it exists then it will simply call this function passing fName as s1 and lName as s2	test
audio_0_102643.wav	So, what you see is you are only seeing one data peak, why is that	test
audio_0_166892.wav	But, they are not exactly malloc and free because malloc only allocates memory, but new allocates memory and also calls the constructor, free only deallocates memory, but delete, calls the destructor and then deallocates memory	test
audio_0_172220.wav	And the second aspect is, when they reduce the word size then the efficiency decreases right	test
audio_0_165665.wav	What the copy constructor will have to do	test
audio_0_133877.wav	However homomorphic encryption is quite difficult to achieve in practice especially for this kind of uses and therefore we would require alternate options	test

audio_0_118375.wav	So, v IF which is the output voltage is equal to v LO plus v RF into p of t	test
audio_0_171151.wav	When you go with the protein stability right what is the protein stability means	test
audio_0_13841.wav	So, it is minus v 2 is equal to minus 6 i is equal to 0 , right; that means, if you solve the circuit actually 4 i minus minus plus 10 i actually 10 i is equal to 40 ; that means, i is equal to 4 ampere, right	test
audio_0_117865.wav	So, of course, what you are familiar with the simple microwave oven	test
audio_0_103947.wav	So, this line was almost a straight line which meant that the slope is constant	test
audio_0_2144.wav	So, so there are tricky ways by which you can design these patterns and when you detect the corresponding patterns in the camera you are also detecting detecting that particular pattern and you know that it is the image of this location so this location is already encoded there is a particular location or direction of the ray which is given by once again no two indices of the plane of projection if I say where the rays are discretized and using them you can apply you can apply triangulation to solve it so it provides a code word is associated with a calibrated light point and it does not require multiple projection over the object that is advantage	test
audio_0_2634.wav	So, that sort of information it gives; events, number of events	test
audio_0_24791.wav	So here are my post it notes for you	test
audio_0_13269.wav	Up is there will come to that, but just listen ah just listen that; suppose , you have you suppose you have some your what you call that O A, O A is that radius suppose O A, suppose this this is center of the circle O and this is a O A represent that your maximum value of a sinusoidal quantity	test
audio_0_114929.wav	I just want to mention here, even though we took example of Gunn diode, but similar negative resistance region or they are for impart diode, tunnel diode	test
audio_0_17800.wav	So first of all calculate the total variable cost of sales which is 25 6	test
audio_0_111698.wav	So, in coupler, we have 4 ports input port through port coupled port and isolated port	test
audio_0_10739.wav	So, is basically 2 into 5; that means, your 10 ampere	test
audio_0_121932.wav	If the customer didnít buy your service would have paid this, then obviously, you enjoy a very huge surplus	test
audio_0_100777.wav	So, in this case this is a matrix recruited by the cartilage cells and it binds all the cells together into this through this mat which is woven by the cells themselves	test
audio_0_154652.wav	In the impedance matching networks, we 1st had found out a relationship for, gamma in omega and then we had equated it to a prototype gamma in omega	test
audio_0_131200.wav	Similarly the other data on the stack including the return address and the frame pointer gets overwritten with 32’s	test
audio_0_110098.wav	This becomes an unrealistic, the elastic, linear elastic assumption becomes an unrealistic assumption both for situations of the brick unit failing first or crushing happening in the motor early on	test
audio_0_118579.wav	And these are supported by the filament leads	test
audio_0_102129.wav	One of the very first studies which was tried attempted to understand this question was done by Yu Li Wang	test
audio_0_146234.wav	and the critical thinker is the one who accepts the multiple points of view and and he or she sees the problem on different points of view and he procedures other type of thinking, you the general procedure, critical thinkers, huge as many procedures	test
audio_0_20736.wav	Whereas, chemical shims generally compensate for initially high activity of fuel, or for slow control, chemical shim can be used	test
audio_0_108352.wav	Of course in that case what matters as material strength is not FTN the bending strength, flexible bending strength normal to the bed joint but FTP the flexible tensile strength parallel to the bed joint	test
audio_0_127405.wav	So, you remember that when you must design a band reject filter or band stop filter you have to connect low pass and high pass in a parallel connection	test
audio_0_129069.wav	So, we have now seen if I quickly repeat, we have seen this DC components, we have seen PCB, which is this one, this one, then we have seen the soldering	test
audio_0_115834.wav	And I am going to just tell you beforehand, at microwave frequency generally we do not use resistor , but we use inductors	test
audio_0_126937.wav	iIf you have missed the earlier modules, go back and see earlier modules and see how what are the bBarkhausen criteria is and how the oscillators were designed	test
audio_0_18162.wav	In such scenario, since the raw material is lying idle, we may not consider the cost of raw material as relevant because anyway it is going wasted so there is no point is including it in the variable cost of manufacture	test
audio_0_24501.wav	This is when he actually starts studying	test
audio_0_171418.wav	So, is ATP binding packet and this allows to the site here we focus on these two sites	test
audio_0_3561.wav	The stationary part of a DC machine consists of main poles, designed to create the magnetic flux, commutating poles inter interposed between the main poles and your designed to your sparkles operation of the brushes at the commutator and a frame or yoke	test
audio_0_110159.wav	1 that comes in here and then the uniaxial strength of the individual materials, compression motor and unit and tensile strength of the unit	test
audio_0_165195.wav	So, b will keep the reference to the value that is returned	test
audio_0_744.wav	There are five data points as you see there all data points are in three dimensional space	test
audio_0_138233.wav	that means because of small disturbance disturbance, there is a continuous oscillation	test
audio_0_21348.wav	Here, the mass of the electron, that means, this mass is generally, extremely negligible compared to the mass of proton and neutron	test
audio_0_147389.wav	so one thing is very, very important: that you speaking in a group for to achieve certain objective or for a common purpose are to to achieve the goal	test
audio_0_118308.wav	So, we have R g, R d, R s, as the resistance is at all the three ports	test
audio_0_118940.wav	So, in the rush hours, you did not have to even take out the card from your pocket and present it to the machine, if it was in your pocket, it sensed that you have got in and it automatically debited the fare, when you went out	test
audio_0_102867.wav	So, neighbours neighbouring domains stabilize each other	test
audio_0_112679.wav	Now corresponding to this now let us see we have S 1 1 plot	test
audio_0_27503.wav	all right, So the estimate h hat 0 is equal to you can clearly see this is y 0 divided by x 0	test
audio_0_102020.wav	So, in that case you are in no way to track the dynamics, but let us say you do the following experiment in which you take unlabelled filaments	test
audio_0_108485.wav	You don't want high strength steels because higher the strength more is the demand that's going to go on to the masonry, the masonry part before the steel can yield and that can imply crushing failure before the steel yields	test
audio_0_117499.wav	It is a straight line, so one can draw a straight line using this when they want to see the characteristics in i C verses v CE	test
audio_0_127641.wav	Then we can connect the unity gain amplifier	test
audio_0_28295.wav	these are known as channel taps	test
audio_0_116430.wav	You can see that I have shown dotted line over here which actually represents effective length as L e, effective width as W e	test
audio_0_136476.wav	right there, load cuurve will be different, different ah, commercial will be different, right then, domestic will be different	test
audio_0_22949.wav	So my story starts here 40’s, 1940’s a young inventor by name Altshuller was imprisoned in this prison	test
audio_0_164540.wav	These are the topics that we are going to discuss	test
audio_0_125237.wav	Now this is constant, you see 15	test
audio_0_122529.wav	So, these different customers have different types of demands and different types of price sensitivity	test
audio_0_171765.wav	So, based on different techniques or different stability or different information right in the literature for example, for the structure to T4 lysozyme right there are various papers published on this aspect so, the listed of the primary citations for that particular paper	test
audio_0_156051.wav	So here we will take yet another concept that is frequently associated with Linear Circuits or amplifiers and mixers which is the Linearity, the measure of Linearity	test
audio_0_170196.wav	From the last couple of modules we have been discussing about inheritance in C++	test
audio_0_149217.wav	now you see that images can be treated as texts	test
audio_0_132495.wav	The error is it cannot access memory at address 0X41414141	test
audio_0_152473.wav	203125 that is the x5 after the fifth iteration	test
audio_0_102190.wav	So, they did some other experiments in which on a soft surface, they took fibroblasts and exerted shear force and showed that on soft surface also focal adhesion grew; whenever you exert force, there was a growth of focal adhesion even on a soft surface	test
audio_0_112046.wav	So, all you require as a precision CNC machine and you can do the fabrication all that design details are generally available, you can just do the Google search and you can get all these dimension	test
audio_0_111385.wav	So, all the system needs to do is to create a noise signal and translate it in the same frequency band as used by the downlink band of the base station	test
audio_0_24508.wav	Writing for practice/running notes	test
audio_0_101854.wav	So, these cells can not only will have more amount of DNA damage, but they lose the ability to restive themselves ok	test
audio_0_127929.wav	Now, let us see another component, this is a capacitor	test
audio_0_135748.wav	so whatever we have taken before, actually k one and k two	test
audio_0_148303.wav	and once you take care of your own emotions, the cognitions will be influenced accordingly	test
audio_0_171534.wav	And do the structure based sequence alignment in this case they do not align the sequence wise they get the similar structures they align together	test
audio_0_17177.wav	To calculate the profit, now sales minus variable cost you get contribution	test
audio_0_124784.wav	You now want to measure here, then what will I have	test
audio_0_113344.wav	So, in this particular case what we did	test
audio_0_116200.wav	Generally waveguides are made from high conductivity metals such has copper, aluminium, brass etcetera and these waveguides can be of any shape but in general the rectangular and circular waveguides are used	test
audio_0_100828.wav	With that I again get started with the paper we started discussing on adaptive force transmission	test
audio_0_112210.wav	For the transformation from low pass filter to band pass filter, we had used the expression that S was transformed to this particular expression	test
audio_0_132879.wav	At the implementation level techniques such as masking and threshold implementations have been used where randomization has been incorporated into the design so that where the randomness limits the amount of information that the attacker can gain from the power consumed by the device	test
audio_0_27325.wav	okay, And finally, of course, you take the small Vs, which are the time domain noise samples	test
audio_0_158790.wav	so if we try in this position, the third position: if we put a plus one in this position, the minus one will come here	test
audio_0_163019.wav	So, if the call is saying apply operator new on type int so, but the actual operator function expects a size t, size t is nothing but unsigned int	test
audio_0_171583.wav	Then what will happen if tetranucleotides	test
audio_0_162663.wav	Certainly, before discussing the restricted types of inheritance, we were not we did not have to discuss this, because if you look into just the first column, since the inheritance is the list restrictive inheritance is the provides the list encapsulation, therefore, the visibility of the data members or the member functions in a derived class is simply same as their visibility or visibility in the base class	test
audio_0_123802.wav	But anyway point is in general op amp works on dual power supply, the dual power supply is plus minus 9, plus minus 12, plus minus 15 plus, minus 22 two ok, these are the dual power supply	test
audio_0_163127.wav	And then, I will be able to call it	test
audio_0_1848.wav	So you can see you have to apply the bilinear interpolation techniques	test
audio_0_756.wav	So if I take the diagonal terms you can see the total variance is 84	test
audio_0_152769.wav	So with respect to y we have y cube by 3 and then we have z square and then y there with respect to y after this evaluation we can then evaluate with respect to z and finally we will arrive here, the answer which is 416 in this case	test
audio_0_137062.wav	so this expression of this type four, type three, looks like little bit of you know huge mathematics but you have to do it	test
audio_0_154058.wav	1st of all if we have a transmission line, then we can define what is known as normalised ABCD parameters	test
audio_0_101735.wav	So, that is how you can control cell shape, but what you have to optimize is to make sure that your coating of pluronic or peg is uniform if this does not work then your micro contractibility would not work	test
audio_0_169208.wav	Think about the layout of the object, the object has a data member i, so I have a data member i this was constructed with hundred	test
audio_0_167624.wav	So, that could give you really disastrous result, for example, t 2 could mean a bigger type	test
audio_0_142248.wav	so i c, i c is that one forty eight point one, three magnitude	test
audio_0_104091.wav	So, Talin is known to activate integrins	test
audio_0_11307.wav	So, it is system is constant	test
audio_0_16826.wav	But, for AC circuit ah, we will solve very little because, complex number will be involved, right	test
audio_0_27730.wav	Now, if you look at the ML estimate now, remember that we have said HR hat equals 1 over N	test
audio_0_119294.wav	But, this is stage where price per unit is going down, because of this competitive pressure many people coming in this is the normal feature	test
audio_0_158038.wav	So we are going to have essentially this as V In and this as V 0	test
audio_0_159381.wav	then it move to the solution five comma zero with the objective function fifty	test
audio_0_17165.wav	In our last two sessions, we were discussing about CVP or BEP analysis	test
audio_0_165795.wav	3 and if I invoke c 1 dot get re I will obviously, get 4	test
audio_0_126952.wav	We were adding it and divided by 2,	test
audio_0_152468.wav	So, our interval will become now 0	test
audio_0_116921.wav	So, one path comes from here which is 90 degree	test
audio_0_172217.wav	See did you see because of the reason, why because the highly redundant, there should be some stretches which are the same among different sequences	test
audio_0_102114.wav	What they found was focal adhesion signal was much more prominent for the stars, and accordingly the stress fiber signal was also much more potent	test
audio_0_132271.wav	So, you can actually try this out on your machines	test
audio_0_144399.wav	we cannot avoid	test
audio_0_114188.wav	Now, let us move onto the next limitation which is transit time effect what is a transit time that transit time of an electron is the time taken by an electron to travel from cathode to anode	test
audio_0_119863.wav	So, if you do unable to do that, then there is a possibility that you will actually achieve a positive result out of a negative situation	test
audio_0_110828.wav	So, you can choose d for higher gain, but higher noise figure also	test
audio_0_141345.wav	divide, dividing equation this twenty six by divide equation by v s b	test
audio_0_125070.wav	You use again there is a phase shift the output voltage now is from one volts, it is about 5 volts	test
audio_0_15769.wav	So, one is entering into this your; what you call plus terminal, another is leaving the plus terminal	test
audio_0_121682.wav	But, there are several still, which almost is intuitive art, deep understanding of the consumer psychology, deep understanding of the different occasions and situations in which service is short and delivered	test
audio_0_14670.wav	So, this is the your six basic, one is luminous intensity candela that is it call cd, another is the thermodynamic temperature Kelvin in sort in your symbol is K and is the length meter symbol is m, another is mass kilogram it is kg, another is time it is second, an electric current in ampere A this is the 6 standard international or your what you call SI units form which other can be other can be obtain	test
audio_0_120872.wav	That means, the lower expertise, lower knowledge intense services to the extent they could be taken out of the closer connection with the value stream migrated to lower cost areas	test
audio_0_108904.wav	So, that's where you begin	test
audio_0_148190.wav	that was the key ingredients in those talks which told as, where and how conversation works	test
audio_0_26790.wav	So what we have is basically we have pilot symbols on the few subcarriers, data symbols, sorry, information symbols on the few subcarriers, and these subcarriers are basically meshed, they arranged like a comb	test
audio_0_141414.wav	that z p e q will be a square z s e q	test
audio_0_131652.wav	Now this software attacks are mostly focused on the system software and therefore we will be looking at C and C++ programs, we have been understanding the bugs and the vulnerabilities present in these programs and how an exploit can be written to use these particular vulnerabilities	test
audio_0_102845.wav	So, let me also draw it for B, this is for B	test
audio_0_160222.wav	so maximize: four x one plus three x two, subject to x one plus two x two less than or equal to seven	test
audio_0_17016.wav	So, no need to explain further	test
audio_0_107227.wav	Masonry is extensively used in the form of arches and this could be brick masonry, it could be fired clay, it could be sunburned bricks simply because of the fact that you have good compressive strength, the structural typology of the arch ensures that the entire cross section is in compression and you use a material which is good in compression	test
audio_0_143280.wav	so now, in this case, suppose this is a medium long line and representation by a nominal pi representation right	test
audio_0_138654.wav	you have to determine the sequence impedances	test
audio_0_165548.wav	We have talked about exception matching	test
audio_0_137310.wav	m is the mnth root of the m	test
audio_0_3955.wav	So, generally you your what we call that a simple your what you call three phase generator, we call alternator have been drawn here right	test
audio_0_169390.wav	What it does	test
audio_0_161378.wav	so this is our assignment, this is our assignment and this goes because we have made the assignment	test
audio_0_157920.wav	Now after this you are going to have actually a diode connected like this and a capacitor connected in this particular direction and I am going to have a load connected here and we are going to have actually the inductance stored energy which is actually being released during off interval its voltage comes in series with the voltage that is input	test
audio_0_27335.wav	now we can see: this Lth FFT coefficient can be estimated as X at X hat L equals Y of L divided by H of L	test
audio_0_159137.wav	now to do the first row, we look at this element, which is four	test
audio_0_164510.wav	It has a virtual function that can add elements find the length	test
audio_0_125904.wav	So, if you see there are lot of probes, always a longer one is connected to the input, and the shorter one is connected to the probe	test
audio_0_111921.wav	So, if you take this spacing as lambda g by 4, what will happen shot will act as open circuit	test
audio_0_161620.wav	so out of the four job, three jobs are have been given in each to this people	test
audio_0_156847.wav	On a Smith Chart this would look like this	test
audio_0_13793.wav	So, if you add this right it will become Y is equal to g minus jb right this way g is called Conductance b is called Susceptance right	test
audio_0_102062.wav	So, what was observed and then once again, what I have done red corresponds to intensity increase in other words it signifies the polymerization event and green corresponds to a de polymerization event	test
audio_0_26757.wav	so capital H L is is basically given by the Lth subcarrier coefficient, is given by the Lth FFT point of the 0 pared channel taps	test
audio_0_20177.wav	You probably have seen this images also; this is the route map that was followed, that is they started from this transient location at Gunam; sorry Guam and from there this Enola gay travelled by this particular path on 6th August and the target was Hiroshima for this	test
audio_0_102892.wav	In the next class will continue from here, discuss little bit more about one more aspect about protein unfolding, and then we will go on to study focal adhesions	test
audio_0_150842.wav	Well, so we will come to another property which is the change of scale property	test
audio_0_161722.wav	so i just click that to soya that my first constraint is given by the position b six	test
audio_0_26411.wav	So, in starting this module, let us explore the properties, Let us explore the properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate	test
audio_0_134349.wav	So for example the first % d would print the value corresponding to a, the second % d would print the value corresponding to b and the third % d since nothing is specified here would print whatever is present in the stack in this particular location note that this bug cannot be easily detected by compilers	test
audio_0_155401.wav	If both these 2 conditions are not satisfied, then it is potentially unstable	test
audio_0_167693.wav	So, it is not in concurrence with the normal flow of the program that comes unexpectedly like the interrupt in a program and so on	test
audio_0_3383.wav	So, the normal operating point is located well below TBD that is the maximum torque the full load slip is usually 2 to 8 percent right	test
audio_0_104500.wav	So, on outside you have your epithelial cells these continuously divide, and as they move out from the basement layer the orientation of the nuclei go from vertical to horizontal, and eventually at the outside layer these cells are dying	test
audio_0_15667.wav	For example if you apply your your what you call directly I am writing that apply suppose this is node 2 suppose this is node 2 this is your node 2 right	test
audio_0_168374.wav	C has a number of literals which are basically fixed values of built in types depending on how you write a particular literal, the type of that literal is decided	test
audio_0_142542.wav	so, and this is bus i, bus k, this pi representation of a line between two	test
audio_0_23205.wav	It might be a very small point but you are getting the small point might be written anywhere, but to find out to retrieve that thing is again it is a hassle for the student itself	test
audio_0_138582.wav	so earlier you have seen that your v b c, v c a and v a b right for line to line voltage, right	test
audio_0_133936.wav	Due to the miss prediction that had occurred however what we observe is that there is some component of array2 that is present in the cache now we know note that this component depends on the value of array[x]and what we have seen is that we have given a sufficiently large value of array[x] so that it was actually causing a buffer overflow and appointing inside the secret in other words what has been loaded into the cache at this location is essentially a function off the secret location	test
audio_0_154264.wav	This is the absolute bandwidth, bandwidth upon resonant frequency is called the fractional bandwidth, in other words, one by epsilon S which is equal to QS is equal to 1 upon the Delta, Delta represent the fractional bandwidth	test
audio_0_104582.wav	So, how is this process happening	test
audio_0_10847.wav	So, it will be actually 192 watt right	test
audio_0_173036.wav	Likewise you can use this type of information right in the different classification problems right for example, if you take a simple model of a neuron, this is a kind of regression in 1d	test
audio_0_22053.wav	Okay, when to start with your story on what the project is about, oh excellent wait wait wait a minute, wait a minute, FLASHBACK	test
audio_0_167546.wav	And so on the size happens this and then you come back and do the special window specific stuff on the original object	test
audio_0_146383.wav	and the logic or the emotional dimension of it	test
audio_0_17998.wav	You will be surprised now the profit of Q is 311	test
audio_0_151389.wav	So how to do that, so this can be done by extending this f x to an even or an odd function	test
audio_0_12452.wav	Now, if you want to find out what is your your V oc is equal to V Thevenin is equal to V 1 2	test
audio_0_133705.wav	But rather, we are depending on small snippets of codes which we call gadgets and we are creating these the stack contents in such a way that these various gadgets execute and are able to give the same effect as having a sequence of the target payload instructions getting executed	test
audio_0_172300.wav	So, first what are the requirements of QSAR analysis, but the case of docking what are the requirements	test
audio_0_166913.wav	We have already discussed the inheritance mechanism in C++ at length; we have also discussed dynamic binding or polymorphism in the context of polymorphic hierarchies	test
audio_0_159189.wav	then we move to the next iteration	test
audio_0_148040.wav	ok, so networking skills: we need certain networking skills in order to be successful in a community	test
audio_0_12157.wav	Again you have to the your what you call again you have to switch off the supply and you have to reconnect the fuse wire right	test
audio_0_135345.wav	so this is the rotor angle would then oscillate back and forth between delta zero and delta two	test
audio_0_156276.wav	Here we are assuming that this oscillator can be divided into two parts; one which is strongly dependent, whose value is strongly dependent on amplitude and to a lesser extent on frequency	test
audio_0_146141.wav	so outlining is where you joint down the points	test
audio_0_129875.wav	As you see here the field is bright, here the field is bright everywhere the except around the pattern area and which is why it is a bright field mask	test
audio_0_162657.wav	So, public private will be private	test
audio_0_133361.wav	Now after a certain number of authentications have completed, for a given challenge the attacker could use the model for that PUF which it has actually created which it has actually built and respond to the challenge	test
audio_0_107481.wav	Of course you have other types and the list is not exhaustive, other types of masonry units, you could have stone masonry units, you could have sun dried, compressed, stabilized earth blocks	test
audio_0_114694.wav	Now let us say we are giving a input at this particular port here, so what happens from here to port 3 there are 2 paths are there there is a one path from here and there is a another path from here	test
audio_0_134094.wav	So these overhere is the machine code for this instruction call to function	test
audio_0_151993.wav	So, for instance, if we apply the definition we have e power minus s t del u over del x dt	test
audio_0_132780.wav	So, what happens over here is that this particular algorithm which we assume is implemented in a device takes three parameters x, c and n typically the c is going to be secret and it is what the attacker wants to obtain	test
audio_0_136785.wav	the minus sign indicates actually power is flowing from three to two	test
audio_0_121651.wav	And QFD, the lots of material are available on the web, excellent tutorials are available and the web, either at You Tube or through Google and I will request you to go through them and see, how you will actually apply	test
audio_0_2827.wav	Then where r actually your, what you call this r actually measure that from this actually it is a cylindrical shape right, it is a cylinder shape not shown in the diagram	test
audio_0_155471.wav	If it does not lie in the stable region, then you need to find another value of gamma S and repeat this process till the time that gamma L, was gamma S and gamma L are in the stable regions of the input and output stability circles respectively	test
audio_0_11188.wav	So, if you do, so if you multiply this R plus I into j X L minus X C, so this is actually this, but at the time same time if it is V C is given minus j	test
audio_0_19975.wav	For example, suppose a student of one board, a state board gives an exam for 700 total marks of 700	test
audio_0_1641.wav	So what we need to do you need to compute age orientation that means angle of the gradient minus 90 degree so that is how the age orientation is defined	test
audio_0_20583.wav	And as the concentration of isotopes like plutonium 240 keeps on increasing, it becomes a bit more negative	test
audio_0_118584.wav	And for each cavity there is a slot which connects the cavity to the RF interaction space	test
audio_0_121748.wav	Either, we want to initiate price cut or we want to initiate price increase	test
audio_0_26646.wav	So basically, you are considering a downlink scenario	test
audio_0_160097.wav	put together actually have the identity matrix	test
audio_0_10038.wav	Already we have done it for resonance	test
audio_0_161734.wav	now we go to options here and then we could put: there are several options that are there, so we will go back and say automatic scaling and we could, ah, keep it as it is	test
audio_0_123972.wav	Can I use a substrate which is silicon dioxide	test
audio_0_116119.wav	Now, I have given all thesesteps, but what I just want to tell you here conceptually that let us say we are giving a input power P 1 over here	test
audio_0_134738.wav	So, what FANCI actually measures, is the probability with which this input A affects the output	test
audio_0_139748.wav	this is equation one	test
audio_0_6.wav	Like in this representation, it is K into this is a rotation matrix which is involved a coordinate transformation from world coordinate to the camera centric coordinate by rotating the coordinate axis	test
audio_0_3759.wav	So, this is slight difference between loop and mesh, but loosely sometimes, we talk either loop or mesh, right, but this is the difference between the loop and mesh ok	test
audio_0_119678.wav	Hello, I am Jayanta Chatterjee from IIT Kanpur and we are discussing Managing Services and the Contemporary Issues	test
audio_0_155565.wav	Now it can be shown that on division the signal reaching port 2 from this amplifier and the signal reaching port 2 from this amplifier will add constructively at port 2, whereas the single reaching port 1 from the this amplifier and the signal reaching port 1 from this amplifier will add destructively at this point	test
audio_0_10880.wav	Now, and in this case for dependent voltage source this actually leaving the plus terminal so, p 2 will be negative power supplied and p 2 will be is equal to your, this is minus sign power supplied	test
audio_0_12810.wav	And v c infinity will be 10 into 20 by 40 is equal to 5 volt	test
audio_0_161295.wav	so we tick the corresponding column and we get this	test
audio_0_138158.wav	already we have defined, and this is your z p matrix, and this is you're a matrix	test
audio_0_100680.wav	So, it does not take into account the dynamics which is continuously going in the cells, as we observed in a movie that I had played in a cell transfected with Lifeact	test
audio_0_20843.wav	So, despite such a large numbers, actually nuclear energy is a quite small portion of the total energy produced in US	test
audio_0_1988.wav	Or if you want to use the nonlinear forms, then also there will be coefficients regarding the nonlinear terms and your model size will be increasing but as there would be more number of parameters	test
audio_0_126819.wav	wWhen we apply some pressure, it will start resonating	test
audio_0_113938.wav	So, you can actually think about six 30 minutes is about one tenth of what I have recorded through antennas course NPTEL	test
audio_0_149028.wav	there are thousand other examples and there must be at least fifty to sixty different cognitive biases if you search them up in the wikipedia, and these are of various kinds and these are all about errors in our thi thought processes because of various kinds of flaws	test
audio_0_160561.wav	but if we look at this example that we are talking, we will have nine variables and six constraints and it would become difficult for us to solve it using the simplex table	test
audio_0_138616.wav	so this will remain open because no negative sequence current can flow	test
audio_0_111312.wav	So, you can see all the different components in the circuit are designed based on the requirement using several market available ICs and microstrip techniques which we have studied in this course	test
audio_0_171791.wav	So, you can see this is the average where 149 angles 129	test
audio_0_128272.wav	So, always remember to discuss with people understanding and sharing of ideas will improve your knowledge	test
audio_0_112541.wav	So, in s2p file they use the biasing circuits	test
audio_0_103333.wav	So, let me draw what is tension and what is compression so is already clear to you	test
audio_0_131716.wav	In the Load time relocatable the main functionality rests with the loader, where, when the library gets loaded, the loader would pass through the library and adjust each address properly, so that the library executes in the right expected manner	test
audio_0_112781.wav	It is a reflected wave divided by incident wave	test
audio_0_108953.wav	So, we are trying to check if C the compressive force resultant at each bar is non zero or I mean is it positive or negative	test
audio_0_168680.wav	So, you are invoking the push method for the stack object and so you are just saying what you pushing here	test
audio_0_761.wav	So we can represent this data only using these two components itself	test
audio_0_161846.wav	now the value of the objective function is minus m into four, plus minus m into ten, which is minus fourteen m	test
audio_0_11645.wav	Similarly, let me clear it similarly for current it is I angle beta that is I cos beta plus j sin beta that is your I cos beta plus j I sin beta right this is your I angle beta	test
audio_0_105439.wav	So this is a trick in the behavior of masonry and is something that is addressed in the next module you will see how the uniaxial strength of motor then finds its way into an estimate of the compressive strength of the masonry with necessary modifications to account for the confinement effect or the state of triaxial compression	test
audio_0_152950.wav	Well, if we integrate now with respect to s this relation here F s is equal to minus d over ds Laplace of g t then we will get so this side first	test
audio_0_164070.wav	Then we get plus the next operator	test
audio_0_105709.wav	Now, this code is important for us because we do not have a specific code on reinforced masonry, right	test
audio_0_104708.wav	And this recruitment of vinculin binding to talin reinforces focal adhesions	test
audio_0_28715.wav	this is in the FFT domain, so let us say this is the output sample, output sample across the Lth FFT point	test
audio_0_10546.wav	Evaluating the derivative of v t in equation 12 at t is equal to 0	test
audio_0_141836.wav	so you have to find out the power factor of the sending, your sending end	test
audio_0_169248.wav	Here we have only one entry because we have only one virtual function	test
audio_0_114007.wav	So, let us see the derivation we will start with one of the equation and we will get the second equation from that	test
audio_0_107194.wav	So, for fairly low aspect ratios, the shear deformation is what will govern for both the cantilevered profile and the fixed pure cases and that's really because of the way the expressions pan out in terms of what is on the denominator	test
audio_0_103060.wav	This you can directly find out the unfolded length, now because you know the number of residues because you know the number of residues	test
audio_0_112390.wav	And we will see in what manner this particular antenna is behaving	test
audio_0_156127.wav	Then yet another method of achieving this linearity is what is known as Feed Forward Linearisation	test
audio_0_126539.wav	So, after developing photoresist I will have patterns like this	test
audio_0_135440.wav	i mean, if you know delta two, delta three, delta n from the load flow studies right, everything is known then this one can be also computed right	test
audio_0_155580.wav	So, in summary, a coupler is a very widely used microwave device, it is a very useful device	test
audio_0_16822.wav	And once DC part will be over, we will go for your what you call single phase AC circuit	test
audio_0_152774.wav	So we have to project the given surface in one of the coordinate planes and that depends on so, that this grad f dot p, the grad f dot p should not be 0	test
audio_0_166625.wav	So, name space is like when we use in our own names, it is like a family name or the last name that we use	test
audio_0_11337.wav	So, there is that is why for a star connected load that is why this one it can be written as your I L is equal to I p and V L is equal to that means, it is actually it is 3 V p I p cos theta, this can be written as root 3, then in bracket you write your root 3 your what you call V p right into I p then cos theta	test
audio_0_114262.wav	This assumption is made, so that the velocity of electrons is modulated only in this cavity gap	test
audio_0_24819.wav	What Sam does before that activity takes place, during that activity takes place and after that activity	test
audio_0_139551.wav	line to ground fault, solid line to ground, fault has occurred	test
audio_0_121574.wav	So, this each customer contact is actually an input into our service quality evaluation model and obviously, there are more opportunities to dissatisfy the opportunities to satisfy that is kind of a natural paradigm	test
audio_0_118273.wav	We present the LO signal, this time varying LO signal which has quite large amplitude or a higher signal level	test
audio_0_25912.wav	this is basically: each vector is T dimensional, I have N such vectors, so this is a T cross N matrix	test
audio_0_125190.wav	we will see, b But that does not mean that voltage and current have linear relationship	test
audio_0_104703.wav	So, this is one of the first proteins to get recruited to focal adhesions	test
audio_0_101707.wav	So, using PDMS people have optimized the composition of the PDMS that the use and like this you can use this very well you can use this for getting micro pillars	test
audio_0_157218.wav	And what is the kind of size limitations you have and so on and so forth	test
audio_0_164415.wav	The depth first traversal of a three would need a stack of node pointer types of the three nodes	test
audio_0_29014.wav	so cloud is very important because you see that internet of things iot devices, sensors, r, f, i, d devices and so many different types of devices this sends so much of data and finally, those data have to be handled and that is the reason that a cloud came into picture, that all these data will be sent to the cloud for further processing, and so on and so forth	test
audio_0_172377.wav	So, this go we get that IC 50 values	test
audio_0_104473.wav	In both these cases the gels are coated with collagen one which this is a one ECM protein which is recognized by the cells	test
audio_0_2271.wav	So, you have a scope for quality aspects or quality you know auditing or quality data acquisition at the system level itself, which imposes these costs ok	test
audio_0_151144.wav	So, in either way, this is useful to find the maximum value of the function or minimum value of the function	test
audio_0_127800.wav	So, what is a point you again lLet us look at this point again, the transformation of the filter characteristics can be easily implemented using a single low pass and high pass filter circuit; single low pass and high pass filters, , followed by followed by right, this is you see low pass filter is here high pass filter is here, followed by what is this unity gain amplifier, unity gain amplifier	test
audio_0_143352.wav	so c one plus c two is equal to v r	test
audio_0_103229.wav	So, if I do this then an if I plot A bar at t equal to 0 A f t is same as A i	test
audio_0_102403.wav	What they showed that when you have confined migration you can have lot of nuclear rupture events, how do they prove it	test
audio_0_151161.wav	Then we call that the function is an even function	test
audio_0_21303.wav	So, from that, we know that it is possible to have for any natural element to have different kinds of nucleus, where the atomic number remains the same; that is the total number of protons inside the nucleus is the same, but their mass number varies because they may be having different number of neutrons and as the atomic number that is the number of protons reside the chemical properties, so different isotopes of the same element, more or less have the same kind of chemical nature , but the nuclear properties depends strongly on the number of neutrons and the basically on the mass number	test
audio_0_137225.wav	so minus of minus point five	test
audio_0_2597.wav	For example, let us go back to the case of the steering wheel and the customer who is the driver of the car	test
audio_0_164166.wav	What you see here is, this particular function prod and this is implementation I am not going through the implementation you can check it at a later point of time this is a typical matrix vector multiplication cout	test
audio_0_22677.wav	So if you are to look for such a repository, you know what to take and see, compare whether they have all that	test
audio_0_140383.wav	actually, right so equation twenty four depends on the load flow solutions	test
audio_0_125658.wav	Here, I D versus V D S while transfer characteristics would be id versus V G S for fixed V D S; for fixed V D So, let us draw the transfer characteristics	test
audio_0_153956.wav	Now you might have asked me why restrict ourselves to this path, there can be other paths also and absolutely	test
audio_0_162559.wav	In the next module, we will take up the other cast operators and move on	test
audio_0_165099.wav	So, I am trying to do s 2 assign s 1	test
audio_0_24379.wav	I am going to show you on the screen is called Eggomobile	test
audio_0_171262.wav	So, here you can get the delta sigma i parameters	test
audio_0_150222.wav	So, now when this exactly equality will happen, because otherwise there will be a problem with the minus sign	test
audio_0_11484.wav	So, I c is equal to V CN by Z C	test
audio_0_120393.wav	Now, we have three major P’s left, namely Place, Price and today we are going to discuss about this P called Place	test
audio_0_165878.wav	But if the binding depends not only on the type of p, but on the actual object that the p is pointing to	test
audio_0_169353.wav	See what is the result is the third line is p A, which is address of A	test
audio_0_11312.wav	So, this is one important reason for using three phase system to generate and distribute power because of your, this is power what you call independent of the time	test
audio_0_158125.wav	Now the output of this transformer is going to be rectified in all probability with the help of a simple diode bridge rectifier	test
audio_0_165733.wav	Why certainly is questionable	test
audio_0_105692.wav	We are now into the next module	test
audio_0_165761.wav	So, it will give me the same effect, but I will not be able to write this chain assignment	test
audio_0_1892.wav	The top it is showing the surface plot of error for the u component and the bottom it is showing the surface plot of error of the v component	test
audio_0_128060.wav	On the fourth chip on the screen, the bottom right is 8 pin dual inline package and again you see what is that	test
audio_0_169937.wav	Let us first try to understand issue what are we trying to do, there are two complex objects and I want to write this, this is the basic thing, I want to use this and be able to write them	test
audio_0_159674.wav	so if, if, for some reason, these two were positive, then this minus seven minus five, zero, zero will tell me that it is optimum	test
audio_0_105979.wav	So that's going to be taken care of by shear resistance available in the two sides of the arch itself	test
audio_0_140028.wav	distance, uh, because you have to calculate d b one, d b two, d a one, d a two, all the distances right	test
audio_0_133788.wav	Now as we know when this particular gadget is executing, we have the stack pointer present here	test
audio_0_160863.wav	and the value of the objective function is zero into three plus ten into six, which is sixty	test
audio_0_104250.wav	If you were to track beta 3 tubulin, which is a neuronal marker	test
audio_0_113830.wav	Now, let us go to the next configuration	test
audio_0_115775.wav	This is the principle of phased array antenna, that you change the phases between the different elements	test
audio_0_28663.wav	we are considering an N equal to 4 subcarrier system	test
audio_0_14221.wav	Now, question is that your first you have to find out what is I s c that this is a common terminal, this is a common terminal	test
audio_0_151728.wav	And this dt will be d tau and the limits so when this t was tau t was capital T then the tau will become 0 and when t is infinity in that case tau will be also infinity	test
audio_0_109239.wav	So, to check whether a wall has started cracking, you will need an estimate of whether the combination of the lateral force and the gravity force can cause cracking and watch the eccentricity and then how much do you reduce the compressed length of the wall itself	test
audio_0_127334.wav	So, what we see is that we are going to see from the output voltage expression that one way to decrease output voltage is by minimizing the feedback resistance R 2, but decreasing the feedback resistance the required gain cannot be achieved, but decreasing resistance the feedback resistance the required gain cannot be achieved, right	test
audio_0_153940.wav	So, we already saw that when we have an inductor in series or shunt, we can shift our impedance or admittance and they will be shifted upwards in a ZY Smith chart when we have a capacitor in series or shunt, the impedance or admittance will be shifted downwards in the ZY Smith chart	test
audio_0_108825.wav	So, here in the previous expression we would have put L into T here but I am replacing that with AW which is the area of cross section of the wall	test
audio_0_114335.wav	Hello today I will be taking a session on simulation software that is CST microwave studio, where CST stands for Computer Simulation Technology	test
audio_0_129730.wav	However, this is very simple to use it because we have to just lower the substrate and apply the power and boat will get heated up, when boat will get heated up, this of the material within the boat gets heated up, the material starts melting then it starts evaporating it will get deposited super simple to operate right; however, there are some of the drawbacks	test
audio_0_131605.wav	So, let us for example, say that we have programmer who is writing a program to say sort hundred numbers present in an array, so he would use one of the standard sorts, like selection or bubble or quicksort and compile the program get an executable	test
audio_0_107502.wav	And of course, depending on the proportions of these impurities the color of brick also can vary but typically we are talking of calcium magnesium potassium as the impurities in the oxide forms the manufacturing processes there are different manufacturing processes but typically the processes differ in the clay content, the moisture content present in the clay itself	test
audio_0_115443.wav	Now, if you want to see s 21 all you need to do is move to next trace, ok	test
audio_0_122741.wav	To understand this process therefore, we have to understand the touch points, we have to understand all the background processes and understand this entire thing as a system to create a good successful service instance	test
audio_0_101347.wav	So, this is the long axis of the duct	test
audio_0_24036.wav	Not in a very safe setup in and which does not represent what your customer is, so that is the whole point of this long story	test
audio_0_18437.wav	So it keeps on falling as the number of units increase	test
audio_0_108535.wav	So, you can actually minimize the bed joint thickness if you are going with flat truss type or flat lattice type bed joint reinforcement such that you don't increase the bed joint thickness because you know that higher the bed joint thickness lower is the strength of masonry such that you don't compromise with the strength of masonry you can use high strength motors in the in the joint and you come bring down this cover to almost two millimeters for bed joint reinforcement for corrosion resistance it is it is prescribed that you can go for stainless steel, but of course stainless steel would imply shooting up of prices, the cost of construction, at least galvanized hot tip galvanized or epoxy coated steel reinforcement has to be used to ensure there is protection against reinforcement	test
audio_0_139073.wav	delta p two zero, that is point five	test
audio_0_137994.wav	this is i b zero	test
audio_0_118952.wav	So, the point that we are discussing that cyber networks, information communication technology based networks are transforming service delivery, creating new services and opening the doors to many different types of innovations	test
audio_0_171611.wav	Now, in the 3D structure you can calculate the distance from the first one and the forth one	test
audio_0_150832.wav	So, Laplace inverse e power minus s s square plus 4 e power minus 2s s square plus 4	test
audio_0_134789.wav	So some of these things we have actually discussed as part of this lecture corresponding to integer overflow which we have seen in the previous videos and many of these modern malware would use such vulnerabilities in integer overflow or signedness of integer or the width of integer to subvert execution and create payloads, thank you	test
audio_0_149453.wav	So, this x we will replace by this xk then the right hand side we have minus D L plus U which is the iteration matrix G, for this Jacobi method and then this D inverse is like H there are in the general setting	test
audio_0_16017.wav	So, that is why I have written V is equal to 100 volts	test
audio_0_130305.wav	Given the values, you can design a circuit; and given a circuit, you can find out the values	test
audio_0_131011.wav	Note that, we are sending the buffer here and the size of this particular packet is 3 plus payload plus the padding	test
audio_0_116572.wav	This is the configuration where, parasitic patches are placed along the non radiating edges of the fed patch	test
audio_0_121766.wav	Hello, so we are in week 5 of Managing Services, Contemporary Issues, I will continue from where I left of yesterday	test
audio_0_114144.wav	The vacuum tubes such as triodes, tetrodes, pentodes etcetera, these are the examples of conventional tubes	test
audio_0_132113.wav	So, in this way what we have seen is that, we have seen how GDB can be used to actually change the execution pattern of this particular program	test
audio_0_113485.wav	So, if we are going to operate at fundamental mode TE 10	test
audio_0_144056.wav	exercise with others so that you can get the signal from others how others are performing and how well they are performing others	test
audio_0_20854.wav	I shall be coming back to this figure after a few slides	test
audio_0_147711.wav	it will mould my behavior, my character, the way i talk with others, my communication behavior as well	test
audio_0_27647.wav	We have said that the estimate is given, the maximum likelihood estimate is given by the sample mean, which is both unbiased and has a variance of Sigma square by N	test
audio_0_160140.wav	similarly, minus ten minus four is is also negative because m is large and positive	test
audio_0_158486.wav	the second row we are not going to look at it, therefore i have shown it using a dash	test
audio_0_14947.wav	So, your equation will be like this right	test
audio_0_151836.wav	Now for the change that means we want dt and then du there	test
audio_0_3977.wav	And here it is entering, it is leaving right	test
audio_0_163194.wav	So, naturally your candidates again are all three	test
audio_0_134680.wav	On the other hand, there will be slight differences in the power profile of the chip if a Trojan is present	test
audio_0_119073.wav	But, that is not mean as I mentioned yesterday also, a satisfied customer necessarily does not mean a repeat customer and necessarily does not mean a customer advocacy	test
audio_0_171743.wav	So, there are some databases which have this information right	test
audio_0_165924.wav	So, I again look into the static case; I have one member function here, which is specialized, which is overridden in the derived class function	test
audio_0_110263.wav	So with the two differential equations available we can now proceed to work towards a forced displacement relationship	test
audio_0_166226.wav	We are sure that the data itself may not be constant, but if I am holding a constant pointed to that data, then certainly that pointer will not allow me to change the data	test
audio_0_121642.wav	The capacity determination, information packages, equipment, these are the ways actually we achieve these factors	test
audio_0_12831.wav	And equivalent circuit is one whose v i characteristic are identical with the original circuit	test
audio_0_126035.wav	So, output voltage would be 0 volt when inputs are grounded, right is what we think	test
audio_0_159765.wav	the objective function values are different but based on these two alone, i can say that now both primal and dual will have optimum solutions	test
audio_0_170097.wav	But if you look into the actual application code here, then you see that earlier we had these two lines because we had only engineer and manager now you have a director	test
audio_0_25642.wav	Alright, so we have seen, and in fact we are considering, a complex baseband transmission model in which all the quantities are complex, that is, the transmitted pilot symbols, the received pilot outputs and the noise samples at the receiver, all the quantities and also, for, importantly, the channel coefficient H is a complex baseband channel coefficient	test
audio_0_136815.wav	this is infinite bus and input power is p, i or the generator	test
audio_0_169814.wav	And this is what will be very useful in writing functions particular with large number of parameters where a good set of parameters may often take a default value to work with	test
audio_0_13106.wav	Except this delta t minus t 0 is equal to 0 except at t 0 is equal to t 0	test
audio_0_131424.wav	If I change this to say 104, run the fine payload, store the length of E2 of 104 byte is in E2 and run it you see that it works so 104 is not going to solve our problem	test
audio_0_116168.wav	This is 50 plus 50 will be 100, 50 plus 50 will be 100, 100 in parallel with 100 will give me 50	test

audio_0_16158.wav	Next is your Norton theorem	test
audio_0_169422.wav	Now try to do typeid p, typeid p is it is static type which is A star because it is A type	test
audio_0_104171.wav	So, there is no constant behavior among these adhesions which are small in size and close localized close to the nucleus	test
audio_0_143972.wav	for example, people in business, those who have a reputation for excellence, quality and service, tend to continue in the same fashion to keep their reputation intact	test
audio_0_119273.wav	So; obviously, if you are competitive position is like this is on a scale of 100, so which means here you are very strong competitively and, so if you are competitively very strong and that market is very attractive and your competitively very strong	test
audio_0_157901.wav	When I have 5, 6 1, 5 belongs to C phase, 6 belongs to B phase, 1 belongs to A phase	test
audio_0_23174.wav	This is about trying at many many times and then you get a become you attain mastery with these methods	test
audio_0_134271.wav	So, we will start off with how Trusted Execution Environment is different from confinement or the topics that we have studied in the previous lectures	test
audio_0_166780.wav	So, with this we understand that this is what the lifetime is and this is where it starts and this is where it ends	test
audio_0_165700.wav	So, at this point what happens is the distractor of A is called	test
audio_0_126902.wav	right t The aging rates are 2 into 10 to the power minus 8 per year, per year for quartz crystal	test
audio_0_111660.wav	461 centimeter and the formula for cutoff frequency as we have discussed isfc is equal to c by 2 into under root m by a whole square plus n by b whole square for air filled waveguide	test
audio_0_110657.wav	So, add equation Plo equal to 0 and means at a sweep from 0 to 20 step of 4 for the LO power level	test
audio_0_148599.wav	berkeley has a centre for get the good and they have generated a lot of questions and pictures which will give you some insights into your basic in at nature when it comes to things like being happy, being empathetic and things like that, and do discuss its on the discussion forum has with the earlier acquit that you have done so far	test
audio_0_129176.wav	Let us see what happens at the output all right	test
audio_0_118701.wav	So, I will select wstub, and this range is 0	test
audio_0_139942.wav	so in this equation ten, this cosine delta, ah, two, three, sin delta two, three, all you get	test
audio_0_117184.wav	So, for symmetrical network if S is equal to S transpose that really means S ij is equal to S ji, where i and j can be anywhere from 1 to 3 up to N	test
audio_0_142740.wav	so this is your current i one injecting your, this current i one getting injected here and current i two from this side getting injected here	test
audio_0_2760.wav	So, that is the special characteristic of this exponential distribution	test
audio_0_133760.wav	Now let us see how these two gadgets work together, so when the stack pointer is pointing to gadget address 1 it would result in this gadget getting executed and at this particular time the stack pointer is pointing to this location	test
audio_0_114250.wav	Now, I will discuss these microwave tubes one by one	test
audio_0_101505.wav	So, both these papers are in; have been published in plus one which is an open access journal which means that you can download these papers anywhere you do not need any special access to be able to download these papers	test
audio_0_156429.wav	And again for very low frequency signals, the wavelength goes in metres	test
audio_0_298.wav	Similarly, you compute scattered matrix for x2, s2 and within class scatter matrix can be represented	test
audio_0_102839.wav	I know that these 4 correspond to B	test
audio_0_136907.wav	so this is bus one, bus two	test
audio_0_12967.wav	So, basically it is one third because 5 by 15 then 4 minus 0	test
audio_0_13102.wav	There it was delta t less than 0 greater than 0 whatever is given 0 0, but at t is equal to 0 it is undefined, but here we are taking delta t minus t 0	test
audio_0_134118.wav	So when we specify si a single instruction in this case the push instruction would get executed and we will actually look at this	test
audio_0_125430.wav	So, the point is that that is also another topic that which one is better 110 is better 230 volts is better, but if you if you take a example of a electronic equipment at our home, for example, juicer or a trimmer, it can operate on both the voltages	test
audio_0_114343.wav	Firstly, we will tell about the software interface then we will design a filter at 1 giga hertz on a sub state FR 4 whose dielectric constant is 4	test
audio_0_144176.wav	lot of things are going on	test
audio_0_116481.wav	So, bandwidth is proportional to W as well as gain is proportional to W, why gain increases, because total aperture has increased	test
audio_0_22461.wav	Go ahead	test
audio_0_14661.wav	So, now system of unit actually in all electrical engineer is this thing we deal with several measurable quantity like quantities like voltage your then current ampere right power watt and so on	test
audio_0_18724.wav	Now, what do you understand by fixed budget	test
audio_0_11377.wav	Therefore, P is equal to root 3 V L I L cos theta and Q is equal to root 3 V L I L sin theta	test
audio_0_149064.wav	and what low cost option might remove the other parties objections	test
audio_0_17713.wav	The expected growth rate in 2015 is 10 15%	test
audio_0_144859.wav	only with these qualities means good communication: listen, able, listening, having patience and developing good relationship with others	test
audio_0_126638.wav	Then after spin coating we pre bake it, so I will pre bake it at 90 degree this is my photoresist; positive photoresist	test
audio_0_137361.wav	this is actually small, small z right, so small z y in to l is equal to you can write root over, it is actually inside if you bring l l square	test
audio_0_118217.wav	So, this is the variation ofthe velocities with frequency, but the product of these 2 velocities is always a constant which is equal to c square for air filled waveguide and in general, the multiplication of phase velocity and group velocity is always a constant which is equal to mu into epsilon and one more thing, since, this phase velocity and group velocity change with the frequency it means that different frequency components travel in the waveguides with different velocities and because of this the time taken by different frequency components will be different to reach from input to output and at the output different frequency components will reach at different time instants and this effect is called as dispersion effect	test
audio_0_144820.wav	some people might get motivated just to help others	test
audio_0_133079.wav	So, for example this particular segment, which is present in hello has the, is readable, writable and executable while they segment cannot be written to, it is only read and write flags are set	test
audio_0_109763.wav	So, dry stack construction is basically mortar less construction	test
audio_0_172655.wav	So, these are the different types of interaction which which will be given from this ligand, which will be given from this ligand	test
audio_0_123523.wav	So, if you can see the screen	test
audio_0_156912.wav	At this point I will go to zero because it is starting from zero	test
audio_0_169840.wav	So this is not permitted, you can default the parameter value of a function only once	test
audio_0_164877.wav	So, this dynamic binding discussion will cover couple of modules and this is the first one and will lead us to the total understanding of the polymorphism in C++	test
audio_0_151939.wav	And then we have 3 s over s square plus 9 as it is and we have minus 7 over s square plus 9	test
audio_0_161493.wav	so there is a relationship between constraint and variable and a relationship between variable and constraint	test
audio_0_171561.wav	So, AT content equal to	test
audio_0_169678.wav	And, it is good to separate between header files and source files, as i said, like the way the library is organized	test
audio_0_135227.wav	therefore you will get theta is equal to seventy four point nine degree	test
audio_0_20153.wav	So, in this case the girls can get affected, boys also can get affected and the girls can also remain carriers	test
audio_0_163911.wav	The constructor and the initialization list has not been changed, they are exactly the same, but just the order of the data members has been swapped and as you can see here, in this I have executed this in Microsoft Visual Studio, we can see that the program crashes	test
audio_0_173144.wav	So, if you see this mutation if you mutate mutate alanine to valine either this will make a collision, steric hindrance or it can well packed depending upon where the alanine is located and how far space is available nearby this residue	test
audio_0_3297.wav	So, P G is equal to your 3 I I 1 square into R f because when you make this your what you call when you make this equivalent of this one right	test
audio_0_1959.wav	However so mean square error is that you have so many observations	test
audio_0_146401.wav	ego involvement is the next point that we need to look at: ah, core values of the self, what i like, what i dislike	test
audio_0_151035.wav	So, the gradient of a function is also an example of the vector field	test
audio_0_11278.wav	It is written here V p max is equal to root 2 V p peak value right	test
audio_0_17782.wav	Now they have also given us the total sales in metric tons	test
audio_0_122062.wav	So, banks are often considered in this configuration	test
audio_0_1576.wav	If you find that one of this corner, see all the distances of this corner points are greater than the minimum distance, then you need not go through, you should not go through that searching of any key values in that region	test
audio_0_10192.wav	So, once you get the current, so this is open circuit I am not drawing the circuit again	test
audio_0_105431.wav	As of now, we are actually examining the stack and the confinement is because of the bond with the unit above and the unit below	test
audio_0_25289.wav	So we actually desire, we desire let me write this clearly: we desire or, we would like, or we And this is an important note	test
audio_0_161258.wav	primal being a maximization problem, the optimum solutions objective function value will be greater than or equal to every feasible solutions, objective function value	test
audio_0_11949.wav	So, that will be your n I hope you have understood this right because before going to AC circuits or average value mean value and other thing, I hope you have understood this that how EMF is generated instead of directly starting by taking e is equal to E m sin omega t or i is equal to i M sin omega t	test
audio_0_163370.wav	Just the different types where giving you the clue in terms of which is the right function to call here	test
audio_0_109091.wav	If you look at each loop, which is the force displacement excursion in the positive and the negative, and if you look at one excursion, the area under the curve is representing the energy dissipated in one cycle	test
audio_0_166268.wav	And we will see there are several programming situations, there are several problems for which having such a static data member would really help	test
audio_0_104672.wav	And these adhesions are the mechanisms which enable cells to actually sense or see the surroundings, and how does the cell see	test
audio_0_153922.wav	If we have an inductor in shunt, suppose we again have a load Y equal to 0	test
audio_0_124996.wav	We have to check the output voltage, right isn't it	test
audio_0_26897.wav	in fact, X check hermitian times Y	test
audio_0_104457.wav	So, this is one case where the ECM directly influences cell migration, but you can also have situations where cells can degrade the matrix underneath	test
audio_0_2694.wav	The probability that we detect a particle within 30 seconds of starting the counter	test
audio_0_119229.wav	So, the life cycle diagram has a high correlation with this three types of generic strategies	test
audio_0_127769.wav	So, you got a better idea of what we are discussing all right	test
audio_0_13328.wav	That is omega is given, right	test
audio_0_159600.wav	that is the reason when we started we said: assume that x one and x two continue to be basic at some point	test
audio_0_148836.wav	hello friends, today we are going to take up the topic creativity in the context of creativity	test
audio_0_102233.wav	So, they confirmed rheologically that these was, so your stroma conditioned with LOX was stiffer, more linearised and had more fibrillar collagen	test
audio_0_27756.wav	The estimate of the complex parameter is unbiased, so this is the estimate of the complex parameter	test
audio_0_161191.wav	now this minimization is now changed into a maximization, which is the last thing that we need to do	test
audio_0_120041.wav	So, this x and y values may change therefore, the importance of MOST maybe more in a certain type of industry, in a certain type of situation, for a certain type of organization or in some other cases this may have a higher level of importance	test
audio_0_28019.wav	Basically, what is this	test
audio_0_172880.wav	So, you also have the option to download the data based on the non redundant datasets for the sequences as well as the structures	test
audio_0_152958.wav	So, here we have this function g t now we have to see whether g t is piecewise continuous and it is of exponential order alpha	test
audio_0_24240.wav	I have another example that we’ve already looked at and I am going to look at it from, this time from a conflict of interest perspective, because we have already applied 5 whys to this problem and we are actually going to see what is the conflict in this case	test
audio_0_110141.wav	You can have irregularities on the brick surface and therefore there will be concentration of stresses in some points and smaller level of stresses in other points	test
audio_0_154962.wav	Especially I want to emphasise for this microstrip matching networks, please go through the example that I have shown and it is also given in the notes accompanying this module, please go through it to get a better grasp on it	test
audio_0_24538.wav	Probably D1 will	test
audio_0_170155.wav	They are called engineer, manager, director and possibly in feature they will be some sells executive whatever	test
audio_0_161443.wav	these write hand side values will become objective function values	test
audio_0_124291.wav	The idea of today's lecture was to introduce you with these substrates and in particular with silicon	test
audio_0_153154.wav	And every simple closed curve in C, every simple closed curve C in this D can be continuously shrunk to a point while remaining in D	test
audio_0_170984.wav	Then in case final experimental validation is required even if you identify any lead compounds using virtual screening; the computational technique	test
audio_0_101008.wav	So, these green lines what you see are filamentous actin	test
audio_0_149668.wav	So, that is the Laplace transform of this function this heavy side function u t minus a or sometimes we denote here u a t whatever way	test
audio_0_108226.wav	Now you will proceed to estimate what the area of steel would be for this requirement	test
audio_0_132545.wav	The ROP gadget tool would do was that it would pass through the entire executable, tutorial 2 and identify all possible gadgets that it can find	test
audio_0_171513.wav	See if you see some residues you know the contacts right	test
audio_0_100258.wav	So, once you estimate for some parameter, you can generate repeatable estimations	test
audio_0_120592.wav	Today, I will focus on one of the quite interesting contemporary business model	test
audio_0_106293.wav	So, we continue this afternoon our lecture on design and we are examining design with respect to the code dealing with permissible stress approach for unreinforcedment syndrome	test
audio_0_173547.wav	So, accordingly you can use the numbers available in the BLOSUM metrics or the PAM metrics to give the weightage either the match or mismatch you give the weightage then you can give the probable alignment right this is what they use in the BLAST when they implement algorithm	test
audio_0_12965.wav	I mean direction will be upward not putting here this direction of this one will be upward	test
audio_0_172580.wav	So, here I am going to mention how many conformations you want you can change this options number of GA runs	test
audio_0_166885.wav	So, like in cases of automatic or static objects, the construction was implicit	test
audio_0_112660.wav	And you you must be familiar with let us say common emitter amplifier, common base amplifier, common collector amplifier	test
audio_0_150525.wav	En t is ft minus this Pn t	test
audio_0_103337.wav	So, this force is there and you see that this length you will have an extension delta x is your stretch	test
audio_0_107265.wav	If I were to assume that the density, it is only under gravity forces, I am not assuming the presence of other actions now	test
audio_0_153833.wav	Suppose we have this column matrix for all the voltages at the various ports and say this is my impedance matrix and suppose this column matrix is the currents presents and the various ports then this matrix is my impedance matrix	test
audio_0_24749.wav	So we traverse these level by level using these charts as well as using the levels of Whys, different Whys and figuring this out for yourself	test
audio_0_131087.wav	Essentially the load installed operation to specify memory location could cause conflicts in the cache memory resulting in a variation in the execution time	test
audio_0_155684.wav	In H plane tee again, the same principle will be followed that the electric field lines are between the surfaces which are closest to each other and the magnetic field lines will be like this, concentric to the electric fields	test
audio_0_133432.wav	Now buffer overflows are a vulnerability that allows malicious applications to enter into the systems even though they do not have a valid access	test
audio_0_134602.wav	So what we are able to achieve is that we have been able to toggle adjacent rows just by accessing memory locations at a very high rate	test
audio_0_10654.wav	So, this is a problem to you right	test
audio_0_166005.wav	So, we will also; as we go through the module, we will also try to compare and contrast between the reference and the pointer	test
audio_0_22862.wav	No, not yet right, you design it one more time right, this is again you have re empathise, you analyse what you have heard, you go back, you iterate, you modify that initial prototype of the game you created, you go back	test
audio_0_135266.wav	so if we multiply this two del[ta] delta by d t on both side, then two del d delta, d t	test
audio_0_121930.wav	And the customer surplus is the difference between the price paid and the amount the customer would have been willing to pay otherwise	test
audio_0_12683.wav	So, that require therefore and it is the portion of the complete response that decays to 0 at t tends to infinity	test
audio_0_17899.wav	Maybe you can write it down since it's the first time you are doing 1878 into 1	test
audio_0_110251.wav	So we are looking at a triangular distribution and the total width of the cracks zone is going to be based on a triangular distribution three times of t by two, one half of the thickness minus the eccentricity of the loading minus the deflection of the wall itself	test
audio_0_165971.wav	So, once g is polymorphic here, g is virtual here, irrespective of whether I simply inherit it or I inherit and override it	test
audio_0_132873.wav	So eventually after doing this over large number of different power measurements he computes the average of bucket 0 and the average of bucket 1, so this is known as the difference of means for that corresponding key guess	test
audio_0_126417.wav	And here if I want to understand then Ii would be equal to I1 right	test
audio_0_14413.wav	Now, if you look into that the speed control of a DC shunt motor right	test
audio_0_169626.wav	But you, basically it looks like an array element which is the pointer	test
audio_0_122323.wav	So, there is a front stage, on stage and then there is a back stage, where preparation of the food or your registration in the computer system or your billing when you are checking out, all of these are happening	test
audio_0_110039.wav	We bring this into this expression and we have a final expression for the ultimate moment with the knowledge of the axial compressive stress level and the compressive strength of masonry FMC	test
audio_0_149577.wav	But once we have this form here, we just need to plug the initial value here and then for instance this is the value after first iteration	test
audio_0_134502.wav	Later on, we see two different mechanisms for this particular vulnerability	test
audio_0_142113.wav	that means it is because z is your impudence that that line impudence per unit length	test
audio_0_101641.wav	Cytoskeletal organization is also dictated by actin binding proteins by actin binding proteins, these would include cross linking actin cross linking proteins like filamin, alpha actinin, formin etcetera ok	test
audio_0_11569.wav	So, this is this already I all I have explained you that how one should take	test
audio_0_162471.wav	Static cast is done primarily through polymorphic is a polymorphic cast	test
audio_0_14586.wav	So, next is is that example 6	test
audio_0_138126.wav	that means field winding also has no influence, and because of field, because field voltage is associated with the positive sequence variables and only the damper winding produces an effect in the quadrature axis	test
audio_0_118863.wav	Now we want to align, so all we need to do is we need to just rotate it	test
audio_0_166357.wav	So, after constructing this object, when I print the jobs and pages that are currently available, so I get jobs is now become 1 incremented from 0, and the number of pages remaining is 490 decremented by 10 from the 500 value	test
audio_0_20935.wav	And the very recent one at Fukushima power stations	test
audio_0_110203.wav	So that's what we're going to be looking at in this half of the lecture	test
audio_0_145341.wav	and the girl over here	test
audio_0_143468.wav	so that is your	test
audio_0_101435.wav	So, you cannot use traditional instrument used in material science like indentures which can only probe the material properties of stiff materials	test
audio_0_12921.wav	This 8 ohm is written and this 2 ampere is written and this 4 ampere is written say right, so that means, further simplification then you clear it right	test
audio_0_102477.wav	So, to answer this question what they did say they went one step further and what they did was they tracked	test
audio_0_113525.wav	4 inches, so which is not really half of a but half of a would have been 0	test
audio_0_167063.wav	They actually are identical except for the difference in the IO header	test
audio_0_139426.wav	similarly, i can choose the bus three, right	test
audio_0_131278.wav	So, Physically Unclonable Functions can be used for authenticating devices, it does not have require any stored keys, typically does not require any public key cryptography, and furthermore it also, alleviates the drawbacks of authentication with the stored keys	test
audio_0_133032.wav	So, readelf with the minus L option and then the executable and you get an output like this way	test
audio_0_1592.wav	That means they are very closely spaced	test
audio_0_134506.wav	Now the attackers again would find a way to bypass this defense mechanisms and still get their attack to run	test
audio_0_164795.wav	So, I will take the clue from a solution which we will do in C and let us assume that we just have C at hand and let say how would have solve this problem assuming the very first version where we have just two types of employees; engineers and manager	test
audio_0_165006.wav	So, base class has a function f method f derived class has inherited and then overridden this method	test
audio_0_16430.wav	So, when you do represent when you are representing like phasor right, it will be 10 by root 2	test
audio_0_156966.wav	If it doesn't supply the energy, the current will not be sustained	test
audio_0_103531.wav	So, let us briefly go through solve the measurements that in you can measure using a rheometer	test
audio_0_100823.wav	So, adhesion can still be small and cell can move, you can have 3D protrusive where, protrusion is major; A is insignificant, C is insignificant	test
audio_0_130083.wav	So, how loading effect can be removed if we use active filter over passive filters, you will see in the experiment part as well	test
audio_0_1870.wav	So, there are two major problems of the reconstruction	test
audio_0_164184.wav	A node class defines basic node information which has a data part and a link part to link to the next node in the list	test
audio_0_112316.wav	So, we will try to make this geometry	test
audio_0_20408.wav	And then emergency shutdown which is also called scram, I do not want to expand this term just equate this acronym at the moment, this is related to an emergency shutdown	test
audio_0_108376.wav	So now we have again linear elastic but we have the first we had the first stage limiting where we had zero tensile strength in the cross section, full section compressed	test
audio_0_140471.wav	so for transformer t one, this will not change, it will remain as it is because transformer rating itself has been taken as a base, that voltage as well as your volt ampere, right	test
audio_0_3579.wav	We will not discuss about the function why inter pole is for this course inter pole is there	test
audio_0_16303.wav	So, this is and this capacitor is your C eq and 1 upon C eq is equal to this one right	test
audio_0_120465.wav	So, in the traditional services or even in these hybrid services still recently channel preferences of customers determined the distribution architecture of the service	test
audio_0_116541.wav	So, in general I want to tell you please do not use very high value of epsilon r for designing rectangular microstrip antenna, or any microstrip antenna	test
audio_0_159633.wav	now does it mean that this twenty six resources have zero value per share	test
audio_0_115232.wav	So, these two metallic plates are kept in parallel with each other and fed at that ends ok	test
audio_0_138114.wav	so this is equation thirty five	test
audio_0_135236.wav	that means v t is equal to actually one point one angle theta	test
audio_0_110063.wav	When we are in that sort of a situation, it can still be dominated by a flexural mechanism	test
audio_0_152332.wav	So, this can be evaluated and then we will substitute back to this v and we are ready to find this v in this way	test
audio_0_153466.wav	So, if you draw this curve in 2 dimensional plane, then this is basically the ellipse here, because this x component is 3 cos t, the y component here is 3 sin t	test
audio_0_20569.wav	But practically speaking the nucleus itself is also not stationary	test
audio_0_127316.wav	So, if the base currents of the emitter couple transistors of a differential amplifier are 18 microampere and 22 microampere; that means, it is given by I b 1 equals to 18 microampere it is given that I b 2 equals to 22 microampere right and what we are asked determined first input bias current	test
audio_0_155513.wav	Except that instead of Z0 being same for the even and odd modes, we will have 2 different values of Z0, one for the even mode and one for the odd mode	test
