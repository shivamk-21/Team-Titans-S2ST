path	translation	split
audio_0_173110.wav	Now, the number of equations necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is in fact always 1 less than the number of principal nodes	train
audio_0_19441.wav	Okay, which is in your case, so we have assessment score	train
audio_0_64168.wav	you see this circuit where the inputs are d, t c, s d, clock and q	train
audio_0_17119.wav	It is this side right	train
audio_0_174059.wav	You have to take the help of theorem network topology	train
audio_0_169127.wav	And very soon it is hoped that it would allow a robots to serve in social spaces	train
audio_0_182397.wav	Keywords amplifiers, opams Hello, previously we have studied inverting, non inverting and difference amplifier using op amp	train
audio_0_22444.wav	8 kilonewton meter Similarly the reactions are support that is reactions are support or shear force that will be wl by 2 so 8	train
audio_0_115868.wav	Now all users and their corresponding hashed passwords are stored in a file called etc/shadow, so what happens is that for the password that is actually entered, and hash computed this is compared with the corresponding user entry in the/etc /shadow	train
audio_0_214630.wav	In this course we are using Google hangouts you can do Facebook live	train
audio_0_51985.wav	Now, we could have stopped right here; if this is all we wanted to do we could have stopped right here	train
audio_0_147418.wav	For some application you are may not be that much aware about the performance, you need very little computational capability, but there are some applications where performance is important	train
audio_0_1429.wav	So, this is 5 i 4 minus 4 i 3 is equal to; so, equation 4	train
audio_0_113379.wav	We can take any value; let us say 10 kilo ohms	train
audio_0_33604.wav	So, we had two representations, a two dimensional representation with 0s and ones and a one dimensional representation which gives us the column position for each row to keep track of the queens in the board, but in order to determine whether a square is free or not, we need to have a better way to compute how the squares are attacked by queens	train
audio_0_30438.wav	So, in fact, what we could see, that if it is not high shear means if it is low shear, we could find out eth value as this: 19343, and because of the presence of high shear, the bending moment is reduce to 18095 kilo newton	train
audio_0_65716.wav	now, if we have the planner triangulations in that graph, you can map it to a layout or a floor plan	train
audio_0_149673.wav	You learn how to pedal, you learn how to balance the vehicle, you learn how to take turns, you learn how to use break entire mechanism you learn	train
audio_0_135582.wav	So, what is the information that we have we have that the organization has only one engineering division, where engineers and managers work every engineer reports to a manager and a manager can also work as a engineer	train
audio_0_108303.wav	I have lifted it when it is on, you see here, it is on you should not lift any equipment when it is in on state, when the power is on	train
audio_0_97717.wav	And it gives empirical limits to which you can actually utilize this effective flange width	train
audio_0_170595.wav	However, Professor Paul Ekman and his colleague Wallace Friesen have built on Professor Birdwhistell’s work and they have classified kinesics into five types or five categories	train
audio_0_208692.wav	So, there is something like a cylindrical kind of portion this is the cylindrical kind of portion and there is inclined slope comes touch that in a tangent direction	train
audio_0_62271.wav	parallel on the side is one is equal to e, parallel on side is two, which is equivalent to phi, r being continuous across and interface	train
audio_0_20245.wav	So the reason I am going to give you one of the whys is the reason there is lot of smoke as you can imagine	train
audio_0_162524.wav	If the time period is short and there are no conditions attached for its conversion into cash, then you can consider it as a cash equivalent	train
audio_0_69602.wav	so we start with full custom now	train
audio_0_179624.wav	For finding out the value of k n minus 1, we have to multiply each term by s plus p to the power n as we did in this case	train
audio_0_129167.wav	Beyond this point there is a rapid rise in the rate of expansion of course this need not be perfectly a straight line you could have something like this also, okay	train
audio_0_204736.wav	So, we want to really mention those intricate dimensions also that is the reason we are showing it as a separate one with clear cut dimensioning it is having R of 0	train
audio_0_149793.wav	For example, if you look at a scale, you find that there are two points say 0 1 2 3, but between 0 and 1 also you will find ten different lines on this scale also	train
audio_0_16057.wav	So, I repeat once again for your you know understanding because and if you start in the very first year that it is one in between 0 and one that is this is t 0 is equal to 0 t 1 is equal to 1, but you have to you have to determine the charge entering the element from t is equal to 0 second to t is equal to 2 second	train
audio_0_167896.wav	Micro expressions can also be controlled voluntary and involuntary	train
audio_0_8710.wav	So, it is actually if you take the, if you take the before telling, if you take the slope of this straight line	train
audio_0_216735.wav	ok, the transport layer provides the required extension points for the message layer and in this layer the communications are all basically frame oriented	train
audio_0_40721.wav	For example, when we were discussing finite difference method is just the unknown are the values of the function at various nodes and we form our equations out of those right	train
audio_0_179014.wav	The value of derivative that is first derivative at zero and so on up to the value of derivative n minus 1 at derivative at zero	train
audio_0_70990.wav	so you have to be careful about these things	train
audio_0_50580.wav	So, then g of r r prime what was this function this was H naught	train
audio_0_130189.wav	but he had joint minor in music and here he really like music and it really helps, you know later on, whatever hobby you have a this is very important to have, that a new, you are learning music in and photography for you	train
audio_0_78379.wav	And third thing is purchase and discounting of the bills they said chore committee said that yes this should be the very important way and popular way of providing working capital finance	train
audio_0_50237.wav	So, there are N terms in this summation; of this N terms in the summation which term will survive	train
audio_0_194070.wav	It is going to have each of them is going to have about 150k MVA rating each single phase is going to have 150 MVA rating	train
audio_0_37308.wav	It is a myth nevertheless, I do not know whether most people who are genius really have bipolar, some of them we know they had right	train
audio_0_57759.wav	so this r one j this is next term is divided by r two j	train
audio_0_190281.wav	So, if the flux is at rated value, the frequency is at rated value, the voltage is at rated value, I can say the core losses will be at rated value, whereas the copper losses are very very minimal	train
audio_0_151684.wav	So, first what we will do; we will talk about little bit about series capaci[tor] capacitors also in the distribution systems ah application of series capacitor is restricted ah due to various reasons we will explain that and, but ah, but for high tension you may have series capacitors, but you need to you know have lot of protection different type of protection scheme for the series capacitors and there are many other reasons, but anyway	train
audio_0_192865.wav	Whereas, that is absent in a transformer, because there is nothing rotating there	train
audio_0_70274.wav	ok, ah, this clock i have just mentioned earlier, this clock and power routing, requires some special attention because when you have the clock signals, it is not just the issue of just allowing the signals to be distributed to the different points were should be	train
audio_0_80614.wav	We have known these formulas, these methods	train
audio_0_86942.wav	these are futuristic technologies, but these are the technologies which we will drive the future	train
audio_0_198320.wav	So this is originally what I got as Va by K phi, speed is zero I mean torque is zero	train
audio_0_109018.wav	So, we can have by taking square root; by taking square root of this particular equation	train
audio_0_184294.wav	Which region is good to use in a sense that I mean for what value of the R X in this meter we can measure it with better accuracy better appreciation ok	train
audio_0_139235.wav	But the basic points remain same that you need to copy the original object in a temporary and actually return that temporary through return by value, because that is what a post operator post incrimination operator will lead and these observations	train
audio_0_207368.wav	We will ask for another part to be opened	train
audio_0_101452.wav	So, the boundary conditions change because of the increasing wind pressure and the maximum bending moment now moves to mid height of the wall	train
audio_0_40857.wav	Put it back into this equation that gives me back my phi of r which is what I am interested in right	train
audio_0_111165.wav	So, we will right now I have covered the theoretical portion once again, small theoretical portion not ideally in depth, but what we understood is we can design this band reject filter right using and operational amplifier	train
audio_0_56170.wav	we have seen and you can see it is because a mobile charges at charges there are charger available in a conductor, it has this specific properties	train
audio_0_144541.wav	You could also have different searchers doing different parts of the job	train
audio_0_180571.wav	Therefore, the potential at this point which is V P so, V P is we can therefore, write V P using potentiality viral rule is V 2 whole divided by R 1 plus R 2 ok	train
audio_0_198746.wav	The inductance will not have any effect if it is carrying a steady current	train
audio_0_38485.wav	So, this way this whole operation takes place the external code memory access reading takes place this in this fashion	train
audio_0_184635.wav	So, that is I guess simple	train
audio_0_114877.wav	First, we load the address of the GOT table into this register called EDX	train
audio_0_164279.wav	So, their major current assets are the receivables from customers	train

audio_0_45216.wav	The field observed so, E z squared r theta right	train
audio_0_130369.wav	When you just replace OPC with CSA, in this case the replacement was fifteen percent, small increase but I would say that we can get comparable strength to Portland cement concrete	train
audio_0_196777.wav	Even though the torque may be a constant or the torque deliverability of the machine is a constant, the power is the product of torque and speed	train
audio_0_59033.wav	so this becomes one forth of epsilon zero t, zero square	train
audio_0_66699.wav	so when you are translating a design specification finally into your layout level specification, there can be some bugs which can creep in during this translation	train
audio_0_63164.wav	in these constraints, the static timing analysis can be, can be inbuilt some results of sta and there is some objective function defined which we are trying to optimize	train
audio_0_2642.wav	That single one line means single line one line voltage, one line voltage I mean one is star connected source is given this right	train
audio_0_154768.wav	So, car stopped I said we both are alive; that means, it has happened at least 1 kilometer away from us	train
audio_0_80895.wav	Now, for example in this case we have written many organizations have developed such rules of thumb or the threshold levels as investigate all variances exceeding rupees 5,000 or 25% of the expected cost sales whichever is lower	train
audio_0_164431.wav	The next type of ratios are known as activity ratios	train
audio_0_200161.wav	Now again the details of all of these things you may find in device physics course but for us there are three terminals it is usually drawn like this	train
audio_0_65326.wav	this is how you define u	train
audio_0_43727.wav	Now s of course does not come by itself	train
audio_0_184436.wav	So, connect one voltage source plus minus the other side at ground	train
audio_0_76165.wav	If you produce one unit your variable overheads will be in that proportion and if you use go for the production of 10,000 units your variable overheads will be like that	train
audio_0_170382.wav	On the other hand, if the average speed is too fast the listener does not have enough time to interpret fully the message and therefore, would also end up losing interest	train
audio_0_116384.wav	Now in addition to the MMU the cache memory present in Trustzone enabled ARM processors is also modified	train
audio_0_157614.wav	Remember, that things are not so crystal clear and things are not presented in an isolated way	train
audio_0_201399.wav	So, the idea here is that if we don't move too far away, let me call this the original solution	train
audio_0_39405.wav	That is why I wrote that W m can either be N i e or some linear combination of N i e’s my basic objective is to get enough equations and enough variables	train

audio_0_84028.wav	If you are given the information for 2, that is the information with regard to contribution or profit, contribution in the period one, year one, contribution in the air two, sales in the air one, sales in the air two, you can take the difference, that is a change from year one to year two, you take the difference in both the figures that is in the contribution or profit and sales, and then you can find the PV ratio also in this way or in this manner	train
audio_0_53084.wav	We have looked at the waveforms, the input output relationship, and also how to design and simulate them	train
audio_0_144739.wav	Building closer ties is an obvious outcome because once the university starts commercializing its research and publicizing the technology that is patented by its industry would be interested in having closer ties with the university and the money that is generated from research can be pulled back into running the centre and also in into further research	train
audio_0_71878.wav	so when c is zero, it means that i have a open switch	train
audio_0_48266.wav	So, now having seen this now that you have refresh your memory about it, if I ask you what would be some of the problems with this approach in terms of accuracy	train

audio_0_154475.wav	So, if you make D 2 will be 0	train
audio_0_163860.wav	So, over a period of three years, you can see there is a gradual rise in current asset	train
audio_0_49193.wav	So, I cannot immediately use this equation 4 to solve equation 3, but does it look impossible to do	train
audio_0_34020.wav	So, we cannot say that i is of type int or x is of type float, rather it depends on what values assigned and in particular, if a name is used for the first time without assigning a value then python will complain	train
audio_0_128654.wav	So I don’t know why he had a paste with such high ten micron pores	train
audio_0_173110.wav	Now, the number of equations necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is in fact always 1 less than the number of principal nodes	train

audio_0_31584.wav	This is something we can naturally compute using a for loop	train
audio_0_60583.wav	so that means there must be a delta function somewhere	train
audio_0_183481.wav	So, now, V o so, let us use this equation V o is VN times this	train
audio_0_181228.wav	So, if this is my come	train

audio_0_146743.wav	One end of the bulb is directly connected to NO output pin of this relay	train
audio_0_84012.wav	So you always keep this equation in mind	train
audio_0_185671.wav	So, normally there is no current, so, the coil will not move normally, but if the coil starts to rotate due to any reason, if the coils say if the coil is moving, then what happens	train
audio_0_33423.wav	So, instead of going line by line through the list readlines we can take the entire list contents and just output it directly through writelines, this is an alternative way where I have replaced	train
audio_0_148176.wav	And of course, it is limited just by imagination, there is a huge set of applications	train
audio_0_45207.wav	They will say that obeyed and you do not know what is outside and nothing came back	train

audio_0_57837.wav	another example of this i am going to take relates to diffusion	train
audio_0_66361.wav	sw, that charging and discharging cycle will be repeating so many times over a time interval, t	train
audio_0_130289.wav	Again that will depend upon the amount of anhydrite or gypsum	train
audio_0_103568.wav	So, in the exercise that you have been doing, you have not accounted for, we have neglected the effect of accidental eccentricity, but within a design framework you cannot do that and the code requires that accidental eccentricity be considered	train
audio_0_71923.wav	so, as a rule of thumb, most of the systems we design, we have to limit clock skew to within ten percent	train
audio_0_33356.wav	In other words, if you are going to transfer this from one file to another, you do not want to worry reinserting the backslash n because this is already there	train
audio_0_1546.wav	If you have any if you have any other thing if you have that is that is your what we call that is your philosophy right, so V p angle minus 240 degree, suppose it is multiplied by 1	train
audio_0_105387.wav	tThe signals between f L and f H we cannot pass	train
audio_0_138696.wav	But you can use some of the language features to handle errors in a more structured way and instead, there are several libraries which is the part of the standard library which give you additional feature to be able to handle those errors	train
audio_0_64654.wav	one neighbour of this cell will also be a one neighbour of this cell will be one, this will be one	train
audio_0_202757.wav	I will show RL like this but it is exactly the same as what you have here	train
audio_0_13366.wav	So, question is that that resistor actually will see here it is mark plus minus there 4 ohm here it is minus plus , and then ohms' law and kb KVL your what you call will apply , right	train
audio_0_209019.wav	These two points because of light we cannot really see into two points, but only one point as that we will see	train
audio_0_65531.wav	so you see, since a is coming out straight, so here the delay will be five	train
audio_0_50348.wav	So, epsilon can be complex and mu also can be complex right	train
audio_0_48871.wav	I is known after I solve the integral equations very good what is Za now	train
audio_0_2255.wav	And so ignoring the voltage drop in primary reactance is not quite justified right	train
audio_0_216663.wav	so we use a thermometer, an industrial thermometer, contact based	train
audio_0_182250.wav	And, the average value so, for input 0 because it is positive for half of the times, negative for half of the times	train
audio_0_118785.wav	So, we want to find the following at 2 temperatures; one is 77 Kelvin and the other is 300 Kelvin	train
audio_0_69970.wav	but if they are switching in the opposite direction, so one of them is going from zero to one and the other is going from one to zero, then the difference in voltages can be twice two	train
audio_0_195496.wav	Now that we have said that this e1, which is corresponding to the flux, established that flux is the one which causes the core losses and the flux, is established because of the magnetising current, which have flown even under no load condition	train
audio_0_194003.wav	Because the air gap is uniform	train

audio_0_131290.wav	Once the multiple cracking has happened then all the tensile stress is taken by the textile	train
audio_0_158141.wav	So, 9 chunks will primarily mean that 9 into 3 if you are making a chunk of 3	train
audio_0_208301.wav	If, it is a plane this entire plane revolves around this axis, then we will get a conical frustum of solid object; that means, material will be filled inside also	train

audio_0_185319.wav	Therefore, if the turns ratio is a, then the reflected impedance between these two points, you can compute we did it assuming a ideal transformers	train
audio_0_210393.wav	Wherever you move this drafter, it always shows only horizontal and vertical directions	train
audio_0_154040.wav	So, if you write V A is equal to ah your ah V 0 minus I 1 is i A plus i B plus i C into z 1, z 1 means r 1 plus j x 1 this branch one right this is your ah first voltage drop I A plus I B plus I C r 1 plus j x 1 right	train
audio_0_63555.wav	so from the netlist that you get from the front end design, we can do some circuit partitioning, then we can do possibly floor planning and placement, routing and then the final layout	train
audio_0_162730.wav	Now suppose just for discussion if the cost of this item would have been 40,000, what we would have done	train
audio_0_34111.wav	So, plus literally puts s followed by t, it does not introduce punctuation, any separation, any space and this is as you would like it	train
audio_0_185291.wav	So, we see that I 1 is equal to I 0 plus I 2 prime	train
audio_0_199183.wav	that could be chosen	train
audio_0_185112.wav	So, ideally we would like to have so, zero is never possible	train
audio_0_107698.wav	59 kilo hertz and above that it will not allow; that means, you can see the change in the peak voltage	train
audio_0_165628.wav	They are also going to be shares in future	train
audio_0_108043.wav	The circuit is that the input signal, the input signal is given to inverting terminal right; that means, it is an inverting amplifier	train
audio_0_165012.wav	Apart from that, they have got voting right for doing several things like appointing auditors, like taking major business decisions for merger submergamation or for making fresh issue, for coming out with right issue or for for taking a very large quantum of loan	train
audio_0_82651.wav	One profit is which we calculate in the cost sheet	train
audio_0_209711.wav	And, here somewhere we have to mark first of all a’; a’ is always be 10 so, at 10 distance a’ we have ok	train
audio_0_138365.wav	First, we have talked about the containers, arrays, structures and unions; the three main types of containers that C provide; and we have talked of managing the different variables and addresses through pointers	train
audio_0_41435.wav	We have already knew this intuitively, but forward problem looking at this equation is what	train
audio_0_71593.wav	let me give an example which can give you the idea	train
audio_0_185808.wav	So, in this case scale is non uniform	train
audio_0_147098.wav	Let us look at the program logic first, then we shall be showing you the code	train
audio_0_134866.wav	Here the problem is I have two classes, I have a vector class which keeps a linear vector of a size n, and have a matrix class which keeps a square matrix, not necessarily square matrix it is a keeps a matrix of m by n dimension	train
audio_0_206274.wav	And this will have many sub drawing sheets having thrusters separately, having gyroscope separately, compartmental space separately, even nuts and bolts separately supplied to these industries	train
audio_0_74994.wav	So now we are left with the 90% of that 4 lakhs to be collected	train
audio_0_146117.wav	If you have a reverse version of subtract then that flexible operand can be subtracted from or the normal data	train
audio_0_152533.wav	Now we have assumed that conductor is coated with your what you call ice and uniform thickness	train
audio_0_150194.wav	Now you can see that the weight is slightly towards the individual who is on the B side and then the question basically asks is that who would experience the heaviness of this load more compare to the other one similarly	train
audio_0_17052.wav	Then, we want that what will be i 0 plus current division, then it will be for current division path it is multiplied by 6 divided by 6 plus 60 right	train
audio_0_168527.wav	The complete picture emerges before us only when we combine the two	train
audio_0_63479.wav	so if you do not do it, then the following logic block, like a same kind of scenario: driving clock, receiving clock	train
audio_0_164759.wav	But it is not investment, it's not finance also	train
audio_0_195060.wav	So, what I get actually as Wsc will be Isc square multiplied by R1 plus R2 dash, right	train
audio_0_108787.wav	Hhow peak detector works, then we can make the circuit, which we have made on the breadboard and finally, you are able to look at the finally, you are able to look at the simulation right using the Mmulti saime	train
audio_0_201919.wav	This is again something that we know	train
audio_0_13660.wav	Next this current source, it is independent current source; So, turned it off, but means it will be open circuit right	train
audio_0_134778.wav	This is more of a recap for you, this is a C program which is trying to reverse the string as you can see the stack is defined as a structure, which has an array which is the container of the elements and a marker which is a top index which will keep the current index of the top most element, and these are the implementation of the four functions empty, top, bush and pop; empty just checks if the top value is minus 1, minus 1 designates that there is no element because are the minimum index value in the array could be 0	train
audio_0_51033.wav	So, rho mn is rm minus rn the distance between the centers of the squares or circles that is rho mn right ok	train
audio_0_166343.wav	It causes priority inversion and unbounded priority inversion two very bad problems	train
audio_0_43946.wav	Boundaries not just boundaries the location of the triangles, the nodes of those triangles right that is of interest to me because based on that like we did in the previous slide I can calculate the matrix	train
audio_0_174081.wav	That means that our initial direction of current was clockwise but finally the direction of current is anti clockwise	train
audio_0_58460.wav	so, and that's the same all over the surface because it's a conducting surface times: sigma two, d s, sigma two	train
audio_0_31848.wav	And anything which is not in this case, so if I have a nonzero value as a number or if I have a nonempty string a string with seven characters or a nonempty list a list with three values then all of these would be interpreted as true if I just stick them into a condition	train
audio_0_16050.wav	So, 0 to 1 that is t 0 is equal to 0 and t 1 is equal to 1 right and then this one then t 1 to t t 1 is equal to 1 then 1 to 2 second and t is equal to 2 what is the idt this is the idt	train
audio_0_154805.wav	So, next we will come to the lightning surges; so, the voltage produce on the overhead lines by lightning may be due to indirect stroke or direct stroke	train

audio_0_147777.wav	If you look into the motor, it is rotating at a slower speed	train
audio_0_117195.wav	Now achieving Data Obfuscation for the computational case is far more difficult	train
audio_0_201880.wav	So, we don't have DC signals	train
audio_0_65536.wav	after we carry out static timing analysis we find out that there are lot of timing requirements which are not been met	train
audio_0_97045.wav	So you can see that at H by D of 25, the stress reduction factor with no eccentricity of the load is one	train
audio_0_104783.wav	So, we can have some band which is around this value, right	train
audio_0_104334.wav	It's simply because your superimposed loads are not always designed to sit concentrically with the wall	train
audio_0_174925.wav	Our objective is to adjust the load parameter, that is RL and XL	train
audio_0_47734.wav	Nothing will happen	train
audio_0_102795.wav	97 we use it in the previous expression m dash divided by 215	train

audio_0_201336.wav	7 you know that the new solution is simply proportional to the new value of VS	train
audio_0_206661.wav	If that is the case how these views really look like on vertical plane and horizontal plane	train
audio_0_17331.wav	Also there is this I think this is great app if I can use it efficiently plus I won’t be able to carry this bag	train
audio_0_183334.wav	So, water flow rate is constant and say this is equal to m gram per second	train
audio_0_198741.wav	So, I am going to have somewhat more difficulty in terms of changing over the current from plus to minus or minus to plus which we would look with the magnifying glass in greater detail about commutation that will be the next discussion after looking at different type of generators	train
audio_0_35999.wav	We take max of the solution from i and the solution from j plus 1	train
audio_0_182589.wav	Analog means what	train
audio_0_44360.wav	Involves the a i’s; obviously, m of them involves a i ok, but our number of variables in this problem has become how much now	train
audio_0_48455.wav	plus 0	train
audio_0_40268.wav	This right hand side over here is going to be the way I am going to impose the boundary condition	train

audio_0_113621.wav	Depletion type mos transistor then we will continue the next class right now what we have seen we have seen that if you are given a n channel MOSFET and enhancement type MOSFET, how the MOSFET will operate how can we understand the different cases, when we apply different drain to source voltage, what about the drain transfer characteristics for the enhancement type MOSFET	train
audio_0_175287.wav	So, if you look at this particular figure, this is one port network where the current goes in to the linear network and comes out from the other terminal and voltage is applied across these two terminals	train
audio_0_150746.wav	So, particularly for transformer impulse test if you do so, you may not get that ideal value, but this is the standard you have to see around that only	train
audio_0_87570.wav	So, second this what you want to achieve why test bed for studying myelinating disorders sclerosis where myelination is destroyed	train
audio_0_153529.wav	So, this this R Id square will remain in the circuit any circuit	train
audio_0_173322.wav	So, since B2 is responsible for changing the displacement from x1 to x2, so, we connect B2 between x1 and x2	train
audio_0_103014.wav	So, the rotation of the unit then becomes the basis for formulating the stress strain relationships at the unit level	train
audio_0_107949.wav	We we will see how we can design another kind of oscillator, that is your crystal oscillator,; that is your crystal oscillator which is very stable oscillator crystal oscillator	train
audio_0_46761.wav	So, the input impedance that you have calculated for a single antenna in free space you were very happy about it, you put it into an electromagnetic environment where there are various objects and suddenly you find that your you know your performance is not so good right	train
audio_0_215327.wav	So, make sure that that does not happen	train
audio_0_127573.wav	So, it is very, very alkaline but it is consistently alkaline because it such readily buffers the solution and you have a constant high pH in your environment	train
audio_0_212402.wav	This is the top view, complete circle visible	train
audio_0_70917.wav	so the transistor, like here is represented on the schematic like this: the solid, this is the top view diffusion on the lower layer and top of which the polysilicon layer in red which is the gate	train
audio_0_194642.wav	Because some for time I am going to see that B is under the influence of South Pole after sometime the same conductor will rotate, will be rotated by 180 degrees because of which it will occupied the position of A	train
audio_0_39973.wav	So, what is saying is that the displacement field can depend on electric field in different directions	train
audio_0_62729.wav	now, again, i have said that in a typical vlsi design flow you cannot do the thing in one go	train

audio_0_152387.wav	So, you can calculate easily at instead of calculating directly I am writing S 1 into sin of cos inverse theta 1 right	train
audio_0_147453.wav	This is the task of the designer	train
audio_0_123933.wav	Now, VSWR was a very important concept in the olden days when we could not directly measure the reflection coefficient	train
audio_0_105319.wav	and n Now he is changing the frequency	train
audio_0_193469.wav	So, based on this let me try to work out 1 problem on this or the induction motor you know performance characteristics	train
audio_0_103578.wav	That's something of a simplification in this particular case, but in the other direction the center of stiffness and the center of mass along the x axis are not coincident and therefore that eccentricity is what is going to cause the torsion in the system when earthquake action in the y direction is considered	train
audio_0_206985.wav	Reverse the direction, so there is up to the surface; so click up to the surface, control button, then click this surface	train
audio_0_175920.wav	S is called as apparent power because it is defined as a product of rms voltage and current	train
audio_0_194471.wav	So we will be repeatedly using in these form getting our power or phasor diagram equivalence circuit, all of them in transformers, AC machines and so on	train
audio_0_172212.wav	Because the topology shows us the property of the network which is unaffected when we stretch, twist or distort the size and shape of the network	train

audio_0_52154.wav	Less than this right I have to sample at least the Nyquist rate in order to correctly rep correctly represent this thing over here and at the same time we have our Courant factor right	train
audio_0_167556.wav	The idea here is that we allow only a fixed set of priority	train
audio_0_35042.wav	In the same way if I want a dictionary I have to give it a completely new name like this	train
audio_0_68908.wav	again, you see, here the method is similar, but the sequence of cut lines are a little different, as i will show with an example	train
audio_0_11102.wav	So, it is average heating effect is proportional to this right this and therefore, I square we write like this, i 1 square plus i 2 square plus i n square upon n and therefore, your I is equal to square root of i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square by n right	train
audio_0_210690.wav	We can repeat it to construct the symmetric points on the other side after that join them to construct this parabola	train
audio_0_199406.wav	The feedback has to be in the correct sense and the transistor has to be in saturation for it to behave like a good amplifier	train

audio_0_67518.wav	now you can understand, you can provide realistic estimate of the wire delays, provided you already had made some placement	train
audio_0_46878.wav	Now, there you may not care that the permittivity is 3 or 3	train
audio_0_18947.wav	This is popularly known as just in time in some factories have this implemented, so there is no need for a warehouse	train
audio_0_143251.wav	The national evolution largely pertained to the limits of copyright; copyright like patent was enforced only within the boundaries of a particular country	train
audio_0_125250.wav	But how do we build such a thing	train
audio_0_23697.wav	These are some application of tension member where, in case of cable stayed bridge, we need to design tension, the stay cables and similarly, in case of truss members, few members become tension	train
audio_0_85989.wav	So, it means there is a reduction by the production by 1,000 units	train
audio_0_148497.wav	You need a D/A converter of n bits, after n clock pulses this EOC signal will be made high	train
audio_0_95104.wav	So, this amount that we are willing to invest today for which we are expecting that some benefit will occur might be after n years or a number of years or so	train
audio_0_65405.wav	right, we shall come back to this	train
audio_0_173441.wav	So, what is the condition	train
audio_0_213072.wav	First I will make something like a rectangular block	train
audio_0_40340.wav	It yeah you; so, I can write this in terms of r dash dr dash d theta and then gets converted to rho d rho d theta	train

audio_0_206495.wav	Now, I would like to adjust this center line distance or perhaps length, then Smart Dimensions I can use it	train
audio_0_7161.wav	So, in this case, that is why it is given i is equal to minus v by 10, it is minus 10 ampere and the capacitor at capacitor voltage I mean if you look into the circuit when switch is open at t is equal to 0, the capacitor volt that means, as soon as it is open, it this voltage source should not be there because it is disconnected and that is at t is equal to 0 it is open	train
audio_0_33582.wav	Now, if we have actually put the last queen, if I was N minus 1 then this is the last queen right	train
audio_0_79735.wav	5 hours then the total output will be 810 units	train
audio_0_113816.wav	there is an infinite loop in the spy process and for each cache set the spy process creates certain load instructions, which accesses all the ways of that particular cache set, while this is done the spy also times these load instructions	train

audio_0_38708.wav	1 is serial output data; so, this we have already discussed	train
audio_0_175622.wav	So the impedance of these three circuit elements which we discussed will become Zs for the resistance will be only R, for inductive it will be Zs is equals to sL, for capacitor the Zs it would be 1 upon sC	train
audio_0_117519.wav	We looked at how the processor actually managed the memory, how it actually allocated memory regions for enclaves, how things were actually stored in the enclave and so on	train

audio_0_71858.wav	but if clock is zero, lets say, then both this inputs of the nand gate are zero and zero	train
audio_0_7694.wav	So, it is coming 2076 watt right	train
audio_0_215902.wav	So, why are these design principles and strategies important	train
audio_0_104610.wav	So, if we are using an inverting amplifier, feedback should introduce 180 degree phase shift; if we are using a non non inverting amplifier, feedback should not introduce any phase shift right	train
audio_0_73360.wav	that can be a multiple levels of synthesis, as you will see little later	train
audio_0_184656.wav	So, need not remember the values like what is called low resistance	train
audio_0_131744.wav	Now there are various ways of understanding of what porosity is and how to actually study the permeability of the systems in concrete, but one of the common methods of understanding porosity and the distribution of the pores size is mercury intrusion porosimetry	train

audio_0_146776.wav	I make it off, and then I make “val” equals to 1	train
audio_0_131670.wav	1percent but look at the same amount of carbon nano tube, the increase in mortar is even higher, this is cannot, you cannot prove, cannot model this with composite material approach, same thing more or less with concrete and I will show you why this is but so we thought that this is quite interesting	train
audio_0_32958.wav	Then if n divides m if the remainder of m divided by n is 0 we return n and we are done, otherwise we return the gcd of n and the remainder, so this is the remainder	train
audio_0_141766.wav	Now, the teaching function started off as a way to spread knowledge and in fact the reason why people enroll in universities is to gain knowledge	train
audio_0_217062.wav	these are clients, client, this is a client, client one, and is goes on like this	train
audio_0_211501.wav	And if you are looking back side part, it looks like; perhaps if it is made with a plastic a very thin material, this is the part where we have this plastic material and the remaining place is empty	train

audio_0_105513.wav	The advantages of op amps are it is low cost, right less power consumption, more compact, more reliable, high gain and easy design	train
audio_0_36561.wav	So, we want i, i plus k, i plus 2 k and so on, we do this by giving a third argument	train
audio_0_68714.wav	so in a moore machine the output depends only on the state variables, ah, but in contrast, in the milli machine, the output depends not only on the state but also on the present input	train
audio_0_83100.wav	We are given this closing balance sheet	train
audio_0_204613.wav	Similarly, from here to here also we are showing outside and here to here also outside	train
audio_0_129604.wav	And then after two or three hours the rate of heat evolution starts to increase again to a maximum at about ten hours and then it decreases	train
audio_0_110080.wav	Till then you take care, have a nice day, bye	train
audio_0_83847.wav	So, it means this cost becomes 17 lakhs and 60,000s	train
audio_0_193555.wav	So we are going to look at actually if you look at electrical to mechanical energy conversion, one of the examples is an actuator or a relay	train
audio_0_211179.wav	In coincident mate the two things that we we want to assemble or mate will coincide	train
audio_0_69466.wav	because the true critical paths will actually determine the minimum cycle time for which the circuit will function	train
audio_0_126670.wav	V D S on the other hand continues to be a sinusoid	train
audio_0_19001.wav	So how do we track the performance of the child	train

audio_0_127445.wav	This is what happens when you have iron and it is corroding	train
audio_0_210045.wav	So, from A B we draw a horizontal line first, first of all we we draw a horizontal line, with respect to that 30 degrees here and with respect to that 30 degrees	train
audio_0_114374.wav	In the next lecture we will also, look at Arbiter PUF and we will also, compare the Ring Oscillator PUF and the Arbiter PUF and see what are the characteristics and where each one can be used, thank you	train
audio_0_209281.wav	But internally if you are looking that projection whatever we are getting on the 3rd quadrant that mirror, if we flip it see that we will get that projection	train
audio_0_24391.wav	So the free space uhh will be much more as respect to RCC and also as it is lighter	train
audio_0_110897.wav	This that is why; in most of the cases, you will see that people do not use passive filter because there is aof the loading effect, in clearly see a loading effect coming into play if we keep on increasing the frequency	train
audio_0_50146.wav	So, how these equation for different from previous ones was because of the coupled nature and also these are boundary integrals	train

audio_0_149505.wav	I could be an given a state of mind for a relatively longer period of time which runs into months, weeks, days or couple of hours	train
audio_0_207827.wav	And when we are looking from top view this a to f line always be visible, we join it, and c to d also visible, so we join that	train
audio_0_70636.wav	so a is here, e is here, i is here	train
audio_0_59886.wav	Then, why I am introducing such an idea of a field	train
audio_0_212158.wav	So, call that one as P 2	train
audio_0_215050.wav	Even if you are using something minimal like an html page, the same idea can be used that you sequence some content either video or text content followed by an learning by doing activity followed by the next piece of content and so on	train
audio_0_214764.wav	Once you click on the desired week, you will find all the learning dialogues for that week numbered sequentially	train
audio_0_195697.wav	Then next one, what we are going to look at this Va control	train
audio_0_56281.wav	vector is in the positive z direction because i am going counter clockwise: d x, d, y and this gives me the area of the unit circle and therefore this is minus pi, r square minus two pi	train
audio_0_6404.wav	So, therefore, we can say that the resistor is a linear element, because if voltage current relationship satisfied both homogeneity and additivity properties right	train
audio_0_72792.wav	you try to try to avoid from falling into the local minima because there can be another minimum which is even better	train
audio_0_209592.wav	This is the way the line in 3 D supposed to look like	train
audio_0_48416.wav	We are integrating over e 1 this is your expression for u U and U 1	train

audio_0_210052.wav	So, with H length we will connect these points and join it like a box, always parallel to our principal axis	train
audio_0_193585.wav	So I can have actually on one side I can have electrical energy input and it is going to go through a magnetic via media because actually the magnetic medium is not going to contribute towards any energy directly, it is only serving as a conduit between the electrical energy and mechanical energy	train
audio_0_207607.wav	So, let us join freehand sketch	train
audio_0_185516.wav	So, this is known this V 1 is given ok	train
audio_0_34800.wav	What we saw in this example is a new kind of loop	train
audio_0_72667.wav	and the point to note is that when you have a large system, usually the total circuit is divided across a number of printed circuit boards, whereby we get the system	train
audio_0_199691.wav	But what happens is if the value of RL changes, if you choose a different load resistance, the gain will change	train
audio_0_39625.wav	So, equation for H y was the following	train
audio_0_197943.wav	So, synchronous motor is not going to be self starting	train

audio_0_168024.wav	It is also interesting to note that thumb gestures are secondary gestures and they are always a part of a cluster, they are never independently read	train
audio_0_206470.wav	The next part when we are constructing it in centimeters, if we are not careful enough these objects we may not be in a position to make and there will be a problem	train
audio_0_73486.wav	during global routing, as i said you recall our earlier lectures the entire routing region, or space that is available on the chip, that is typically partitioned into a set of rectangular routing regions	train
audio_0_209284.wav	Let us call this is a mirror	train
audio_0_173341.wav	So, if you see here you have the C1 and R1 these are in parallel	train
audio_0_20668.wav	So we could actually have an arrangement	train
audio_0_190352.wav	So I will have energy and co energy to be equal to each other	train
audio_0_140988.wav	So, we will advise that you use some IDE, which is open source	train
audio_0_84639.wav	So, the contribution margin has got reduced by this amount	train
audio_0_62218.wav	these are materials which do not have any polarization by themselves, but if they are put in a medium, in electric field, not in the medium	train
audio_0_68314.wav	in the mikami tabuchi algorithm, along the lines, i am looking at every grid points and i am running so many perpendicular lines along each of the grid points	train
audio_0_168873.wav	We feel threatened when somebody intentionally or accidentally encroaches upon this bubble	train

audio_0_95124.wav	NPV as the short form is NPV and P V is transferred this net present value	train
audio_0_170270.wav	It is elements for example voice, speed, pitch, pause, rhythm, volume, stress and tone modify the meanings of what we have to say and at the same time at nuances to the spoken word	train
audio_0_33907.wav	We use the same trick	train
audio_0_50046.wav	Not surprising, I started with a vector in the z direction curl of it give me something in the x y plane right, so this is my equation	train
audio_0_12779.wav	Because angular line between 0 and a 360 degree so, and it is moving your either here we are taking anticlockwise either clockwise or anticlockwise what isoever the phasor is a rotating vector right	train
audio_0_18069.wav	So prototyping building is to test the assumptions again there was a new assumption that came up, that was also added to the list, so they are going to go to the field to test these assumptions, one more point I would like to point out is they had now they have three potential users of the same system, so you can take a pic on which is your favourite or you think is the most important stakeholder in this and you can build a prototype for them, as the assumptions for them	train
audio_0_92671.wav	Then you are doing this estimation	train
audio_0_136832.wav	So, what will happen in C, if as c overrides them	train
audio_0_212518.wav	Let us begin our session	train
audio_0_215600.wav	But, it is not enough to stay with the tools, we need to also design explicit learning activities along with these tools or around these tools which actually require learners to work with their peers and effectively learn from each other	train
audio_0_23706.wav	So here one is: the hole means bolt hole, hole due to bolt	train
audio_0_130895.wav	So, in these critical conditions you need to assist the quality of concrete by means of its gas penetrability characteristics	train
audio_0_46648.wav	So, this is a right hand, right travelling wave let us call this term over here what do what would be call this term over here inside the phasor	train
audio_0_60506.wav	now i am going to calculate over this path number three	train
audio_0_189944.wav	So in this case, if I write, if I may call this as V1, if I make all this as V2, I am going to have V1 by V2 equal to N1 by N2, but I cannot write this is equal to I2 by I1 because it is open circuited, I am not going to have any current on the secondary side literally, yes	train
audio_0_102550.wav	Some codes go empirical, some codes link it to the tensile strength, the compressor strength of the unit	train
audio_0_165884.wav	So, if you remember what we said in the earlier slide is that if the scheduling points are generated by a clock interrupt, these are called as clock driven scheduler	train
audio_0_171236.wav	We look at this from a global perspective, the differences in how we interpret the expression of emotions when they originate in other cultures	train

audio_0_107838.wav	tThe frequency of oscillation generated by LC tank circuit is the frequency generator by LC will depend on what	train
audio_0_214878.wav	Similarly, we discussed practice and feedback and when you did the learning by doing activities, you saw that there was customized feedback, some of it was constructive, it pointed you to the various resources that you could go back and look at in case you are learning by doing activity response was incorrect	train
audio_0_210623.wav	So, after that at V draw a perpendicular VB is equal to VF a perpendicular VB is equal to VF, VB is equal to VF means this is VF here	train
audio_0_14780.wav	04 this is 1000, so you have to find out	train
audio_0_112892.wav	Material of interest the high energy of electron beam is transferred to the material which causes is to start evaporation or evaporating	train
audio_0_118419.wav	So, the first questions says what is the hole concentration at 300 Kelvin	train
audio_0_175060.wav	Since we have 3 unknown here R, L and C, we will fix one value R	train
audio_0_20493.wav	Of course	train
audio_0_36115.wav	In other words, we add at one end and we remove at another end	train

audio_0_69795.wav	ok, so the block will rotated in this fashion	train
audio_0_46765.wav	So, again there is a vast theory of approximate methods, but again in CEM what we will try to do is give you an exact way of calculating this, there is more it is more work, but it is a more rigorous than in the other case	train
audio_0_149507.wav	Now, there is a new alternative to it, there is something called experience sampling method, ESM, now what happens unlike the traditional questionnaire technique the paper pencil based technique or the computer assisted techniques, basically participants they fill out questionnaires at random time points throughout the day to measure the process in real time	train
audio_0_65256.wav	so after eight unit of from this point to this point, it is eight	train
audio_0_170029.wav	Without commenting on the political belief systems, I have tried to use this video as an illustration of genuine and fake smiles	train
audio_0_194763.wav	Now from 5 it will come back and it will go back to 3 now from 3 it will go progressively in the front to 6 from 6 it will come back to 4	train
audio_0_40384.wav	So, if you are interested you can read more on that	train
audio_0_112763.wav	So, I will tell you what are substrate holders I will show it to you substrate holder is the is the equipment or a tool that can hold the substrate, that can hold the substrate right now I have to evaporate this metal right and deposit on these substrates right	train
audio_0_33748.wav	Actually it is much simpler to print all solutions than it is print a single solution because we do not have to remember whether our solution extends or not it is really running through every possible solution	train
audio_0_177037.wav	Now if you simplify, what you will get R2 plus R1 by R2 into i1, so finally what is the value of i1	train
audio_0_52244.wav	So, we are not going to a redo all of it; obviously, we just want to see conceptually where does the paths diverge in the derivation	train
audio_0_167214.wav	So if the GCD is one then then at most after one time unit the task can occur	train
audio_0_11211.wav	So, nothing is drawn after these right; nothing is drawn R 1 and X 1 put it here and this is the current I 0	train
audio_0_126472.wav	Now, if Z0 for the transmission line is kept constant, then we see that ZIn is proportional to the inverse of RL	train
audio_0_147952.wav	So, these pins are Vcc, x, y, z and GND	train
audio_0_3548.wav	So, why I will spend more time on this directly I will do it	train
audio_0_11988.wav	If you come to the circuit from the circuit only, because this we have to use again and again for solving your numericals	train
audio_0_70344.wav	so if there are, say, hundred test vectors at to do this process hundred times right	train
audio_0_52786.wav	In this video capsule we shall look at the waveforms, some critical waveforms of the forward converter	train
audio_0_138532.wav	And it is very critical that you explore and a slowly get more and more familiar with this standard template library, so that your power in being able to write good C++ code also improves	train

audio_0_149201.wav	So, ones you have developed you have sharpened your analytical ability and you have understood the methods that have that scientific flavor used by psychologists and used by and large in behavioral research you would very easily be able to consider it fine all though this appears and commonsensically This is what one can deduce you yourself would not like to go ahead with that deduction the reason being that you still you doubt that this is more and more of a commonsensical thing rather than being more and more scientifically sound observation much later when we come to methods of psychology they there even we will be talking about observation is a method	train
audio_0_37138.wav	Things which they were very masochistic about	train
audio_0_150477.wav	So, this is delta E and the steady state feedback this R coming here left hand side it is like this, but as we are taken to this side this side that that is why it is your what you call this way it is minus R, so minus delta F	train
audio_0_17577.wav	But sometimes like in nowadays, but in earlier days I used to write in mobile phones	train

audio_0_109827.wav	We develop the wafer in a SU 8 developer	train
audio_0_86016.wav	One reason is that it has become unfavorable because at the we planned at the 9,000 actually 7,000 but and that is why the contribution margin has seriously declined by 24,070 which is unfavorable but that had to be because you are expecting 7,000 units to sell in the market	train
audio_0_176641.wav	It maybe visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area	train
audio_0_135185.wav	That is the basic power of the class template and this gives us lot of generalization in terms of the data structures in particular and different utility classes	train

audio_0_48355.wav	No, we are not putting the source and observation on the same line, we have always separated by A; now	train
audio_0_124377.wav	Then you might ask why are we directly going to bandpass or bandstop, from traditional filter theory, we should 1st discussed about lowpass and high pass filters	train
audio_0_156182.wav	So, this side is time, it is time T it is given here, this is time	train
audio_0_153971.wav	1, and j 0	train
audio_0_2691.wav	So, in this case your what we call that source is delta, but load is star	train
audio_0_126559.wav	It means that the total phase change over this entire feedback path should be zero or 360 degree and the total gain starting from this point all the way to through the other end then back should be 1	train
audio_0_978.wav	Now here before anything we do we have to understand little bit	train
audio_0_53566.wav	Forward converter transformer specs like the primary VA, secondary VA, it has chosen a port code 26 bar 16	train
audio_0_171756.wav	So, when we have to find out the equivalent resistance we can utilize over knowledge of Thevenins theorem and simplify the circuit to find out the equivalent resistance second when we have the dependent voltage source, we can also use the simply Kirchhoff voltage law and simplify the circuit as we do in case of mesh analysis so, whatever the approach we will take the value will remain same but, it is always better to obtain first the inductor current	train
audio_0_152378.wav	So, you have to find out all these right	train
audio_0_105561.wav	Same way the output impedance for ideal op amp would be 0, but if you see in the practical operation amplifier, this operation amplifier, then you will see that the output op amp is not 0, but close to 0, alright	train

audio_0_23901.wav	86 right ymax I can find out So once we find out ymax that means if the neutral axis is following in this way then ymax I can find out this is the bolts are there 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 so this is how so this is the ymax and maximum bolt force due to tension will be develop in the extreme one in extreme bolt the extreme top most bolt will be developing the maximum tensile force tmax so we can calculate the tmax value So tmax will become M into ymax by summation of yi square so if I put this value M was 50000 kilonewton meter and ymax was we have calculated 312	train
audio_0_150448.wav	We thankfully even went to the Indian construct, the Indian concept of personality the trigunas	train
audio_0_176061.wav	If you see this figure where current source is there, voltage source is also there so at first instant you see that this is a little bit complicated circuit and difficult to solve but actually it is much easier than what we discussed till now, how	train
audio_0_49829.wav	So, let say that I have some point over here, let us call this the origin and I am trying to plot a vector field like this	train
audio_0_65175.wav	now the question is so, when we talk about the clock signal, so what should be the time period when the here a few things	train

audio_0_195511.wav	That is what I would say as Xm	train
audio_0_129648.wav	Now when we look at discrete methods, discrete means that we have to make a sample and then at individual times we have to stop the hydration and do the complete analysis	train
audio_0_46473.wav	So, setting the field to be 0 on the boundary is not the correct boundary condition	train
audio_0_190223.wav	So, rather than doing that, if I can do something like create you know such kind of condition which will be equivalent to loading it fully without actually loading it	train
audio_0_104162.wav	So, wire mesh is placed in the plaster and then this can be a steel or a plastic wire mesh with a lot of these geogrids available today it is possible to have a rather thin joint	train
audio_0_20166.wav	So, that way no touching is satisfied whereas still the measurements are perfect because you’ve trained one of the ladies to actually do the measurements for you	train
audio_0_165187.wav	Now, we have been given a few raw transactions and directly from raw transaction we should make balance sheet on respective date on each date	train
audio_0_49296.wav	Are the other ones alright	train
audio_0_213244.wav	So, let us measure 50 mm to locate d lines, so this is 50 mm	train
audio_0_204470.wav	1, GM also increases by 10%	train
audio_0_74883.wav	So you now take it as the because this is the positive balance so this will come this side by gross profit Gp and this is how much 6 lakhs	train
audio_0_104756.wav	Amazingly easy, isn’t it	train
audio_0_145629.wav	This was not there in the 1958 act and this was again in compliance of the obligations under the world trade organization	train
audio_0_207750.wav	And its projection, as a triangle	train
audio_0_130769.wav	But I would make a general case for is that if it is all possible, let us test the real material because until we do that, we will not pick all the effects, in particular the effects of the aggregates	train
audio_0_10446.wav	So, total complex power, it will be three phase right	train
audio_0_111606.wav	Signals in the sense, that when you talk about AC signal, it is generally sine wave,	train
audio_0_200260.wav	In case of a two port network, the equivalent is a linear two port	train

audio_0_156214.wav	That exercise we will continue doing till the end	train
audio_0_138312.wav	But you know that at any point of time only one kind of data packet will come, only one data packet will come then how do you define a programming structure to store this data packet	train
audio_0_132826.wav	So, I am just using some wavy notation that this is where the derived class D is derived through a protected manner	train
audio_0_13325.wav	12 right; therefore, like your parallel resistance impedance I have the same thing we do not know 1 upon r is equal to 1 upon r 1 plus 1 upon r 2	train
audio_0_48977.wav	Curl of the first equation	train
audio_0_210957.wav	Now, if I would like to reopen that, open that	train
audio_0_172685.wav	So, what you get finally that is s to the power ny is nothing but r minus an s minus s to the power n minus y minus an minus 1 s to the power n minus 2y and so on up to minus a2sy minus a1y, so this particular figure represents the differential equation which we just written	train
audio_0_41842.wav	You can say it seems that the real part I mean the resistance is around 75 to 80 Ohms, this reactance I do not know right it's sometime I mean both the results both the methods are giving slightly different results not slightly different results	train
audio_0_109686.wav	So, if we substitute the values what will I have, 6 kilo ohm, I have value of 6 kilo ohm	train
audio_0_212211.wav	First one, second one and so on all the way to eighth one name it like A, A1, A2 and so on all the way to A7	train

audio_0_177640.wav	Similarly, in this case also if we have 2 capacitors but cannot be clubbed to represent as a single equivalent capacitor of the circuit	train
audio_0_202307.wav	And similarly if you start with a VB that is equal to VS, what you will get here will be something smaller than VS	train
audio_0_172938.wav	Let us try to understand what is capacitor	train
audio_0_174627.wav	So, that means that if the network is connected in cascaded fashion, the ABCD parameter of overall network can be V multiplication of individual ABCD parameters of the sub networks	train
audio_0_79217.wav	So, supply side has improved	train
audio_0_18981.wav	So now what you had to do was to analyze using 5 why’s and the conflict of interest, once you have that then we can jump into the solved stage	train
audio_0_192967.wav	So this will be used time and again in all your magnetic circuit calculations	train
audio_0_32631.wav	The inductive definition says that 0th Fibonacci number is 0; the first Fibonacci number is 1; and after that for two onwards, the nth Fibonacci number is obtained by sub adding the previous two	train

audio_0_36997.wav	So, people are so focused on giving medicine, doing small follow ups that to really sit back and listen to everybody woes everybody’s difficulty in sorting out their life problems; it becomes a luxury right, but that is not the way actually	train
audio_0_158293.wav	If you try to disorganize it then storage becomes problematic	train
audio_0_130955.wav	And then compare it with other material that are available and choose the material wisely with this we have come to the end of the experiment thank you for watching	train

audio_0_66869.wav	i am showing just one signal	train
audio_0_153500.wav	But as you put it here then I dash actually will be id minus j I q minus I c because it is the; that means, this much of reduction right	train
audio_0_34242.wav	So ideally you should have said something like result is equal to update, and then check after the update where the result is true or false	train
audio_0_106626.wav	And if you remember we have seen this IC earlier also right	train
audio_0_113774.wav	The allocated chunk looks something like this do you have the metadata over here corresponding to previous and the size and the various bits like n and p and you have the data which is present here while the free chunk comprises of the metadata as before the previous chunk and the size and the various flags but importantly we have the forward pointer and the back pointer present in the free chunk	train

audio_0_182295.wav	So, this current I will be; so, if I call this as V peak then this value I peak will be equal to V peak divided by R m	train
audio_0_156680.wav	There could be a situation if I know, give file name not by date, but by event okay	train
audio_0_40072.wav	Now, turns out based on what we already know, we actually cant solve this problem; we need a new mathematical technique	train
audio_0_116959.wav	So, let us look at how we go about building a sequence of instructions that creates this particular target payload that the attacker would want to execute	train
audio_0_39545.wav	I could also call it e is equal to 2 what will I call it in e is equal to 2 this is the left node or right node	train
audio_0_134701.wav	As we have already seen, when we talked about better C part of C++, we talked about references; we talked about call by reference or return by reference mechanism	train
audio_0_43492.wav	Answer is yes because	train
audio_0_34150.wav	On the other hand, if I say something like go from 0 to 7, where there is no 7th position in the string, here python will not give an error instead, it will just go up to the last position which actually exists in the string below 7	train
audio_0_14652.wav	So, this is the voltage 10 exist this is one equation, similarly for your second one, when you apply your what you call now this is the second your what you call this is the second loop and you are covering like this	train
audio_0_163908.wav	So, you can see they have a very stable EBITA around 15% because their sales have increased, their profits have increased a bit bit but otherwise as a percentage it remains constant	train
audio_0_56951.wav	lets write the potential so v at mod r equal to r is equal to one over four pi epsilon zero q over r	train

audio_0_71795.wav	ok, so, talking about clock routing now clock synchronisation is, of course, one of the most important issues in digital systems, which, or most parts, are synchronous in nature, means they are driven by a clock	train
audio_0_212349.wav	So, 30 degrees angles we should be in a position to construct every 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180	train
audio_0_116591.wav	Now as we have seen the the D flip flop which is configured in the way that we have discussed would be able to identify which of these 2 paths has arrived 1st and correspondingly we will be able to switch between 0 and 1	train
audio_0_155321.wav	So, 4 percent of f 0; that means, 4 percent of 60 that is it is for upon 100 into 60	train
audio_0_69361.wav	so you see, this l f s r does not have an external input	train
audio_0_36421.wav	So, in other words we need to assign some names to store these	train

audio_0_185351.wav	So, what will be the voltmeter reading	train
audio_0_176977.wav	So in this case the circuit variable was current flowing through 5 Ohm resistance, so using super position theorem first you removed the voltage source and then you remove the current source and finally rent flowing through 5 Ohm resistance because of both of this sources independently were summed up because it will follow linearity property	train
audio_0_10981.wav	So, it is, it may be more also, it does not matter, so when we are talking here, we talk pair of poles instead of number of pole, if you say number of pole then in this case, it is p is equal to 2 pole	train
audio_0_210574.wav	After removing how it looks like in that side view or front view, based on the direction	train
audio_0_83972.wav	Whereas in case of the absorption costing, you have only two steps	train

audio_0_67088.wav	now, this is, ah, this kind of a notation or this kind of a diagram is sometimes called as schematic, or we also sometimes refer to as a symbolic layout, but usually symbolic means each of our regions are represented by either a color or different shade	train
audio_0_140389.wav	The basic virtual function I am pointer table mechanism by which we can do things	train
audio_0_121049.wav	So, we do not take into account what is the probability of occupation in order to do that we need to look at the Fermi function	train
audio_0_39239.wav	So, clock is clock frequency will be higher if you make a SMOD equal to 1	train
audio_0_139652.wav	So, the we are contrasting that as in C, if we define something as struct, every operation we need to do with it, we need to be done through some global functions that anybody and everybody can see and use	train
audio_0_174041.wav	Suppose in this case there are n mesh and then you apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to each of the n mesh and use Ohm's law to express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents and then solve the resulting and simultaneous equations to get the mesh currents	train
audio_0_85990.wav	In this case, now we have to calculate the budgeted contribution margin per unit	train
audio_0_170259.wav	But the very fact that he was dressed in this manner suggested that he had an emotional attachment with the masses of our country and he truly represented them	train
audio_0_174098.wav	So, now, whatever the network we have, we can represent with its equivalent Thevenin voltage and Thevenin resistance	train
audio_0_181033.wav	So, what we can do we can connect one input say to the ground	train
audio_0_71646.wav	so we shall be continuing with our discussion in the next lecture	train
audio_0_17741.wav	Mostly my notebook	train
audio_0_76829.wav	So, in the previous class we learned about how to prepare the cost sheet and how to calculate the different sub costs and finally arrived at the total cost of production and the operating profit	train
audio_0_192404.wav	So voltage drop is equal to R equivalent plus JX equivalent multiplied by I load and a have to look at I load also along with its power factor, otherwise it doesn’t make sense	train
audio_0_120582.wav	So, I is nothing but J times which is Jso A expeVkT, V is 0	train
audio_0_111286.wav	Once you do it, it might come off, it and hence it is not reliable	train
audio_0_203336.wav	There is something else connected to the gate that I will add on later	train
audio_0_144723.wav	Some functions are done by the team, there internally other functions are delegated to a third party service provider	train
audio_0_52631.wav	So, biologists have done this	train
audio_0_126265.wav	What I mean is if ZL is the short then Z in will appear to be as an open or if ZL is an open then Z in will appear to be a short	train
audio_0_109105.wav	If I keep on changing the frequency, you see keep on 100 hertz; 200 or 500 hertz	train
audio_0_196491.wav	It is limited to a finite value only because of the internal impedance of the armature	train
audio_0_99886.wav	And of course, sand, cement and water together gives you the cement motor, which is another structural material that goes into composing masonry	train
audio_0_69362.wav	so there is an alternate structure of l f s r which is used more commonly for data compaction where, instead of using xor in the feedback circuit, we do like this: we use the feedback directly	train
audio_0_162392.wav	There are no pending warrants etc	train
audio_0_64036.wav	this is the correct scenario of operation	train
audio_0_112146.wav	One is P, then one is N	train
audio_0_179207.wav	And if you cross verify the the commercial interest they are more into voltage and current	train
audio_0_67601.wav	so, as i said this, all actual arrival time values shown in blue here in this diagram can be computed in order: number of vertices plus number of edges	train
audio_0_206381.wav	So, let us move parallel tolet us move parallel to this plane intersect P1 all the way to first generatrix here located by a red line	train
audio_0_194176.wav	Still what we get here is if we say that this is probably 400 volts, if it is 1 is to 1 I should have gotten 400 itself of secondary, but I am looking at phase to phase transformation	train
audio_0_120397.wav	1, gallium arsenide is 1	train
audio_0_202604.wav	Now to evaluate this limit, we just have to substitute the total quantities in here	train
audio_0_106396.wav	Here we will see how the lithography can be done on, on this particular wafer which is coated with gold	train
audio_0_112254.wav	But you see this one right, is even more complex, even more complex right see	train
audio_0_202280.wav	We will take the easier one first, which is the second one	train
audio_0_7723.wav	Now, short circuit test, here K is equal to 2	train
audio_0_184118.wav	So, I need a voltmeter or a potentiometer which is a near perfect volt meter I mean it is act with infinite resistance you can think of that I will connect here across these 2 terminals ok	train
audio_0_103224.wav	25 into diameter of the bar into the permissible tensile stress of steel or 300 m m	train
audio_0_15870.wav	4 it is your dw by dq is equal to v	train
audio_0_137125.wav	So, static data member is also an object	train
audio_0_15269.wav	So, then this is an ideal transformer the way we have represented everything as it this E 1 E 2 this is an ideal transformer that is written here, right	train
audio_0_43511.wav	So, the answer to that is not clear just from the statement of the theorem, we will have a small exercise in the homework problem where you can work it out	train
audio_0_83119.wav	That's why we have prepared the sales collection schedule	train
audio_0_199426.wav	The absolute values of voltages are also important to maintain the transistor and saturation region and you have to pick that appropriately	train
audio_0_43340.wav	Alright so, now, let us move on the next module and we will look at is Absorbing Boundary Conditions ok	train
audio_0_100571.wav	This contact of the triangular area with the rigid support is of a finite length and that depends on how quickly the material will start crushing and that distance is taken as alpha delta T	train
audio_0_149547.wav	So, they might have started the process, but then whenever they feel they have the right to withdraw	train
audio_0_83106.wav	Closing balance of the cash in the month of May is $29,000	train
audio_0_56637.wav	two f by d x square is equal to one over c square	train
audio_0_51396.wav	So, I have put an absorbing layer because I wanted to improve boundary conditions very good	train
audio_0_77273.wav	So, when we talk about the different branches of accounting you must have heard about you must have this much of the background I am sure that there are the three branches of accounting financial accounting cost accounting and management accounting	train
audio_0_7219.wav	So, that is why it is written this is actually satisfied	train
audio_0_121810.wav	So volume is nothing but A times t, so 0	train
audio_0_9821.wav	So, is V is 5 volt	train
audio_0_181267.wav	So, this will be equal to 10 milliampere, so that means, the pointer will go to the extreme right	train
audio_0_85753.wav	It may be possible that when we reduce the price of the material from 2	train
audio_0_76390.wav	But in case of the unskilled workers this has become negative and the efficiency of the unskilled workers is at question and they have not contributed as standardized as was anticipated	train
audio_0_13501.wav	So, here if you apply that outgoing this ah i 1 is entering at point p and i 2 and i 3 leaving point p, right; that means, i 1 is equal to your i 2 plus i 3, right	train
audio_0_213300.wav	From q', let us locate this 120 degrees and let us call this point as r'	train
audio_0_162698.wav	So, any amount which is spent for change of location or change of condition, then that can be added for calculating the cost of inventory	train
audio_0_176002.wav	So, for first mesh if you see the current which is flowing in this particular mesh you can apply Kirchhoff Voltage Law and find out the governing equation of this particular mesh	train
audio_0_80883.wav	So, in the sales we will calculate the sales value variance, we will calculate the sales price variance and then we will calculate the sales volume variances because value is depending upon the price and price also depends upon the volume of the production and sales	train
audio_0_104401.wav	So there is a total eccentricity, one is contributed by the eccentricity of the load, the other is contributed by the deflection of the wall itself	train
audio_0_26499.wav	52 kilonewton okay So total vertical shear we got this for which the girder has to be designed And lateral shear will be lateral shear we can find out lateral shear will be simply if I make proportional that is 9 by 243 into 465	train
audio_0_110539.wav	Till then you just read once again, whatever I have taught and I will see you in the next class	train
audio_0_132001.wav	There is some kind of miracle solution is going to come and solve everything	train
audio_0_79003.wav	In the real life organizations also what happens that is the first they develop the standards, workable standards I can say attainable standards after taking into consideration all the factors and then they mean get the actual performance when the firm goes for the actual production and this committee which is appointed by the firm for the review of the performance between the standard and actual between the standard and the actual they try to find out these variances that what these variances are the values of these variances and then they try to find out the causes for that so that next time these variances can be checked, can be plugged and our standards are more nearer to the actual production or by subversa	train
audio_0_80890.wav	Now question arises, I have already discussed this part with you during the budgeting process but again let's recall it when to investigate the variances	train
audio_0_201728.wav	So, at this point, we have 7 volts across it and 200 microamperors through it, and we want to replace it with a resistor	train
audio_0_207255.wav	The first question is; a vertical line perpendicular to both vertical plane and horizontal plane	train
audio_0_169534.wav	Because of the cultural variations we find that certain other ways of greetings are also popular	train
audio_0_103290.wav	It's important to be able to write it in terms of that stress because we know that the brick unit will fail in tension	train
audio_0_183876.wav	So, now non inverting Schmitt trigger ok	train
audio_0_10554.wav	Now, you see that example 2, it is very simple data everything is given	train
audio_0_123538.wav	So, we can go ahead and calculate the intrinsic career concentration times exponential minus e g over kT	train
audio_0_76469.wav	I have sufficiently discussed about the cost sheet and the relevance of the cost sheet and how the cost sheet is prepared	train
audio_0_207689.wav	And this part one has to construct by division of equal number of things	train
audio_0_62864.wav	now the question is how to define this regions like	train
audio_0_169748.wav	For instance if I am sitting next to you and you are over here my leg is crossed with my toe pointed toward you that is a signal that I am interested in engaged in what you are saying	train
audio_0_217236.wav	switch is	train
audio_0_109895.wav	No, absolutely not, we do not care why MEMS is using a sensor we do not care	train
audio_0_106356.wav	Then the adhesion would be better	train
audio_0_71837.wav	i am saying that whenever the clock edge comes, exactly the input will get stored in the flip flop	train
audio_0_186534.wav	And then there is the problem with methodology	train
audio_0_131470.wav	So, you got to be very careful but when you do it right you can get lovely images like this, this is my favourite image at the minute this is from limestone calcite clay cement	train
audio_0_43926.wav	So, let us see the manifestation of this nonlinearity in how does it affect us, we know it is going to affect us, but how it is going to affect us	train
audio_0_59071.wav	then the momentum coming, coming in per unit area, per unit time would be u	train
audio_0_123472.wav	So, your conductivity equation which is n e mu e plus p e mu h will be just p e mu h and once again do the numbers the case of silicon mu h is around 450 centimeter square volts per second	train
audio_0_202540.wav	And this is approximately equal to VS if R1 parallel R2 is much more than RS	train
audio_0_85572.wav	So now we will proceed further with this part and we will learn about that what is the standard cost and what is the standard costing	train
audio_0_112405.wav	That is absolutely correct, that absolutely fine no worries about that	train
audio_0_143442.wav	Topography of integrated circuits of semiconductor chips, they could be a registration for layout of integrated circuits	train

audio_0_64851.wav	just write gamma into cost s zero, s i plus cost of s i s j	train
audio_0_10516.wav	So, conductor they are conductor can be represented that is a long wire represented by cylinder right	train
audio_0_103372.wav	So, at the lintel level you will have connections between all the walls and at the floor level, at the roof of the floor level you again have these beams which are referred to as bond beams simply because they are trying to bond the orthogonal walls together, the different elements of the structure are kept together using this sort of an element	train
audio_0_20066.wav	Usually what happens like I am using a ‘but’, so that’s what comes in the way, it gets in the way and that could be the challenge that you have to overcome	train
audio_0_121063.wav	135	train
audio_0_139083.wav	We have already seen this in earlier example, in the print example we saw this that you can always call the inheritable function form your parent directly by using the class of a parent	train
audio_0_105587.wav	So, we go to the next slide, what is the next slide	train
audio_0_161462.wav	Deposit with bank with less than three months of initial maturity	train
audio_0_166938.wav	So, the utilization due to the foreground task is 50 by 100 or 0	train
audio_0_35634.wav	For instance, if we say p is equal to point 3, 2; then 3 will be passed as a, and 2 will be passed as b	train
audio_0_43418.wav	So, when I start from here what will this function look like b is 0 right	train
audio_0_117917.wav	So, the next thing that we need to do determine is the address of system and what exactly is this particular pointer	train
audio_0_79327.wav	It is a very important dimension because acceptance if you want to increase among us all the employees at every level of the firm, we will have to make this as a participative budgeting	train
audio_0_137052.wav	So, what I gain by doing this	train
audio_0_183591.wav	And we can change the position I mean the phase angle of this V out with respect to V in by moving this knob or dial	train
audio_0_216799.wav	so its like a one to many broad cast fan out	train
audio_0_70909.wav	so from the design rule i can directly convert my stick diagram into my layout	train
audio_0_216232.wav	And if you fill the entire screen with too much that is there is text on screen which is too much, there is audio playing in the background and the videos also playing somewhere down, where do I know your multimedia principles tell you this that never have all three together, audio, video and text right	train
audio_0_62577.wav	so i am going to use another identity which says curl of b is equal to j of r times mu zero and therefore j of r can be written as one over mu zero curl of b, and therefore this work i can write as one half the volume integral curl of b, dot a one over mu zero here, right, remember, we are taking these steps as we did in deriving the electrostatic energy, where we kept converting the integrals, or the integrals over charges, into integrals over the field	train
audio_0_77825.wav	It's going to be 51,500s	train
audio_0_160972.wav	It is not a loan, but the deposit is likely to be paid after two years, three years, four years, etc	train
audio_0_23899.wav	8 millimeter square and ymax we can find out ymax will be this one 312	train
audio_0_124555.wav	That is not the case here	train
audio_0_4920.wav	So we will come back to this again the continue with this problem	train
audio_0_163492.wav	It is asset like a mine	train
audio_0_50359.wav	This is small e x small e y small e z these are scalars they have nothing to do with any physical constraints similarly this del H I just write it in slightly smaller a notation 1 by h x 1 by h y and 1 by h z these are the new operators ok	train
audio_0_159723.wav	And what about 4B	train
audio_0_167404.wav	Let's see how to solve the unbounded priority inversion because this is the difficult problem	train
audio_0_17311.wav	We cannot actually edit or write on top of it but we can just download it from sites like LibGen	train
audio_0_100721.wav	d is less than 2 by 3 minus alpha, then steel is also in compression	train
audio_0_11249.wav	So, if your what you call if your 11 Volt about 11 Volt you supply a rated current that is the full load current that 2	train
audio_0_34263.wav	The question is, we have asked n to be 7 then we call this function n became 17 inside the function is n 17 now or not	train
audio_0_161504.wav	So, are you ready now to prepare the cash flow statement	train
audio_0_213716.wav	This is the 1st edge, 2nd edge, 3rd edge maybe the vertices are V 1, V 2 and V 3	train
audio_0_208125.wav	So, if I am projecting that onto horizontal plane there is a 30 degrees thing	train
audio_0_77786.wav	Then it is February and then it is March	train
audio_0_161497.wav	We will need to consider it because we are following indirect method	train
audio_0_51402.wav	If I look at my total field formulation over here well let us look at the right hand side over here right	train
audio_0_193192.wav	This is how it goes	train
audio_0_6247.wav	And current through this circuit is i, and this is the terminal a and b these 2 terminals are given, and across this terminal it is connected in series and one voltage source is there v and polarity is marked plus and minus, right	train
audio_0_70754.wav	you want to create your floorplan and you want to create your own design with respects to the rooms, spacing and so on	train
audio_0_7324.wav	And i t is equal to because I 0 is equal to your what you call, I 0 is equal to 0, then for and then it is V s upon R 1 minus e to the power minus t by tau if t greater than 0 and if we assume the initial current I 0 is equal to 0, this is equation 76, right	train
audio_0_50327.wav	So, I am just giving you information right I am not deriving it for you ok	train
audio_0_207244.wav	In principle five cases exist for this projection of lines	train
audio_0_106542.wav	You can see the top layer is photoresist	train
audio_0_114042.wav	So what is important for us is this X 86 supported instruction known as CLFLUSH, so this CLFLUSH instruction takes an address as input and flushes that particular address from all the caches present in that system	train
audio_0_154707.wav	So, square is much smaller	train
audio_0_49162.wav	So, this is our equation in the absence of object	train
audio_0_44588.wav	So, k ie, ie denotes the incident over here	train
audio_0_44565.wav	4 roughly	train
audio_0_190194.wav	The length increases, we said L by mu A is the overall reluctance	train
audio_0_63661.wav	you may find that the actual arrival time is becoming greater than the required arrival time, so there is a timing violation there	train
audio_0_16842.wav	It will be V angle 0 degree	train
audio_0_186020.wav	So, we have so, three possible solutions ok, you can call them as give there some names this point as A, this point as B, this point as C ok	train
audio_0_99.wav	So, therefore, I f is equal to V upon R f plus R f dash because this is the current I f voltage this is a parallel circuit	train
audio_0_179850.wav	So, this network would be linear 2 terminal was you want 2 short circuit these 2 terminal and find out the value of circuit current	train
audio_0_36814.wav	Classes are templates for data types and objects are instances of these classes they have a concrete data types which we use in our program	train

audio_0_197482.wav	Now, I have to slowly vary the load note down what is the terminal voltage versus load current	train
audio_0_163498.wav	So, it is necessary that though we are not paying for depreciation in cash, we should account for this loss which is not a cash loss but it is a loss of value of asset which is for generating this revenue	train
audio_0_180317.wav	So, we have a small magnet which we can hold on top of it so this is a magnet so this is a small magnet ok	train
audio_0_196269.wav	The rotor is not having rotating flux electrically; it is because the physically rotating poles	train
audio_0_166886.wav	The first point is that how do we really develop the schedule when the number of tasks become large, like slightly non trivial application where the number of tasks are, let's say, 10 or 15	train
audio_0_60851.wav	so this is consistent	train
audio_0_167528.wav	But just asking this question that suppose a task set fails the Liu Leyland's criterion and also the Liu and Lehochki's criterion, then can we safely conclude that the task set is unschedulable or is there a chance that the task set is still schedulable	train
audio_0_37392.wav	Or even going to a place of worship and narrating the problem to the god or in certain religion where you have an option of a confessing it to priest or somebody in the place of worship	train
audio_0_89774.wav	It has 3 of these amino groups which are present here also few of these amino groups present here also	train

audio_0_140806.wav	You have given an unsigned integer n	train
audio_0_128134.wav	You achieve this by extremely dense packing of particles, make the micro structure so dense so that the particles are so closed to each other stresses are transferred very nicely	train
audio_0_33501.wav	So, 8 is clearly the limit, the question is whether we can actually put 8	train
audio_0_59516.wav	so for alpha will get two, beta will get one, gamma will get two and delta will get	train
audio_0_133946.wav	So, this gives us the huge advantage in terms of being able to write very compact algebraic kind of expressions by defining our own operators for our own type and the that the length that is can go is huge	train
audio_0_63299.wav	then the second condition: maybe you optimize the worst negative slack max w n s, whats	train
audio_0_171134.wav	In these type of researches we would find that the true situation of gender roles, the stereotypes etcetera have not been objectively viewed	train
audio_0_85659.wav	So, what is the standard cost of the material	train
audio_0_216524.wav	And in face to face classes we even have much more complex tasks like projects which may or may not be part of e learning, but essentially there are many activities which cannot be automatically graded using a single correct or wrong answer	train
audio_0_179752.wav	Now, now, by current division rule, you can again find out what would be the value of current I, so we will follow again the current division rule and we will say that the value of current is again 1	train
audio_0_55177.wav	So if I go into Home and do Control H or alternate hide, it will show the hidden files with the dot prefix	train
audio_0_154763.wav	So, one day one of my students told me, Sir, I have survived today because of lightning; so, what happened	train
audio_0_81342.wav	In the previous classes we learned about the basics of management accounting and the cost sheet or the statement of the cost and learned about that how to prepare the statement of the cost, what is the purpose of the statement of the cost and how this information which is generated by the statement of the cost can be used by the managers for the important decision making	train
audio_0_100335.wav	We will conclude the part on the masonry materials and properties examining the different strengths of the constituents and the assemblies by looking at masonry in shear	train
audio_0_211607.wav	Similarly, we have this object, which can be bolted at this four locations and it has this cylindrical portion	train
audio_0_32755.wav	So, if one value it is like 5 depends on 3, 3 depends on 1, and 1 again depends on 5, because there will be no way to actually resolve this right	train
audio_0_144576.wav	Patents require registration and for filing patents there is a series of steps that the IP centre has to involve in before a patent can be filed	train
audio_0_209209.wav	This part we will see it like vertical	train
audio_0_141214.wav	Now if I implement it as a member function naturally since there are two classes involved here O stream and complex I have two choices for member functions	train
audio_0_67021.wav	so you see that here, using all these test modes, your able to, ah, get a some kind of a board level in first structure where you can test the individual chips on the board	train
audio_0_23009.wav	So if we provide 6 number of bolts then we can find out the length of splice plate so length will be if we provide 6 number of bolts that means it will be uhh 2 into pitch is we have considered 2 into 60 plus 2 into 35 right	train
audio_0_212464.wav	Whenever we have this true shape, true lengths other views always be parallel to XY plane	train
audio_0_13953.wav	So, it will be your it is L 2 Henry and it is R so it will be 0	train
audio_0_10071.wav	First we saw that is your purely resistive circuit, then we saw purely inductive circuit, then we saw purely capacitive circuit, step by step we are moving	train
audio_0_175993.wav	So, that means that we need minimum three independent equations to solve the circuit	train
audio_0_103391.wav	Okay, so this is what is the crux of a lateral load resisting single storage structure in masonry, in load bearing masonry	train
audio_0_153774.wav	next, ah, after this, we will come to the algorithm	train
audio_0_114312.wav	So, using Physically Unclonable Functions, it is not possible to actually clone a device and therefore, you get much better security	train
audio_0_13041.wav	23 sin this is the maximum value 13	train
audio_0_198676.wav	this is essentially because of the internal drop that is taking place within the machine conductors which are manifesting a resistance of Ra	train
audio_0_178325.wav	Now you see there is a circuit given in this figure	train
audio_0_171914.wav	We know that this is current it and current say il which is nothing but time dependent current	train
audio_0_154882.wav	If tower is tall, it can also happen that, but otherwise when footing resistances are high this may happen; so, this is lightning stroke and on the conductor	train

audio_0_112737.wav	If I still keep on increasing the temperature then what will happen aluminum will start evaporating	train
audio_0_37796.wav	But, his brain tells him that, boss right now I do not want a slap, hide the copy	train
audio_0_107544.wav	We have seen that that it is the input offset voltage which is more responsible for producing the output offset voltage rather than the input bias current right	train
audio_0_51905.wav	Let us move a little bit ahead with this	train
audio_0_141077.wav	Now, next we will try to see that is it that I can a default the parameters of a function in any way that I desire, or there are some basic rules or restrictions that we will need to follow	train
audio_0_175320.wav	Now to evaluate Z11 and Z21 you can find the values by connecting a voltage V1 or I1 to port 1 with port 2 open circuited, then what you will do	train

audio_0_197597.wav	So, three fourth of load first of all I can say 3 by 4 times 150 kVA, this is three fourth of full load and unity power factor means 1 is the power factor	train
audio_0_206954.wav	The other way is use fillet to really reduce this short corners	train
audio_0_58824.wav	if i have certain charge and density is rho r, then the force on this due to the electric field is going to be e times rho r and the power delivered is going to be v dot f, which is v dot e times rho r and rho v is nothing but j	train
audio_0_124324.wav	So in a microstrip line, you have, if you take a cross section of a microstrip, which I showed in the previous slide	train
audio_0_82902.wav	And this is a column for amount	train
audio_0_11991.wav	And if it is and that means, this is only V s this is not required suppose V s	train
audio_0_40408.wav	There are two additional what are called constitutive relation which tell us the relation between D and E, B and H ok	train

audio_0_181239.wav	So, particularly electrostatic instruments cannot be used for a say DC current measurement directly as it is, because it is made up of ups set of two parallel plate plates	train
audio_0_40366.wav	So, we will start with for example, the very early experiments which lets say Maxwell, Hertz, Faraday, Ampere all of these would have done and at that time they would have worked with real valued physical quantities, because that is what you measure in a lab	train
audio_0_139115.wav	So, these are by default available for built in types like int, like a double some operators are available for pointer type as well and so on	train
audio_0_168335.wav	In our understanding of proximity, the way we arrange our space which is available to us in a formal or an informal setting is also important	train
audio_0_176928.wav	So using super position theorem all though you are analyzing multiple circuits by taking 1 voltage source or 1 current source on at a time but eventually you may get the solution very early because the circuits are now simpler as compare to having the multiple sources connected and you are analyzing that circuit	train
audio_0_184693.wav	So, can we instead connect the ammeter maybe say here ok	train
audio_0_152330.wav	5 and line to like voltage it is root 3 into V it is line to line voltage is given in the numerical that is your this value for that is 4160 voltage that is your 4160 volt	train

audio_0_4127.wav	So, in this case , your what you call at this is a neutral	train
audio_0_162407.wav	Okay, so we have just calculated few important ratios here	train
audio_0_190789.wav	No, why	train
audio_0_115646.wav	So, we would hit the break point over here and then we would put another break point in line number 7	train
audio_0_71821.wav	because of the means unequal length of the wires that are used to connect the two pins, and also variability in the parasitic resistances and capacitances drivers various parameters are there, the delays can be different and because of that you can have this clock skew right	train
audio_0_88754.wav	How you can isolate these different cell types	train
audio_0_207121.wav	49 and say here it is 0; click ok	train
audio_0_191273.wav	If the generating station realizes many loads having shed off, then they have to reduce the amount of steam that they are pumping into the steam turbine right	train

audio_0_59737.wav	let me again, for the lack of space, write this is r minus r prime cubed plus x minus x prime	train
audio_0_34349.wav	So the most basic type of value that one can think of are numbers	train
audio_0_117623.wav	So, what we needed to ensure was that we needed to ensure that this particular program is confined to a specific area	train
audio_0_50762.wav	There is a delta l here and there is a delta l here, these will cancel off	train
audio_0_111076.wav	So, when you see a graph, which is something like this	train
audio_0_41561.wav	It is a matrix of size m cross n	train
audio_0_1587.wav	We will consider only balanced thing	train

audio_0_206834.wav	In the same our auxiliary plane is in this direction	train
audio_0_35694.wav	And on the other hand, if I have x and y then I can recover r as we just did for o distance it's the square root of x square plus y square, and theta so y by x is actually if you if you divided y by x you get tan of theta that is because it's sin divided by cos and the r cancels	train
audio_0_13662.wav	So, so this 6 and 3 right, so if you look into that this is open	train
audio_0_190461.wav	So I have added those two	train
audio_0_195529.wav	The transformer primary winding is energised, when it is energised it is going to establish a flux, that flux established is phi m that is confining itself to the core and the secondary winding is linked with that flux because of which you are going to get a voltage V2 induced, right	train

audio_0_56347.wav	however, if i go to microscopic scale, right, for example, if i go in charge density to very small scale, i see electrons, protons separately	train
audio_0_53268.wav	Then in such a case if I add these two I should get D plus D hat which is the D which is expected by the transistor so that is exactly what we want to do so I will do the following change here I will introduce a summer let's say this is plus and this also plus and to this plus I am introducing a small voltage source or something which gives you a constant and to that you are giving a VDC value which represents the nominal operating point so a voltage output which is coming from this and trying to modulate the PWM should correspond this will correspond I'm using correspond this is a voltage which corresponds to D plus D hat now this is what will modulate the triangle within the PWM and generate the get right now this term is called the feed forward term	train
audio_0_31637.wav	And we have found a prime, so we must add it to the list of primes	train

audio_0_178577.wav	So let us start our discussion	train
audio_0_133682.wav	So, these 5 functions have different argument types, but they are treated as one function having a common name in C++ and this feature is very powerful which will enable us to do lot of things called function overloading or as we will slowly understand an alternate name, more formal name for it is static polymorphism	train
audio_0_109180.wav	Now the peak to peak voltage start in decreasing	train

audio_0_204459.wav	I know the GM value that I want so I calculate VGS and in our example it was 3 volts and for that the current would be 100 microamperors now the problem we are facing as follows when we buy many transistors or operate the same transistor at different temperatures I won't have VT to be the same and I won't have KN to be the same	train
audio_0_148857.wav	So, what would happen you have an external stimulus, you observe the behavior and based on the observation you try to calibrate and this calibration helps you form the stimulus response association	train

audio_0_135744.wav	If you try this it is not necessary that it will print this	train
audio_0_32318.wav	So, if we start this, for instance, say 5 it will say that 5 have left a subtree	train
audio_0_173190.wav	So, if you compare both of the analysis you will come to know that mesh analysis is depending upon Kirchhoff Voltage Law and nodal analysis is depending upon Kirchhoff Current Law but sometimes in both of the cases you might need both of the Kirchhoff’s Laws that is voltage law as well as current law to solve the circuit	train
audio_0_68731.wav	so this is my clock activation logic	train
audio_0_3528.wav	So, it will be your this equation this equation for this straight line will be your V is equal to your that your	train
audio_0_197603.wav	5 or something, that is what I remember from what I calculated	train
audio_0_65411.wav	initially this input a was coming to this single input of nand gate, but now this input a must come to two different places	train

audio_0_44762.wav	This is not how Maxwell wrote, Maxwell wrote them in some slightly you know elaborate form	train
audio_0_111578.wav	Just stop by there, talk with that guy and you will see that you will learn something	train
audio_0_14446.wav	So, this why we have to see first right, so that means, sign will be that mutual you are not required mutual inductance voltage generator that sign will be negative	train
audio_0_215590.wav	You may see examples of peer review in this course also	train
audio_0_166389.wav	But after some time into the execution it needed the critical resource here	train

audio_0_103799.wav	Of course, this failure plane is going to be affected by the relative strengths that we have considered here, the value of cohesion, the value of friction coefficient, the value of tensile strength of the unit, the value of failure crushing strength of masonry and it is also going to be dependent on the ratio delta x by delta y	train
audio_0_9460.wav	So, R e 2 X e 2 expression you know all this right so, this is your what you call the voltage regulation	train
audio_0_172390.wav	Now what we have to do, we have to apply the KVL	train
audio_0_61557.wav	for this i consider a portion of gas or liquid in this which is here of length, delta x	train
audio_0_46327.wav	Will I have a x y term, only the x components get dotted with each other	train

audio_0_146758.wav	In the setup phase recall that for serial communication, we do not require explicitly any hyper terminal for Arduino, but for STM we require that	train
audio_0_143106.wav	Universities also contributed in a way that the IP that protected the initial research could be developed into new products	train
audio_0_107636.wav	So, low frequencies should pass and the frequency is calculated using the cut off frequency formula 1 /	train
audio_0_44035.wav	So, this was the left hand side right; what happened with the right hand side	train
audio_0_70911.wav	so on a substrate, p type substrate there are two diffusion regions, highly docked n regions i created	train
audio_0_131332.wav	So, this is very useful we can really see very well the disposition of the different phases and of course the pore but as we will talk about in the next part the pores, we see are only really the very large pore so it is not so useful for porosity	train
audio_0_145730.wav	M in rectilinear that is motion in a frame in which there is no external potential	train
audio_0_106277.wav	And what is insulator	train

audio_0_213417.wav	This is what we call natural method	train
audio_0_138644.wav	So, exception handling is what is very important in terms of C++ as Bjarne Stroustrup's comment shows, it is a mechanism that separates, this is the key idea that it tries to separate the circumstantial exceptional flow that is flow that arise due to these exceptional situation happening from the normal or the happy flow that we have actually designed for	train
audio_0_170578.wav	For example, if we have to appreciate a friend for something he or she has just done what exactly do we do with the help of our bodily gestures	train
audio_0_41134.wav	For equation 2, the same logic will give me a different contour right	train
audio_0_174297.wav	You can not take the magnetic flux as a output variable because you cannot measure the magnetic flux directly using any operation	train
audio_0_102901.wav	We'll get on to the next component of material strengths of masonry, behavior of masonry before we get to design	train
audio_0_6583.wav	And if your i 3 is equal to 4 ampere then v 2 is equal to your 2 into i 3 that is 2 into 4 that is your 8 volt right	train
audio_0_192196.wav	But please note in the case of transformer it depended upon what kind of load I connected on the secondary side	train
audio_0_75230.wav	Because unfavorable is more than the favorable	train
audio_0_204625.wav	This is the object what we are looking at is a stepped one and the dimensions are these continuous lines with arrow heads	train
audio_0_45159.wav	So, what I am here	train
audio_0_126773.wav	And TM waves are the converse	train
audio_0_149702.wav	And now having perceived things I have learned things now, what after this	train
audio_0_3217.wav	Therefore, we can write this this equation that i t is equal to 2 minus e to the power minus 2 t is equal to we can write like this 1 plus 1 minus e to the power minus 2 t u t right	train
audio_0_136919.wav	So, it has to a defined as const, so that you cannot make any changes to it	train
audio_0_49726.wav	What is your intuitive understanding	train
audio_0_175367.wav	But we can have the hybrid parameters which we will discuss in the next lectures	train
audio_0_33259.wav	So, what we do is we assume the minimum as some large number and every time we see an entry, if it is smaller than the minimum we reduce it	train
audio_0_120575.wav	So, This is the reverse saturation current density, to calculate the current we just need to multiply this by the area	train
audio_0_208098.wav	The center of the arc is not somewhere inside the object somewhere outside	train
audio_0_34744.wav	If we are doing it in one pass and we are checking if numbers divide both m and n, then why not we just directly check for common factors	train
audio_0_200789.wav	So now let me draw a box around this circuit	train
audio_0_60717.wav	since this color is not ok, let me write different color: x, y and z	train
audio_0_1808.wav	We know if since N1 / N2 = V1 / V2 therefore, V2 = V1 * N2 / N1 right = V1 is giveN2500 and N2 / N1 is 1 /10	train
audio_0_12146.wav	So, if you come here what will be your v c infinity right	train
audio_0_36203.wav	So, our first step is to remove this from the queue and explore its neighbors	train
audio_0_72023.wav	so means you are a designer, you want to fabricate, so the entire cost of fabrication have to be borne by you	train
audio_0_32555.wav	Now this is a bit confusing, so join is a function which is associated with a string	train
audio_0_77795.wav	In the previous case we have seen that 10% of sales are on cash and 90% on credit	train
audio_0_215306.wav	So, let me just brief you about another example	train
audio_0_104272.wav	So now we have an expression that comes from the failure criterion for motor and using equilibrium and compatibility an expression for the motor and now an expression for the unit itself coming from the consideration of the linear failure surface in tension compression of the brick unit itself	train
audio_0_15664.wav	Another thing is i x this is a common node v 1 and this is your also common node v 3 right	train
audio_0_170680.wav	We can move our eyes in different directions to suggest whether we have understood it or not	train
audio_0_128430.wav	So we mix the cement with water	train
audio_0_38748.wav	Because this transistor is on; so you will get a 0 at this point, so at the pin you are getting a 0	train
audio_0_65087.wav	but you see, in this design there is a problem with respect to power consumption	train
audio_0_48394.wav	You notice that the contribution from node 2 was 0 so; similarly you will find that the contribution from interior nodes becomes 0 ok	train
audio_0_82398.wav	This increase in the cost because of any reason is if you look at this increase in the cost is amount at any given volume of output by which aggregate costs are changed if the volume of output is increased or decreased by even one unit	train
audio_0_177801.wav	Now, let us first understand the modeling of mechanical systems	train
audio_0_6093.wav	So, i is 1 1 square R into 8 actually it is 8 watt	train
audio_0_154069.wav	All parameters are given it is we converted to volt per meter	train
audio_0_180663.wav	So, I also have told you how to remember the circuit, you just have to remember this one and then for non inverting amplifier; that means, this input this will be, this will go to 0	train
audio_0_45341.wav	So, you ignore this term also and for the phase term you write rho is approximately equal to R into we can use the binomial expansion over here and you will get a	train
audio_0_158949.wav	Assets you can see are more or less same	train
audio_0_191303.wav	I hope you understand what I mean by phase sequence	train
audio_0_105576.wav	So, remember this terms, if you see this circuit we have taken the circuit from electronic tutorials we have if you see here there is a signal V s, right	train
audio_0_11935.wav	And one current i c is going like this, although i c is equal to ah minus thing	train
audio_0_39779.wav	So, let us let see what we can do with this	train
audio_0_107338.wav	So, non inverting amplifier gain we know gain is nothing, but A equal to 1 by R f by R I right	train
audio_0_62792.wav	physical buffering means you introduce some buffers, or virtual buffering means you indicate that here you may require a buffer, but you do not introduce right away, you may need to introduce later	train
audio_0_200226.wav	If I rewrite it differently in terms of the reactants 1 by Omega C2 the reactants of the capacitor must be much smaller than the resistance across it which is RD plus RL	train
audio_0_73169.wav	it is difficult and some variation in the parameter during fabrication can deviate this zero skew characteristics in an actual tree design, right	train
audio_0_185611.wav	One is aerodynamic damping	train

audio_0_131059.wav	If you talk about slag again you have something very similar to fly ash and if you have talk about silica fume actually the lower band is there is noÖthe resistivity is much higher compared to fly ash or slag	train
audio_0_42025.wav	So, here the variable of interest, is the scattered field ok	train
audio_0_33466.wav	Now, if you do this you see we get back to exactly the input files as it is without the extra blank lines because print is no longer creating these extra lines	train
audio_0_16166.wav	Because 400 by 50 it will be 8 ohm plus 5 is equal to 30 ohm	train
audio_0_59103.wav	instead of t i am going to substitute t minus x over v and v	train
audio_0_127804.wav	Now before we go on to looking at life cycle assessment let’s look quickly at why it is necessary to assess sustainability and why do we have to give so much importance	train

audio_0_15046.wav	Now, we know that n S is equal to 120 f by P	train
audio_0_4649.wav	So; that means, at omega greater than omega 0 B C greater than B L that is theta Y that is positive right and angle of impedance theta will be negative	train
audio_0_63058.wav	so let see that how it looks like here, the same example i am showing here	train
audio_0_66465.wav	so even if he transistors are off, non conducting due to some see, the junctions can be modulus, some reverse bias diodes which are [vocalized noise] not conducting, there can be drain junction leakage, sub threshold current	train
audio_0_216874.wav	i am sure ah you might have seen that in the newspapers as well that you know all these ah voice based command systems are quite popular, right	train

audio_0_198728.wav	That is the reason why you would see clearly may be initially, it may be somewhat linear but as it gets to larger and larger currents the saturation effect is much more pronounced because of which I am not going to see any increase in flux at all after sometime, but I would see a pronounced drop in the flux due to the demagnetizing effect, whereas magnetizing effect is really not going to be all that visible (18:51)	train
audio_0_186484.wav	People is the most crucial element among the services mix	train
audio_0_35028.wav	Whereas, in Python it will just happily go ahead and create a new value for that name and pretend that there are two names now while you think there is only one and create all sorts of unpredictable errors in your later code	train
audio_0_133968.wav	By computing an addition of C1 and C2 possibly what we wanted to do is to wrap around because you go beyond the three constant 0, 1 and 2 that you had and we probably would have like to wrap around so that if you are adding 1 to 2 it should actually become 0 that is it should on increment come here and keep on going like that, but because the addition has taken me to integer, I have a result 3, there is no corresponding enum constant for that in my type definition	train
audio_0_19917.wav	So we are sacrificing that material to protect our hull of the ship	train
audio_0_212143.wav	So, we are at point number 5, where we have drawn a 45 degree line, this is 45 degree line from point F, and already we have located V F equal to V B	train
audio_0_213783.wav	We do not know complete information about surface which we are intended or interested to construct	train

audio_0_169047.wav	In his book Digital Body Language, Steven Woods is the co founder and Chief Technology officer at Eloqua	train
audio_0_20800.wav	Next would probably be either him continuing with what is already writing or him having to look back or check as to what he had written earlier relevant to that particular topic that was taught in class	train
audio_0_185709.wav	Since, we have a closed path through the external circuit, some current will flow in the direction of the EMF	train
audio_0_166759.wav	Now let's see what are the durations for which the different inversions can occur and the tasks due to which the different inversions can occur	train
audio_0_39224.wav	So, whatever if you if you looking to this diagram like here; so, we said that SMOD equal to 0; it is 64 and SMOD equal to 1, it is 32 similarly here SMOD equal to 0 is 32 and SMOD equal to 1 is the clock is divided by 16	train
audio_0_34433.wav	So, it returns it in the form which is not exactly transparent, but it says that i is of class int	train
audio_0_209547.wav	So, right is projected to left	train
audio_0_151668.wav	This will be the your train right because you have connected if i C 4 is 0 it will remain as it is; that means, this i C current actually flowing like this flowing like this flowing like this throughout the source	train
audio_0_105011.wav	This is my metal; metal I am just showing you the schematic do not worry we will we will come back to the process flow where you will see step in detail just look at the schematic	train

audio_0_171815.wav	You have to just simply put the value of v naught is equal to 0 in this case	train
audio_0_177588.wav	It means that both of them will be short circuited	train
audio_0_11036.wav	So, this way this is the sinusoidal EMF generated	train
audio_0_54460.wav	Till now we had been discussing on the non isolated converters like the buck boost and the buck boost converters	train
audio_0_43808.wav	But, if I wanted to if my information that if my question was where are the eyes I can still answer the question if my question is how many whiskers are there, I cannot answer this question right	train
audio_0_138189.wav	So, if I say there is an array of int, then everything in that all value in that array has to be int	train
audio_0_134404.wav	In cases, you cannot because of you want to mean something different or you want to mix up certain types and do some conversion, you will have to use the explicit instantiation	train
audio_0_204815.wav	This entire incline portion, we are about to see it something like a projected rectangle	train
audio_0_135290.wav	If I does not belong then the control comes here, then you put it that is add it to the list so this is what	train
audio_0_150847.wav	So, all these things one has to your, one has to your, understand here had not much mathematics here only little bit theory an understanding	train
audio_0_48495.wav	Order n right; so, compare this with MoM which is order n cube that is why this is fast	train

audio_0_118719.wav	So, Now, we have a p type semiconductor and we do this by adding acceptors N A and this must be greater than the donor concentration n d	train
audio_0_20519.wav	So that is a positive aspect because he understanding and connecting what he is already learned with what is learning right now, so	train
audio_0_203762.wav	We have already worked out the expressions for GM, KN, the current factor, times VGS minus VT or square root of 2 times KN times the drain current	train
audio_0_197443.wav	So, I have to essentially derive point by point and then I should be able to basically get so, this was my second point, this was my third point, may be my external characteristics will be somewhat like this, and finally it may end up under short circuit condition, if I just short circuit the load terminals, voltage will be 0, if the voltage is 0, that means I am not getting any terminal voltage at all	train
audio_0_2128.wav	So, if it is slip is one at that time it is E two, but when that rotor is running it has some slip	train
audio_0_15913.wav	Throughout the text or throughout this course we will follow the passive sign convention	train
audio_0_184235.wav	Now, the unknown resistance R X will be connected between these two terminals	train
audio_0_137190.wav	The type is int	train
audio_0_141097.wav	But even then the compiler gets confused and will tell you that the default parameter for parameter three has been redefined, it was already defined and it is being defined again and this will not be allowed	train
audio_0_65953.wav	suppose i have a gate like this: output of this is going to another gate	train
audio_0_40409.wav	Since its vacuum, it is very simple its related by epsilon naught and mu naught not at all difficult	train
audio_0_19104.wav	So the other way round solution can be applied here and can I instead of heating the environment which is what the air conditioning will do, can you think of lower cost ways to do it	train
audio_0_38775.wav	So, if you put a 1 here at the input pin, then when you are doing this operation that is reading the pin	train
audio_0_158573.wav	In the assets, we are already seeing the major examples of assets	train
audio_0_212471.wav	Now, draw X 2, Y 2 again parallel to this project all this line to X 1, Y 1 which we will get a line view and now, draw another XY X 2, Y 2 plane parallel to this line view and project whatever the new view we got it	train
audio_0_215813.wav	It yes you can, but your time would be a way lot more than a team working together and also the effort that they are putting it, because you would be a one standpoint for creation of everything	train
audio_0_153346.wav	Because the lagging current your this current is lagging, this this current is lagging because of the lagging current of the large motor a start	train
audio_0_166467.wav	And these are very small programs run for a few microseconds, just few lines of code and incur very less runtime overhead	train
audio_0_124032.wav	So, this is an inductor having a normalised impedance zl	train
audio_0_19557.wav	So, one way of empathy could be you yourself going through that experience and figuring out, oh	train
audio_0_192256.wav	Because how much of control my leg can have, foot can have in terms of how much of pressing I am doing, it is kind of difficult	train
audio_0_134305.wav	So, if we change that order this will be basically change	train
audio_0_52450.wav	So, I am not going to derive this, but I will just give you information	train
audio_0_124320.wav	So the microstrip line consist of a ground plane with a top layer metal with a sub strip comprising of some Dielectric like Teflon or glass epoxy or ceramic in between	train
audio_0_44216.wav	The order of a	train
audio_0_44610.wav	So, it is just and it is straight forward	train
audio_0_48656.wav	So, just think of it like that yeah direct delta is a input and g is the response of the system to it ok, it is that function which satisfies this equation right	train
audio_0_619.wav	So, we will not study um generating mode, we will not study breaking mode also only this part	train
audio_0_175683.wav	So, in this class we will continue our discussion on the Thevenin's theorem but we will discuss more about the dependent sources that may be the voltage or current	train
audio_0_49189.wav	So, in order to use this Green’s function over here I should have another equation of the form what	train
audio_0_12942.wav	That means any any angle theta can be written as e to the power j theta, right	train
audio_0_185493.wav	Do we know V N not directly, but we know something about V N	train
audio_0_117142.wav	Now this duration could be anywhere say from 1 week, few days or even a month and what we assume here is that this during this epoch period we have extensively tested the entire design so that no hardware Trojans get triggered within this a particular epoch period	train
audio_0_36174.wav	When the queue is empty, there have been no new squares added which are unmarked before they were added	train
audio_0_155655.wav	1 degree, but it is your what you call it is lagging angle right ah and ah and if you talk of a compute V 4; V 4 is equal to V 3 minus I 3 Z 3	train
audio_0_46532.wav	So, if it for example, if it is 0 to begin with it will continue to be 0, this has nothing to do with FDTD, this what Maxwell’s equation that telling me right	train
audio_0_215705.wav	Now, in that if you have to go to one step and change it, life is be very very miserable	train

audio_0_170927.wav	When another person touches us in a professional setting, it validates a positive feeling in most of the situations	train
audio_0_37465.wav	Nobody accept them as scientific because the same English or whatever languages being used by people who were nonscientific spiritual gurus of chaos	train
audio_0_79406.wav	Kyrlosker is the one, general electrical is the one, many private sector companies have come up in the field	train
audio_0_191374.wav	If the two voltages match exactly there is no way, the bulbs can glow right but it is very difficult rather impossible for me to get the exact matching like that because I may think that it is 50 hertz actually grid frequency may be 49	train
audio_0_2876.wav	So, in this case, your Req is equal to 49 by 4 that is 7 by 2 ohm right I didn't written for that, but it is 7 by 2 ohm	train
audio_0_127444.wav	So the original idea was Ok	train
audio_0_212063.wav	So, we have already located point V on that curve	train
audio_0_73039.wav	so lets say wvdd, this weight, this weight of this line is eight and w and out is ten, w and in is three and ground is also three	train
audio_0_151888.wav	So, this is actually your x 2 this is x 2	train
audio_0_6221.wav	So, from case here that is ah ah that is i 1 is equal to i 2 i 2 plus i 3, this is equation we will substitute there in this equation, right	train
audio_0_113381.wav	Let us take one more example; if you are given a circuit where R=3	train
audio_0_149643.wav	How, whether it is a socially celebrated, socially acceptable model of behavior which will help you attain the goal or any how you attain the goal and nobody will care what means was adopted to attain that goal	train
audio_0_176636.wav	Now, although the unit impulse function is not physically realizable similar to what we have seen in the case of ideal sources like ideal voltage source and ideal current source	train
audio_0_129115.wav	Now of course beyond all this there is a much more deleterious reaction which is a progressive loss of stability of C S H, now C S H you know very well is the adhesive phase inside your cement	train
audio_0_35730.wav	As we said before python interprets init as a constructor, so when we call a object like p equal to 0	train
audio_0_4035.wav	So, it , basically, it is sees the voltage	train
audio_0_134610.wav	So, we have included the string class as in the header	train
audio_0_163741.wav	We have seen how to do horizontal analysis by preparing a comparative statement where we compare the current figures with last year	train
audio_0_52305.wav	But you can see that there is something in the volume which is being summed over right	train
audio_0_54543.wav	So you have minus V not appearing across the inductor into 1 minus DTS	train
audio_0_63580.wav	you can say the delay estimate, like, like the interconnection delays, the gate delays or the cell delays and so on	train
audio_0_40486.wav	So, it is all comes together very nicely alright	train
audio_0_101558.wav	So that's why M into a, mass into acceleration is being brought in	train
audio_0_130446.wav	So when you have class C fly ash in system, the expansion was less compared to the plane system	train
audio_0_92891.wav	40 into 3	train
audio_0_216992.wav	ok, so this is the temperature i am just visually putting it down and there is a band that you have associated	train
audio_0_191333.wav	So that is the reason why it is generally automated but what we do in the laboratory generally is done manually	train
audio_0_44850.wav	So, this should be true at all x,y right, and you notice that this k i dot r this is going to have terms like k i x x plus k i y y and these phasors are rotating in whatever in phase space and this expression should be true always	train
audio_0_37473.wav	So, this time psychiatry and psychology are under tremendous pressure	train
audio_0_17216.wav	It is a short; nothing here it is a short right	train
audio_0_14641.wav	Now, in the direction of the flux for this winding for this winding i 1 plus i 2 entering, so it direction of the flux that if you put there it is it is actually going like this, this is phi 1 and in this case now in this case what is happening, that current is leaving the dot right as the current is leaving the dot that in the direction of the current if I wrap it the way on the left hand side, right hand side, if I wrap or grabs the coil like this the direction of flux is upward that is why phi 2 is upward	train
audio_0_78883.wav	The fixed cost is say expected to be 180,000 in case of the supervision was expected to be same for 7, 8 and 9 million level of the revenue	train
audio_0_64382.wav	just for the sake of example, if suppose my work size is five, first bit indicates fault free	train
audio_0_33728.wav	This initializes the board; what how do we print a board well for every row we sort the rows	train
audio_0_71240.wav	so there will be a partition like this	train
audio_0_170444.wav	In general we can say that the pause should never be accidental it should always be a part of careful planning in a professional dialogue	train
audio_0_179345.wav	Instantaneous power it will be definitely a product of instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current	train
audio_0_148458.wav	So, 7 comparisons are required	train
audio_0_117872.wav	In this particular lecture what we will look at is a new form of attack known as the Return to Libc Attack	train
audio_0_144312.wav	The right to copy in itself is not an end because why do you make these copies the copies are largely made to exploit for profit	train
audio_0_32365.wav	If it has two children we have a hole we have a leaf we have a node which we have to remove value, but we have values on both sides below it and now we will use this maximum function maxval or minval in order to do the work	train
audio_0_51284.wav	So, if I have a edge let us say over here this is not going to involve the edges far away those all going to be 0 we have seen that right	train
audio_0_209270.wav	Flip that rotate these things at suitable locations, fold, unfolding kind of thing, then we will have this complete picture on three3rd angle projection	train
audio_0_44848.wav	These are phasors that are rotating	train

audio_0_49714.wav	And they also had terms like time derivative, so there is a derivative in space and there is a derivative in time; and so the simplest thing you can do is to find out what is the relative weight of these two derivatives	train
audio_0_103913.wav	And that is this point O	train
audio_0_68863.wav	so after doing this cut, you divide	train

audio_0_11161.wav	So, suppose this is Polarity Test	train
audio_0_38950.wav	5 we have got two ways to do this masking one is D I, E I another is by using the SIM instruction, so we know that there is the individual flip flop for enabling disabling of these RST s, so they can be utilized is in the SIM instruction and D I, E I will be affecting the interrupt enable flag so as a result entire thing will be disabled, trap cannot be masked so this is the only non Maskable interrupt that 8085 has	train
audio_0_194688.wav	So this is split ring A now which is connected to B2 previously B was connected to B2 and A was connected to B1 now B is connected to B1 and B2 is connected to A	train

audio_0_153389.wav	For examples ferroresonance in transformers, subsynchronous resonance is the more pronounced right during motor starting, shutting of motors during normal operation, and difficulty in protection of capacitors; series capacitor of course from system fault current; series capacitors do not have large application in distribution system	train
audio_0_156199.wav	Then we try to store it and if we have successfully stored it then whenever needed we will like to retrieve it	train
audio_0_20369.wav	So, he went to great detail and detailing what their environment might look like, so, this is a kind of detail he wanted students also to do in a real life, and this is a great case study for them	train
audio_0_33960.wav	If so, then we remove it, this we can either write self dot next is equal to self dot next dot next or we could even just write self dot next is equal to none which is probably a cleaner way of saying it because it can only happen at the last node	train
audio_0_194819.wav	This is the load right this very clearly tells me that there are 4 parallel paths in the current If I may call this as I by 4 this is I by 4 this is another I by 4 and this is I by 4 and the total current drawn here is I	train
audio_0_86466.wav	So, you can get those things fabricated which is not a big deal trust me, or you can get a coarse one and then you can gold plate it and you know make it sharper, and several things you can do there a lot of zone for innovation tremendous zone for innovation what you can work through	train
audio_0_53506.wav	Otherwise all other ratings will be according to the bug boost waveforms	train

audio_0_159171.wav	So, you get the total of current assets and then total assets, which is total of NCA plus CA	train
audio_0_120545.wav	So, we can substitute the numbers	train
audio_0_134739.wav	First we need to decide on the data type of the element, define a structure or container, for actually defining that in C we will need to use some maximum size, otherwise the C compiler is not allow us to define it, declare a top variable which will maintain the top of the stack and then we will need to write the four functions that are typically required for the operations of that stack	train
audio_0_205527.wav	Even if we make it a small variation in terms of fixing it like mechanical stresses perhaps might twisted	train
audio_0_110417.wav	Thus, we can realistically assume that voltage at the non inverting terminal of the op amp is equal to the voltage at the inverting terminal	train
audio_0_157608.wav	What happens in the case of a exemplars okay, these are once again the best example that would come to your mind	train
audio_0_51742.wav	So, just; so, one last thing I’d like to draw your attention to is that there are two different parts of this magnetic field, one has a 1 by r dependence and the other has a 1 by r square difference	train
audio_0_210394.wav	These drafters can be of different types also;, the simple drafter which we call mini drafter is shown here	train
audio_0_18469.wav	So I think time factor is a question here again	train

audio_0_1985.wav	For example, if F is equal to frequency is 50 hertz and P is equal to say 4 pole machine, that P is equal to 4 no question of pair only poles	train
audio_0_84038.wav	And here is the problem uhhh we have small problem and we will evaluate the cost to uhhh the cost to this particular company	train
audio_0_113513.wav	See again let us see this condition	train
audio_0_104411.wav	So for the uncracked portion of the wall, for the uncracked portion of the wall, the total eccentricity is the eccentricity of the load plus the deflected, the deflection at that section	train
audio_0_125448.wav	Using a simple if you just write a program in Matlab, you can easily find out using nerical methods the value of omega R	train
audio_0_201909.wav	So, this is known as AC coupling and the way we connect RL to the transistor is exactly the same as our original common source amplifier we connected through a capacitor	train
audio_0_211482.wav	Unless we make a cut section remove this first part and show something like, where sheet metal can be represented by a thick line; that indicates that material might be present within that red portion and the white portion, there is no material	train
audio_0_153654.wav	you square equation sixty three and sixty four and you add it	train
audio_0_155318.wav	Ah	train
audio_0_175558.wav	So, first thing which we have to understand is that how we can convert the various circuit elements from time domain into s domain	train
audio_0_206785.wav	So, that is the reason we show it in parenthesis	train
audio_0_215769.wav	So, we undertake this agile method of developing products, instead of a waterfall design this is always much more better; life is way more simpler	train
audio_0_207253.wav	Similarly, the other end of the line also projected suitably connect these projections; that is the way we will be in a position to join the projections onto different planes	train
audio_0_15842.wav	Therefore, this your in general a voltage drop from 1 to 2 is equivalent to the voltage rise from 2 to 1 meaning is same	train
audio_0_19908.wav	That is using a sacrificial material which would take on the brunt of all the corrosion and still protect the material from marine life So we needed that desired result for these two	train
audio_0_45448.wav	So, let us just write down some notation over here	train
audio_0_2034.wav	Rotor is not moving n is equal to 0	train
audio_0_107103.wav	You can see a set of wafer loaded into the furnace	train
audio_0_59597.wav	the solution earlier obtained showed you in proper limit because you have distance while solving a this, what you know, there may be some radially current through the voltammeter	train
audio_0_18131.wav	These caves are 2200 years old at least as I have already mentioned	train
audio_0_194595.wav	So you can imagine basically that if I am going to have the magnetic pole like this I am going to have the magnetic pole extending only until the machine ends after that wherever I have a conductor the conductor is going to bent like this and then come back like this this overhang portion becomes useless	train
audio_0_125038.wav	And gamma 1 is the mismatch between this beginning sections z0 & z1	train
audio_0_71648.wav	we have seen some methods or techniques which can be use at the level of gates, or at the so called atrial level design	train
audio_0_32834.wav	So, this tells us that when the program continues this is the assumption	train
audio_0_196018.wav	So when I have want to come to minus 10 ampere, now this current that I am pumping in, will create an extrinsic flux which is definitely in the opposite direction, but it has to do some work on these magnetic domains and realign them	train
audio_0_48507.wav	So, this is a I mean unwanted reflection	train
audio_0_6057.wav	Now, second case is, it is I hope I am not marking it by pen I think it is simple think	train
audio_0_87152.wav	Then we talked about storage of the cylinder at specific location where the cylinders have to be ensured that those cylinders are properly hooked with chains or clamps	train
audio_0_44805.wav	We had called it back then we had called them parallel polarization and perpendicular polarization depending on whether the electric field vectors in the plane or perpendicular to the plane right	train
audio_0_172378.wav	So what we can do, we create one super node which includes V 1 and V 2 and we will apply KCL for this super node	train
audio_0_35475.wav	So, when we do memoization when we come back and recursively explore it will never ask us to come here because it will never pass these boundaries	train
audio_0_85324.wav	So, it means now how much is the total amount available	train
audio_0_161335.wav	So, total NCL is 2328	train
audio_0_47167.wav	So, what I am plotting is the value of this objective function s minus G s U x	train
audio_0_210080.wav	Once that is done, we can convert this rectangle which 50 dimensions, again we have	train
audio_0_199973.wav	So, how do we go about realizing this	train
audio_0_131477.wav	So that is the end of that part, thank you	train
audio_0_49697.wav	So, everyone is let us go back to our weak form over here right further still yeah here is the weak form right	train
audio_0_213973.wav	So, up to 20 mm we would like to have this thread and 1	train
audio_0_130989.wav	At this point you take you open the specimen or autopsy the specimen and determining the amount of chloride at the steel surface	train
audio_0_50020.wav	So, the z axis any point any line parallel to the z axis is tangential to the surface	train
audio_0_46566.wav	So, what if I take now think of extending this there are going to be four adjacent grids, four Yee cells right what should I do	train
audio_0_212773.wav	So, if we are looking at carefully, the machine gear where these teeth will be joining with the other teeth let us look at that part	train
audio_0_177578.wav	Now since these two elements are in parallel, so you can take the parallel combination of these two elements and you can find out the impedance	train
audio_0_184236.wav	So, this is R X and now let us call R internal equal to total internal resistance of the circuit total internal resistance of the circuit ok	train
audio_0_74698.wav	First one is the say quantity number of units we want to sell in the market and second is the price at which we want to sell in the market	train
audio_0_176365.wav	For t less than 0 this switch is open, so we found that the initial current which is flowing through inductor is 4 ampere	train
audio_0_191525.wav	So, I will say VA, another voltage source probably	train
audio_0_137120.wav	And we will see there are several programming situations, there are several problems for which having such a static data member would really help	train
audio_0_72297.wav	so, sub broad approaches we are talking about now one by one	train
audio_0_42200.wav	So, supposing this is your computational domain right	train
audio_0_176324.wav	251 A2	train
audio_0_100908.wav	The first correction factor, so that's what the stress strain curve would look like	train
audio_0_49776.wav	So, the mid frequency range has wave like solutions ok	train
audio_0_170279.wav	As we have already seen ray Birdwhistle had developed the studies of kinesics and Edward T	train
audio_0_56266.wav	so you can see immediately that a dot d s is indeed l cubed and that confirms this divergence theorem	train
audio_0_85647.wav	One thing which was required that is the actual price per kg of the input that was not available so we have found it out	train
audio_0_46231.wav	Because, there is magnetic current is on the is a pure surface current it does not it is not either here nor there is exactly on the boundary right	train
audio_0_100502.wav	So, this is what we have seen so far	train
audio_0_121251.wav	So, let me include that as well and draw a schematic of the laser structure	train
audio_0_186539.wav	So today we will look at healthcare services and other professional services	train
audio_0_79808.wav	In this case because the performance has changed budgeted was 3,000 80,000 actually is 4 lakhs	train
audio_0_158674.wav	Now, let us go to the next part that is liability	train
audio_0_172426.wav	There would be some phase difference	train
audio_0_163658.wav	This is a simple ratio, current assets divided by current liabilities	train
audio_0_164440.wav	So, we were here working capital turnover ratio which is sales upon working capital	train
audio_0_101512.wav	So, if you primarily remove the axial load, the axial stresses due to the self weight and any superimposed load from these expressions you should be able to get the loads corresponding to horizontal bending and crack formation under horizontal bending	train
audio_0_205226.wav	So, we have that hollow cylinder	train
audio_0_134258.wav	So, the algorithm is same in respective of which overload which we use, but since C++ is strongly typed for every version, we need to have a separate code we need to have a separate version of code which will work the code for int will not work for double and so on	train
audio_0_111615.wav	Wwhen I when I ask him to press power button, he will press it	train
audio_0_55448.wav	Apart from with these values and this will give you a feel for what you what to expect in a real circuit on the oscilloscope	train
audio_0_11980.wav	So, if you put tau is equal to C R, so C by tau is equal to C by C R; C, C cancel, it will be 1 upon R that is why V s upon R e to the power minus t by tau right	train
audio_0_39835.wav	So, if I take d psi by d r that is what I want to worry about d psi by d r psi is any function, I can write it by chain rule as d psi by d x d x by d r right	train
audio_0_34438.wav	The point to keep in mind is that the name is themselves do not have fixed types they are not assigned types in advance	train
audio_0_199251.wav	That is, V 0 is smaller than what is required, what is desired	train
audio_0_181364.wav	Now, through the voltmeter as well which was not flowing previously through these previously when the voltmeter was not there	train
audio_0_184685.wav	Observe the moment I have inserted this ammeter in this circuit this voltmeter is not measuring the voltage across this resistance	train
audio_0_12036.wav	So, now look the example, so in in ah figure this is 41, the switch has been in a position a for long time thism that means, if you look into the circuit that, this is this was in this position for long time at position A, this is A right	train
audio_0_95066.wav	So, that's why we must know the present value	train
audio_0_144319.wav	For instance a person publishes the book when he publishes a book he becomes the copyright owner of the book by a mere act of adding the copyright claim on his book he just puts the copyright symbol which is a small c within a circle © and writes his name the authors name and followed its by the year in which he writes the book	train
audio_0_171393.wav	In order to understand what exactly is the emotion which is being conveyed, we have to look at accompanying kinesicbehavior	train
audio_0_11306.wav	So, in that case your what you call this is the current flowing your through this is I 1 and current suppose if load is connected, this is I 2 and this if you take in this direction, current will be I 1 minus I 2, but I have taken in this direction	train
audio_0_149822.wav	So, case study has all those advantages	train
audio_0_106240.wav	So, if you can come back to the screen,I will show it to you how it looks like	train
audio_0_104965.wav	Because the idea is to pattern the metal	train
audio_0_183991.wav	It is going to be interesting, it is going to be very interesting	train
audio_0_68220.wav	now, at every stage we check whether any line from the set l s, whether the intersect l, t or naught	train
audio_0_178381.wav	In next session we will discuss the case where we have dependent voltage or dependent current source is also available in the circuit	train
audio_0_74068.wav	Historical cost is the one is the actual cost which has already happened and it can be used as the guiding factor or the base level factor	train
audio_0_76350.wav	In the upper case, in the labor rate of pay variance, rate went inside the bracket and that actual time came outside the bracket	train
audio_0_209953.wav	So, when a line is inclined to both vertical plane, horizontal plane, we have to use this kind of projections to construct this front view and top view of the system	train
audio_0_211178.wav	We will see here this mate selections has a window, small window we have to click on that and select the faces we want to do we want to mate	train
audio_0_131182.wav	Welcome you all for the lab session of bond characteristics of prestressing strand	train
audio_0_86071.wav	Now interestingly So, the embryonic day starts from say E0 to say E22 when sorry, this is actually not calling run it is called fetal	train
audio_0_14165.wav	65 volt right	train
audio_0_155570.wav	Then what will be the effective load here	train
audio_0_124868.wav	So, to do that we have our S212 as 1 upon omega 6	train
audio_0_14236.wav	So, 1 upon I f 2 is equal to 46 upon 30, but I f 2 is equal to 250 upon R plus 250 right	train
audio_0_16222.wav	I mean what i did i bring this point bring this point here right; that means, 40 and 50 in parallel because no other electrical element is here	train
audio_0_169028.wav	For example, if we maintain a positive body language, then gradually our emotions would have a positive shift	train
audio_0_142659.wav	Then the limited disclosure of the main result with that is the what of the technology can do the work rather than disclosing how the technology works, the details of how it works	train
audio_0_169069.wav	There are certain reservations about its applicability particularly in those organisations, which are focused on learning and related with development of human beings	train
audio_0_172486.wav	So therefore the reading which we get from watt meter W 2 will be 0	train
audio_0_51246.wav	So, that will be the strategy that we will solve	train
audio_0_144650.wav	The mission of an IP centre could typically be something like this to serve and assist researchers in the transfer of institutions research results to industry for commercial application, consumer development and public benefit	train
audio_0_57587.wav	so energy flow out will be s, dot d s	train
audio_0_171331.wav	Then it sometimes works as a good strategy you can use a pen or a pointer an gradually bring this in front of the eyes of that person, gradually you would find that the eyes of that person are focused on this pen and gradually this pen can be brought to the point which you want to illustrate	train
audio_0_64597.wav	the remaining two, seventy degree, you are not propagating the waveform	train
audio_0_47153.wav	So, what we are assuming U constant	train
audio_0_45597.wav	So, your discretization is 30 centimeters say by 10 3 centimeters or even smaller than that let us say a 1 centimeter	train
audio_0_179720.wav	So, that is why if you see here, it between CD the polarity of E is of minus is on the top and plus is on the bottom	train
audio_0_53669.wav	Now what is the duty ratio	train
audio_0_65067.wav	so here the clock will be coming to the flip flop only for those instances where the applied d value and the output q stored value are different	train
audio_0_111291.wav	The fourth point is better functional performance	train
audio_0_49443.wav	Sorry, I wrote the whole thing again let us write this	train
audio_0_132713.wav	So, you are actually doing something which is kind of illegal and goes against the basic premise of const ness that you have built up	train
audio_0_72964.wav	so in the final position, the total force exerted on the block b four will be equal to zero	train
audio_0_86263.wav	so now, once it bounces back, you can track it by having a position sensitive device or some kind of a device here which will see at what angle this laser is bouncing back	train
audio_0_212602.wav	Similarly, you would like to write some text on your drawing sheet	train

audio_0_124898.wav	This is a lowpass prototype where the pie orÉ In this case we have pie equivalent	train
audio_0_173445.wav	Eigenvectors are used to make the linear transformation understandable that means the eigenvectors if you stretch and compress the vector on XY plane than the direction of the vector in XY plane is not going to change	train
audio_0_43833.wav	We have seen that minimum when we go back over here minimum l 1 meant sparse	train
audio_0_86243.wav	another question is how you really develop these kind of structures	train
audio_0_67014.wav	let me go back to that rapper diagram here	train
audio_0_147029.wav	Later, you again turn on the heater, again heater will take some time for the coil to become hot	train
audio_0_65413.wav	ok, this is what we refer to as the upstream gates	train
audio_0_131988.wav	First of all, it has given funding to enable us find out lot of these mechanisms	train
audio_0_214827.wav	Before we continue any further, let us see what is not E learning	train
audio_0_39809.wav	It is called a Hankel function	train
audio_0_194882.wav	So, to actually give the flux value directly, rather than that I can say normally d phi by dt is voltage, this we know, N times d phi by dt, maybe let me write that like that	train
audio_0_59331.wav	the area across which it is going is the y z plane	train
audio_0_212014.wav	In principle, there are four methods available Focus Directrix method, second one is Concentric circle method, third one is Oblong method, and fourth one is Arc of circle method	train
audio_0_191238.wav	We call it as infinite bus because the voltage and the frequency of this grid are kind of set and stoned	train
audio_0_103326.wav	We saw the arches and even tall structures are possible because of this good compressive strength of the material itself	train
audio_0_100779.wav	The wall is limited by the tension reinforcement, the FS that you have used as the permissible tensile stress in the steel and you can complete your analysis and the final value of A is estimated and you can use that in your calculations and it should work out to be the one that you are seeing on the screen and N is the modular ratio that you have been using in your previous calculations as well	train
audio_0_198362.wav	Then we also talked about one more which is actually a permanent magnet machine or permanent magnet rotor	train
audio_0_193995.wav	If I just look at them you know superficially so I may have definitely some slots and so on and so forth where the windings are inserted but by and large if I look at the air gap the air gap is completely uniform throughout the circumference	train
audio_0_203351.wav	So if we do that, we have to draw the incremental equivalent of this	train
audio_0_70832.wav	if you can see that i have shown two standard cell placements, this is so called bad placement and this is so called good placements	train
audio_0_62205.wav	but with this s, when we saw that e is zero for an electric field, that means any path i go around, work done is going to be zero in taking the charge around	train
audio_0_171936.wav	It will come from some other source like initially applied and now is continuing	train
audio_0_193937.wav	So, we do have let us say we are going to talk mainly about doubly excited machine in this course mostly that is the reason why I took an example with two excitations from stator site as well as rotor site and under a static condition I should be able to say id lambda that is what we call as the field energy	train
audio_0_112905.wav	I have the source rotation facility which is which we can use using Programming	train
audio_0_134643.wav	So, first thing that gets called is the first name string then the second name string and then the construction of the name object	train
audio_0_41882.wav	So, let us see under what conditions does that happen	train
audio_0_144109.wav	Now, normally you would expect the disclosure to be made, in what is called an invention disclosure form or IDF for short	train
audio_0_10393.wav	So, it is system is constant	train
audio_0_114604.wav	Now we could actually look at the value of x and rightly enough the value of x will be zero	train
audio_0_16325.wav	Initially I have written for you	train
audio_0_86956.wav	So, and as a matter of fact when I floated this course there are people has been that that is a practical training how really want to you know put a cross a course which is mostly a practical training people have cell culture labs	train
audio_0_164396.wav	Again in absence of market price we don't know but this is an important ratio which links market prices to book value	train
audio_0_91368.wav	And once the plan is over, the project starts off and then we have the project execution where the project manager concentrates on how the project progresses as per the plan	train
audio_0_146634.wav	It can also check your breath; you can exhale on top of it	train
audio_0_50526.wav	So, what am I doing	train
audio_0_11332.wav	So, in this case ; so, in this case your K dash is equal to V 1 upon V 2 is equal to N 1 upon N 2 that is greater than 1	train
audio_0_63672.wav	now, if there is a timing violation, then we have to go for physical synthesis, restructuring, where we modify the netlist so that the actual arrival time can be reduced, so that this slack value can be again made zero or positive	train
audio_0_4396.wav	So, admittance are added for parallel branches, for branches in series impedance are added and for branches in parallel right admittance are added right	train
audio_0_170855.wav	They were trying to model behavioural patterns to obtain excellence	train
audio_0_109151.wav	This is the probe that we connect to the oscilloscope	train
audio_0_177093.wav	So what we can observe, we can observe that inductors which are connected in parallel are combined in the same manner as the resistors in parallel	train
audio_0_44748.wav	I have a charge what is the field around it q by 4 by epsilon r square those kind of things	train
audio_0_150444.wav	Very easily you can slot people into different categories and then you know who would be better if centered this very position in this capacity in the organization	train
audio_0_61538.wav	this is going to be t cosine of theta one and this component, t sin of theta one, and therefore the net vertical force is t sin theta to minus t sin theta one, and the amplitude of very small i can roughly writ it as t theta two minus t theta one and the horizontally component, this t minus t, which is zero	train
audio_0_49648.wav	There is a set of global convention there are set of local convention then a 1 to 1 mapping over here	train
audio_0_119830.wav	So, when the light is switched off, the concentration of the minority carriers essentially decrease	train
audio_0_110963.wav	You can see now, still it is still not allowing to pass	train
audio_0_179594.wav	How will decompose	train
audio_0_46606.wav	Yeah, because there is only E z it also there	train
audio_0_20696.wav	So that’s a conflict to be addressed which is what our next would be	train
audio_0_145791.wav	So, therefore if you write this particular quantity d square si by d phi square with some value m square si is equal to 0 because we know that this kind of equation this is a positive value because it's 2 i e by h bar square and the particle having any kinetic energy in a circular motion obviously has a positive energy moment of inertia i is positive h bar square h bar is positive therefore this is a positive quantity and this of course has a solution si is equal to a e to the i m f plus b e to the minus i m f	train
audio_0_79845.wav	So, proportionately now if we go for the expenses, so you can say the sales variance is positive but the expense variances will become negative because the raw material requirement for the 7 lakh worth of the sales was less it has gone up at the level of the 8 lakh rupees or dollars worth of sales so the variance will be negative but ultimately we are not going to achieve any objective it is the only wastage of the resources time and money so major limitation of the static budget And on the basis of that means whatever the information is available with us, we prepare the performance report and performance report basically is a generic term that usually means a comparison of the actual results with some budgets	train
audio_0_217127.wav	so you have a two stage opamp circuit	train
audio_0_171970.wav	When the circuit when the switched is off at time t is equal to 0 the current that is I naught just before the switch off of the circuit or just after the switch off phenomena in the circuit	train
audio_0_185011.wav	Now suppose you all have seen maybe in your lab ammeters which has multiple range which has say multiplied terminals and depending on the range of current that you want to measure you connect the wires all across the suitable terminals or it may have some knob with which you can change the range of measurement, how is that done	train
audio_0_206319.wav	The horizontal line P3 on generate at 3; so this is the line where it is going to intersect extend it so that we are going to make another point P3	train
audio_0_136296.wav	There is no way that the language does not give you any mechanism, any operator to do anything with the reference	train
audio_0_33088.wav	So, you just get the values you do not get that positions	train
audio_0_198831.wav	So, in star delta starting, normally we assume that the motor stator winding is connected in delta, so this is the motor winding okay	train
audio_0_64992.wav	just compare these two bits and that result can be sent to the output directly without involving this n minus one bit comparator	train
audio_0_34597.wav	So, if we ask for the value of y at this point it is 5 as we expect	train
audio_0_139058.wav	So, if we try to quickly look at the output then for this code, the output will look like this	train
audio_0_146772.wav	Now, in the loop phase, what we are doing	train
audio_0_68684.wav	now if you calculate the weighted sum of this signal probabilities and the sum of the bit changes across transitions, like you see, two, between one, one and zero, zero, two bits change and what is the total probability	train
audio_0_183204.wav	On the other hand, in this circuit which was originally an inverting amplifier when we change the plus minus sign; this behaves like a non inverting Schmitt trigger which means output also increases, if input increases	train
audio_0_193658.wav	But how are we really going to quantify it	train
audio_0_206516.wav	Now, similarly I would like to draw something like a Line	train
audio_0_46366.wav	Bisect it ok, but then it is still not unit you are saying break up the triangles into 2 right angled triangles and do the integration of each other,, but remember the your you then you also have to rotate your triangles because right now your co ordinate axis are what your triangles are not aligned with the co ordinate axis like the green triangle right this is your x and y	train
audio_0_118350.wav	Let us say you have a free electron or an electron in free space and you apply in electric field E, electric field usually goes from positive to negative	train
audio_0_10318.wav	Similarly, for V BN, and similarly for V CN right	train
audio_0_163316.wav	Now, current ratio, you know it is current assets divided by current liabilities	train
audio_0_56530.wav	so i'll erase this small r, replace this by capital r, remove this small r, replace this by capital r, remove this small r and replace this by capital r, because we are doing it at radius capital r and i add the two, so the net flux is going to be: since d r is infinitesimal, i can write this exponential as: e raise to minus lambda r times e raise to minus lambda d r	train
audio_0_68075.wav	ok, so to summarize, false path aware analysis is important and this is quite well under understood	train
audio_0_216949.wav	there is an optics right, and then there is a cmos or a c, c, d, ah, charge coupled device based ah sensor which is capturing the image and then you have essentially ah image data	train
audio_0_40089.wav	So, even though I have written just r, it is understood that when you see r it is actually r with vector on top, but it makes the whole thing very clumsy	train
audio_0_214599.wav	Also it is important to acknowledge this diversity when we say that we are designing using a learner centred approach	train
audio_0_11192.wav	So, this is the Ammeter is connected 1 Wattmeter is connected and 1 Voltmeter is here	train
audio_0_46292.wav	So, today so now we will look at the final aspect of the 2D FEM edge based FEM, where we will look at some of the numerical aspects that go into calculating the matrix elements	train
audio_0_127206.wav	Then I chose a point minus J 1	train
audio_0_36508.wav	The second point to note is that a value can be a single item	train
audio_0_194927.wav	So I am getting a measure of flux, I am not saying it is exactly flux per unit area, flux per whatever unit turn, I am not saying that at all	train
audio_0_79253.wav	So, it means we have to see here that how the prices are being changed	train
audio_0_41179.wav	So, that is one mistake that you could do if you did not do this integral carefully ok	train
audio_0_101864.wav	We are not looking at a situation where the confined masonry construction is an alternative to that type of reinforced masonry but minimally reinforced masonry with reinforced concrete bands and vertical bars and RC frame construction as well	train
audio_0_59023.wav	so we are talking about something like the ten raise, fifteen, ten raise, ten, ten raise to fourteen	train
audio_0_103574.wav	In a real problem, you would actually have to then also take into account what the actual stiffness is to arrive at the relative stiffnesses also	train
audio_0_42743.wav	So, this is dl in this case	train
audio_0_106527.wav	That means, we will heat this wafer on hot at 1200C for 1 minute	train
audio_0_204220.wav	One easy way to do it is you have a mass voltage controlled current source and follow that with a MOS current controlled voltage source	train
audio_0_207166.wav	To see that, let us just make this transparent	train
audio_0_207540.wav	Similarly, if we by making this equal division, that means, we will be in a position to really draw such kind of normals for this major axis circle	train
audio_0_44130.wav	So, for example, the curl of H right; so, let us expand it out	train
audio_0_64831.wav	it will be upper bounded by one plus epsilon	train
audio_0_36645.wav	Now the positions determine the names so they do not have to be used in the same order	train
audio_0_152861.wav	91 degree, right	train
audio_0_117154.wav	So this memory location we can assume is non volatile and what we could actually do is that when the power is restarted the first thing the counter would so is to restart from the stored value this way potentially the attacker could cost the counter to count 2 value which is greater than the epoch time	train
audio_0_15886.wav	So, this one look at this one this is a simple circuit element say something it is say it is something	train

audio_0_215079.wav	To help learners effectively assimilate content, construct their own understanding; make their own meaning, learners need to engage in articulation and reflection	train
audio_0_130669.wav	But anyway I think there are two things that we have to do	train
audio_0_110689.wav	Now, the principle characteristic of band pass filter or any filter for that matter is its ability to pass frequencies relatively, un attenuated relatively, un attenuated over a specific band or spread of frequency called pass band and attenuate the other band of frequency called stop band, we have seen this	train
audio_0_212184.wav	For example, if we are taking any gear mechanisms like watch to have the synchronization motion, we have a spring	train

audio_0_211888.wav	In today's class, we will learn about how to construct a hyperbola	train
audio_0_91744.wav	Here, data is coming from outside application boundary in external input	train
audio_0_215523.wav	Whenever we see that for example, in the first screen we have a blue button for back and in the second screen we have a green button for black, it just breaks the consistency of the learner and they are confused about even the shape had changed because from circle it has become a square, the position has changed from the bottom left to top right	train

audio_0_186545.wav	Introduction of internet introduced a new era in the electronic commerce	train
audio_0_200949.wav	But if tomorrow someone else invents a device which is different, you should still be able to work with them	train
audio_0_38990.wav	These devices that we are considering they are most of the time they are mechanical device or electro mechanical devices and many a times they involve human being like; say, there is a keyboard if i connect keyboard to the microprocessor then when the user is pressing a key may be the interrupt is given in the processer that the key that a key has been pressed	train
audio_0_193987.wav	So, this is due to the mutual inductance that is coming up between the stator and the rotor and the interaction between the stator and rotor currents	train
audio_0_129598.wav	So perhaps the foremost technique for following the hydration reaction is isothermal calorimetry	train
audio_0_114942.wav	So, we recollect that, in the Linux systems the randomize va space would take 3 values 0, 1 or 2	train
audio_0_172330.wav	So the first task, what we have to do is that we have to convert this particular circuit into frequency domain	train
audio_0_115573.wav	Now whenever there is a malloc that gets requested what happens first is that the ptmalloc code would pass through this particular link list and determining whether there is a free chunk of memory that it can satisfy the request for malloc	train
audio_0_107732.wav	I am there to help you out	train
audio_0_64731.wav	what we need is a tree is a spanning tree	train

audio_0_77673.wav	One case I have discussed finished in the previous class	train
audio_0_51789.wav	So, brute force is a bad idea	train
audio_0_68862.wav	now, in this case it is one, two, three, four, five lines are cutting, so cut size is five	train
audio_0_52273.wav	And then phi minus phi i is equal to whole bunch of terms over here	train
audio_0_147451.wav	Now, these four can be mutually conflicting; if you pull one, the others will be pulled in the reverse direction, means if you want to improve one maybe the others might get degraded	train
audio_0_54881.wav	So it is like this	train
audio_0_121529.wav	We bias this in such a way, n is connected to negative and p is connected to positive	train
audio_0_80153.wav	But when the actual and the standard time is different and if the standard is revised also, you are using the third and the fourth formula	train
audio_0_102927.wav	So if we were to work on the concept of homogenization, and that assumption of an isotropic homogeneous material is, if it were completely acceptable for a material like motored masonry, then you could simply work with principal stresses and when the principal stresses reach some of the material strengths, you have a failure criteria	train
audio_0_182129.wav	So, springs now wants to stop this coil but, due to inertia the coil will go up to some distance	train
audio_0_137700.wav	It may have typically garbage values	train
audio_0_69184.wav	because we are not giving equal importance to the x and y, both the directions	train
audio_0_66839.wav	so in the last lecture we talked about the design for distribute technique	train
audio_0_33431.wav	So, s is equal to line colon minus 1, will take the line and the strip of the last character which is typically backslash n that we get, when we do readlines	train
audio_0_40290.wav	So, in step 1 I made r belong to v 2 in step 2 I make r belong to v 1 because that is my region of interest	train
audio_0_120589.wav	This is why we essentially call a p n junction to be a rectifier because it conducts very well during forward bias and the reverse biased current is very small	train
audio_0_80771.wav	So, generation company generates the power and that gives to the central grid or the marketing company who is known as the transmission company	train
audio_0_7983.wav	Right, how to solve it	train
audio_0_150782.wav	So, different type of your what you call lightning arrester so, that were that is beyond the scope for this course	train
audio_0_171309.wav	I would suggest that one should focus automatically more on the person who has asked the question, but while they are answering they should also maintain an equal eye contact with the rest of the team members also	train
audio_0_41005.wav	So, one of the simplifying assumptions will be we’ll take our current source to be let us say along the z axis, but very thin will make the wire to be very thin ok	train
audio_0_36668.wav	This whole thing, this part of it comes from the format	train
audio_0_192713.wav	So I have different methods	train
audio_0_141181.wav	So that is basic difficulty of what we are saying as issue one	train
audio_0_181269.wav	So, instead of writing it as in terms of current, I can also write this position as 1 volt	train
audio_0_16671.wav	So, we will put Z bar a complex number is equal to you can write either V m by I m this one or is equal to you can write V m by root 2 divided by I m by root 2	train
audio_0_37840.wav	Because if you tell pa ask parents that ok, how were you at 14, they it is a blank	train
audio_0_52294.wav	Volume	train
audio_0_1046.wav	So, that it is customary to refer to this voltage as the back emf	train
audio_0_14979.wav	2 this is I 1 into the power factor 0	train
audio_0_128350.wav	What is what are the number of nearest neighbors of each particles	train
audio_0_180682.wav	So, therefore, I erase these unnecessary things and connect this directly to the ground, this is inverting amplifier	train
audio_0_122862.wav	E is also related to the potential by the expression E dvdx, which means the potential V is ∫ E d x	train
audio_0_4318.wav	So, m l then this is your mean side this is your load side C and V sometimes you write like this , but at the resistance in very high	train
audio_0_35765.wav	Here is way we would do it; we would create a new point whose x coordinate is self dot x plus p dot x	train
audio_0_184073.wav	So, then maybe these resistance says this contact resistances which will come in picture in series with this resistance that will be different	train
audio_0_46486.wav	Then that its boundary	train
audio_0_92884.wav	This is the what only one cost driver is there, we are multiplying this	train
audio_0_51384.wav	Well I just create in this in this green shaded region I introduce loss in the epsilon r mu r of those triangle	train
audio_0_19237.wav	What I understand is that writing has to be writing in its purest form and then maybe digital and all that can come later, okay I hear you	train
audio_0_107988.wav	And if you want to calculate, or if you want to understand what was the equation of the output voltage, right	train
audio_0_74838.wav	In the telecom sector we have seen that earlier it was dot department of telecommunication	train
audio_0_114360.wav	So, while it is easy to understand that n that is the number of stages in ring oscillator upends the frequency, the delay of each inverter that is t actually depends upon the fabrication process of these gates	train
audio_0_168235.wav	Whether the time we keep in our communication is monochrome or polychrome or whether during our dialogues and conversations we are using different aspects related with our understanding of time	train
audio_0_207594.wav	3, similarly at 4, also intersect this point	train
audio_0_153241.wav	So, it is ah 3 by 160; so, it is 160 by 3 hertz per megawatt right	train
audio_0_180221.wav	So, this is called a Dual Slope Voltmeter	train
audio_0_17232.wav	Now, second thing is, the steady state a long time, after the switch closes, means the capacitor acts like open circuit right	train
audio_0_42407.wav	So, it is a more cumbersome, but we can take	train
audio_0_145858.wav	Until then thank you	train
audio_0_200232.wav	So, VD by VGS equals minus GM times RD times RD times RL plus 1 over j omega c2 divided by the sum of everything r d plus rl plus 1 by j omega c2 okay now previously we had only rL in the numerator for VO be greater than the output voltage magnitude	train
audio_0_196672.wav	So, unless I have some amount of access available the machine is not going to accelerate	train
audio_0_107263.wav	So, we see there is one RC here there is one RC over here and there is a amplifier stage correct	train
audio_0_59490.wav	then voltage across two om will be two i one	train
audio_0_40608.wav	So, you build it into the solution, you do not have to do something extra to get this property yeah ok	train
audio_0_64144.wav	now, as i said, this is one of the most widely used technique	train
audio_0_10350.wav	Suppose, you have a suppose you have a we have seen already I have made it for you before right, this is a star connected load right, this is a star connected load	train
audio_0_85708.wav	This is the difference of how many	train
audio_0_152394.wav	So, it will just 17	train
audio_0_105736.wav	So, this is your capacitor	train
audio_0_198283.wav	So whenever I am having a machine rated for say 1500 rpm means it will work as a motor with rated voltage, drawing rated current, delivering rated torque at rated speed	train
audio_0_39662.wav	So, delta x by c is going to be a very small value right, but that is not exactly the right way to think of it	train
audio_0_141471.wav	What is the need for moving the data member here, because earlier see if we just add an employee class and let us say we allow engineer to specialize for that and have the name here then certainly there will be no issue as you go to the manager and director and so on	train
audio_0_198128.wav	Now because I have this I should be able to say at the given torque if I want to get different values of speed I should be able to get different values of speed either by adjusting the voltage or by adjusting the armature resistance or by adjusting the flux value	train
audio_0_216725.wav	this can be typically a delivery annotation and this is a message annotation	train
audio_0_104302.wav	So the joint thicknesses are what alpha prime is standing for, the ratio of the joint thicknesses	train
audio_0_112613.wav	So, after etching SiO2, I will dip this wafer in acetone right acetone because acetone is PR steeper	train
audio_0_79148.wav	So, cash budget tells us about the cash position of the firm and the balance sheet tells about the overall financial position of the firm	train
audio_0_58137.wav	let us also write d s prime	train
audio_0_108517.wav	Can you see anything in that this one	train
audio_0_178585.wav	Now another way to obtain the line current is that you replace the delta connected source into its equivalent star connected or Y connected source	train
audio_0_110170.wav	So, what it says is that, when the once the resonance condition occurs, right the xXll will be equal to xXc	train
audio_0_56345.wav	so just like charge density consisted of a small, small or the charge is distributed in space, polarization density consists of let me remove this black line so that they don't disturb us this consists of small point dipoles distributed in space very close together	train
audio_0_76706.wav	So this schedule is ready	train
audio_0_164753.wav	O, I or F	train

audio_0_110081.wav	Hi, welcome to this particular module and this is a lecture series where that we are looking at oscillator’s right	train
audio_0_18548.wav	Or continuous evaluation system, you can bring this into the continuous evaluation system, so the best contributor are based on what how much you are contributing to this because you are essentially ensuring that everyone in class is learning out of this content	train
audio_0_64413.wav	ok, so how were simulating many faults together by having m z m o in all the lines	train
audio_0_1408.wav	Now, you apply KCL at this thing, then this current actually entering this i 3, right and this 3 I current also coming here this 2 are entering plus 3 I is equal to your what you call i 2, right	train
audio_0_105993.wav	Now frequency is given as Fc here	train
audio_0_154118.wav	013 meter and V 0 is this one	train
audio_0_111214.wav	But what to do with this	train
audio_0_44821.wav	Let us call it k i dot r ok, and E naught in this case is going to be a vector in the x y plane right because its E x E y right	train
audio_0_132991.wav	If I want to use the data, then I need to write it in this form	train

audio_0_212486.wav	So, based on our steps, we can sense that this line we have to pick for constructing any auxiliary planes and views because that is the true line what we can get	train
audio_0_43859.wav	So, I called it one variable x instead of having to write something minus 1 and so x right so, right	train
audio_0_81518.wav	Before you prepare the real profit and loss account at the end of the time horizon, these days we don't prepare only monthly financial statements, sorry, annual financial statements	train
audio_0_179454.wav	And then we will shift by t and finally for different value for t we will now multiply the two functions and then integrate to determine the area of overlapping reasons	train
audio_0_43676.wav	This works in you know sort of reasonably small size problems the MATLAB syntax is very simple a slash b right that is what we achieve a solution	train
audio_0_19738.wav	Lots of users we detailed out	train
audio_0_113471.wav	So, when VGS is increased below greater than particular voltage my current I D is sufficient to for when my VGS is greater than particular voltage, th what will happen	train
audio_0_16359.wav	So, R Thevenin is equal to basically your V Thevenin by i SC, you will get the your what you call that Norton resistance same philosophy right	train
audio_0_163720.wav	So, company has to seek a balance between fair amount of equity and debt	train
audio_0_210790.wav	First thing we have to project this point onto vertical plane the vertical plane is this one, let us call this one this is horizontal plane	train
audio_0_71276.wav	we have a set of points these are the clock terminals we try to find out our matching, for which the sum of the total, some of the edges, is minimum	train
audio_0_129511.wav	First looking at the emissions the carbon dioxide emissions we find that for 1 kilogram of concrete there is an emission of about 0	train
audio_0_5417.wav	So, if it is so then suppose a circuit is given where we have got V Thevenin and R Thevenin right and a load resistance is connected, this symbol is a variable symbol right, then i L is equal to i L is equal to your V Thevenin by R Thevenin plus R L right	train
audio_0_132718.wav	Of course, do not try this with c style casting, because it will become very dangerous	train
audio_0_78202.wav	So now if there is some key or limiting factor, you have to use that limiting factor or key factor in a way that production of those products will be maximum by using that power for 18 hours whose PV ratio is the comparatively higher as compared to the other ones	train

audio_0_16455.wav	V is equal to v 1 plus v 2 plus v k plus v n right this is your what you call that voltage v this is the supply voltage v right	train
audio_0_106140.wav	Then class 2 we have seen the substrates	train
audio_0_113835.wav	So for example this was run on an Intel i7 machine which had an L1 cache with 64 cache sets, so each column over here corresponds to a particular cache set	train
audio_0_77689.wav	JIT is basically a material management technique which is the firms use to reduce the cost of inventory or the cost of storage of inventory as well as overall cost of inventory	train
audio_0_215162.wav	There are of course, advantages to using segmenting your lessons	train
audio_0_69018.wav	so earlier the gate delays were much larger so you could afford to ignore the interconnection delay, but you cannot right	train
audio_0_110476.wav	001; then what will happen	train
audio_0_126729.wav	Now beyond 30 GHz, the wavelength is in millimetre	train

audio_0_215955.wav	There could be multiple and varied reasons for why she was unable to answer her friends questions	train
audio_0_68711.wav	ok, these are all architectural, or algorithmic level, you can say, or higher level design techniques	train
audio_0_214754.wav	You may have come up with various approaches such as short videos and practice questions, active discussion forums, frequent interactions with instructors, immediate feedback and additional learning resources	train
audio_0_31493.wav	For example, supposing we try to create a list and by mistake we use a semicolon instead of a comma	train
audio_0_93160.wav	So, that's why they are ignoring this	train
audio_0_148800.wav	Having understood perception to a greater extent, we are now moving to our second concept that we would we trying to discuss at length and that is Learning	train
audio_0_34032.wav	One of the most common things we do when we use the internet is to type queries and look for matching documents or other resources on the internet	train

audio_0_14677.wav	And in the frequency domain, I told you earlier d by d t, you replace by j omega right if you do	train
audio_0_54277.wav	So it will be located in that place	train
audio_0_64356.wav	here what you saying is that with every line we associate two vectors: m z and m o	train
audio_0_101149.wav	The first stage is called condition assessment	train
audio_0_147596.wav	And, on this side you can see a black kind of a thing; there is an arrangement that is an opto coupler circuit, which I shall be telling you about	train
audio_0_41341.wav	So, some places as I mentioned before will have a e to the minus j omega t convention in that case the effective permittivity will have a positive imaginary part ok	train
audio_0_214035.wav	So, we have the spiral curve where we can really give height up to 6 mm	train

audio_0_162278.wav	So that profit is also shown in P&L	train
audio_0_74166.wav	You reduce the human resources, you think about those fixed costs which can be controlled or which can be eliminated and seriously look at the variable cost because it is very easy to eliminate and minimize the variable cost	train
audio_0_128857.wav	It was not a problem beforehand because that patch was corroding so much it was kind of protecting the outside	train
audio_0_67325.wav	they can be small, they can be big, they can be square, they can be rectangular	train

audio_0_165081.wav	They meet only once a year and that is where they review the conduct of the board	train
audio_0_69915.wav	so so in this case we assume that the resistance value is two point five kilo ohm micrometer for gates resistivity	train
audio_0_117879.wav	Now the LibC contains implementations of all the standard rather a large number of the standard C function cause that we are typically used to for example string copy, printf, scanf, fopen, fclose, string cat and so on are all present in LibC so there are easily over thousand functions that are implemented in LibC	train
audio_0_99020.wav	So, when you are estimating seismic weight, care is to be given to calculating the seismic weight because what we are implying in this model is that the seismic weight of the structure is lumped at the floor level	train
audio_0_50345.wav	So, that you know that I am going to do it to all of these equations ok	train
audio_0_185244.wav	No, it is not	train
audio_0_44577.wav	So, that is the price you get for a sparse system of equations there has to be there is no free lunch and that is why you lose out	train
audio_0_78378.wav	For example here is now another thing is that export credit	train
audio_0_150831.wav	If you go to any substation you will find this lightning arresters are there, and you will say once you visit this apparently from the distance, it will go you go to go and see all these things like lightning arresters, then CT that is current transformer, then potential transformers how the current transformers are connected, then the insulators, then the transformer circuit breakers each and everything and one can learn	train
audio_0_183413.wav	5 into 1	train

audio_0_127715.wav	So, when we applied 150 or so kilo Coulombs, we see that we were getting to a situation where we were starting to stop the corrosion	train
audio_0_113031.wav	Uniformity of the photoresist is another thing	train
audio_0_163785.wav	Or maybe I will keep one year figures	train
audio_0_96005.wav	You can do the calibration to previous experience	train
audio_0_163033.wav	Other things I think are simple to you	train
audio_0_83943.wav	So value of the opening stock has come down by 20,000 and value of the closing stock has come down by the 45,000s and now the variable cost of production we have calculated is the 16,080,625 into this we are adding up 450,000 rupees of the variable selling cost because what is the selling cost here	train

audio_0_107418.wav	If for example, 8 pin dual inline package, what is this size of this pin	train
audio_0_122374.wav	And then doing the math, we get n i to be 0	train
audio_0_105439.wav	So, the point was that, in the starting of the this particular filters lecture, I told you that the filters are generally used or most widely used in the communication circuits in the communication or systems alright ok	train
audio_0_148806.wav	So, we have our experience coming to us and those experience which makes us learn to the extent that certain degree of stable change come to us	train
audio_0_43983.wav	This is ok, this is one thing another optional thing can be which is very powerful is visualizing the output ok	train
audio_0_74785.wav	Then you talk about certain things like value chain	train
audio_0_127508.wav	But in most cases, a 100 milli volt depolarization is majority used	train
audio_0_65434.wav	when the downstream capacitance is large, buffering can be better than cloning	train
audio_0_40227.wav	So, what will the value of this function be	train
audio_0_76353.wav	In case of the labor efficiency variance now we will have to apply the formula	train
audio_0_79921.wav	Then we have to do a detailed analysis in terms of converting into percentages or maybe the absolute values	train
audio_0_150005.wav	Now imagine a situation you acquire proficiency in a particular language, you are exposed to another language at certain this stage in your life, you decide to learn a third language and there are certain specific linguistic skills that are needed to develop competence in that very area and you realize that few people do it nicely	train
audio_0_202254.wav	S to RL	train
audio_0_92109.wav	As I was saying that over the century many techniques have got developed	train
audio_0_125131.wav	And if we do not have more than 2 non touching loops, then our delta term will end here	train
audio_0_125258.wav	So, again suppose it take a cross sectional view of my coaxial cable and say if I have have my outer conductor just at this level, this point, then there will be a lot of fringing fields and this will cause the quality of the open termination to degrade	train
audio_0_109473.wav	So, until now we have seen what are the oscillators	train
audio_0_50791.wav	So, that takes us to normal boundary conditions and I will use	train
audio_0_190714.wav	Because anyway it is not going to affect, this is not going to affect the armature current or armature power factor	train
audio_0_131187.wav	In case of pretension concrete system you need to transfer the stress from the strand to the concrete, to transfer the stress from the strand to the concrete you need to have transmission lengths from both ends	train
audio_0_68963.wav	you use some kind of a bottom up approach	train
audio_0_39930.wav	So, you can say switching in general ok	train
audio_0_46504.wav	So, what is the first thing I have to do	train
audio_0_18483.wav	How would you qualify	train
audio_0_47788.wav	Is equal to	train
audio_0_66418.wav	so you see, in a dynamics c mos dynamics logic we are not using many transistors in the pull up	train
audio_0_105614.wav	For ideal operational amplifier we know, right there are golden rules the golden rule is that no current flows into the input terminals, no current flows into the input terminals, right	train
audio_0_115477.wav	It uses gilibc and hence the malloc would invoke a function which is present in ptmalloc2	train
audio_0_214123.wav	So, this circle will be bounded by these lines and this point matches there and this point matches there; this is on the top side, this is on the bottom side	train
audio_0_104157.wav	So, recent works have looked at bringing in construction detailing to limit infill damage	train
audio_0_175858.wav	Where we discussed about the voltage and current sources and we also saw what are the various symbols of dependent as well as independent voltage and current sources	train
audio_0_190346.wav	So I am going to call this portion as energy or field energy which is Wf and I am going to call this portion as co energy or Wf dash	train
audio_0_59369.wav	form the bulb	train
audio_0_164882.wav	Now, daters are going down means these are the balances with customers they have paid us	train
audio_0_83278.wav	So after 30s when we had the financial accounting we had the cost accounting businesses again started coming back on the wheels	train
audio_0_48758.wav	So, basis function so it is characterized by set of basis function	train
audio_0_143865.wav	Now, again this was meant not as a trademark, but it was meant as a means for a craftsman to tell the world that a product belongs to him or he was the creator of the product	train
audio_0_132887.wav	Where is the x coming from, B does not have x, but B is a A has an x	train
audio_0_123828.wav	So it acts as an inductor	train
audio_0_160515.wav	So, we have taken these slides from that	train
audio_0_208055.wav	If we have hole and other things, we usually go with this dash dot kind of things or a circle with holes also we will be in a portion to show this dash dot lines	train
audio_0_78437.wav	The threshold level can be brought down from the 1	train
audio_0_181831.wav	So, now, it will copy the same value as long as enable is equal to 1	train
audio_0_139568.wav	So, in the comments, you can see that actually if I specify 0, 2 as the first point, then I am actually specifying r being the name of the rectangle r dot t l is a top left point dot x is x coordinate of that which gets the value 0	train
audio_0_123848.wav	If we do a coordinate transformation where we write X is equal to L d then this becomes so then now if you take out this E raise to +2gamaL then this Vo upon Vo+ is converted to VL upon VL+	train
audio_0_208382.wav	This might be the front view top view	train
audio_0_34426.wav	So, if you type the word type and put an expression and either a name or an expression in the bracket, it will tell you actually type of the expression	train
audio_0_16565.wav	The after thus after the switch closes the charge on the equivalent capacitance is, when switch is closed the charge on the equivalent capacitance is it will be q 1 it will be q 1 plus q 2 that is also 100 micro coulomb right	train
audio_0_11437.wav	9 and 4 hour, at no load	train
audio_0_115232.wav	Then, there is a prepare resolver and finally the jump to PLT 0	train
audio_0_184567.wav	So, we can say that virtual shorting is working, it is true	train
audio_0_43993.wav	Numerical convergence is something that you have to do any way, but it may be that you have converged numerically to the wrong answer; I mean you have coded a consistent set of equations which are wrong like let us say you forgot the k naught squared term altogether	train
audio_0_13477.wav	Or this this equation also can be written I mean if you want that it will be your minus 10 plus ah your 5 i 1 plus v 0, and v 0 is equal to actually and v 0 actually it is current entering into this i 1 plus 10 entering the positive terminal	train
audio_0_48079.wav	Its the displacement of the string at any position x ok	train
audio_0_53568.wav	Turns in the secondary gauge of the wire, so on	train
audio_0_8656.wav	Therefore, if it is dc voltage, so I will be is equal to 0 that means, when the voltage across the capacitor is not changing in time the current through the capacitor is 0 right	train
audio_0_205017.wav	For example, here we have a semi circular arc	train
audio_0_208530.wav	So, the arrow direction represents we are going to retain this part and we are going to remove this part	train
audio_0_147785.wav	In this lecture, firstly I will be interfacing with the STM board a Bluetooth module	train
audio_0_177532.wav	So, your modified circuit will now be as shown in the figure	train
audio_0_45930.wav	Its not be content they will be more in which	train

audio_0_39975.wav	So, those are all sorts of complications	train
audio_0_116043.wav	You can check this, so like p/x okay, so this is the address of glob and now if you continue executing what you see is that we have got an invalid malicious output	train
audio_0_128804.wav	And if they make a decision to use a system, they it comes to the market	train
audio_0_173550.wav	So therefore, the state variable model which we have just discussed is more general than the single input, single output model which we generally see in case of the transfer function	train
audio_0_208734.wav	For example, this surface I can not visualize it on that plane	train
audio_0_70308.wav	these are more like some adopt checks, an optimizations	train
audio_0_81903.wav	And if it is reaching at h then only the action will be taken or if it is reaches at the over the minimum level then the action will also be taken	train
audio_0_36488.wav	But python has a shortcut which says that you want to count from the right then we count the numbers as minus 1, minus 2 and so on	train
audio_0_102661.wav	Now, you can define what is a nominal strength of the material which is the value, rn, denoted here as rn	train
audio_0_12265.wav	And this will be your current source; arrow is upwards right, and because here plus polarity is here and this will be your 4 ampere right	train
audio_0_1803.wav	So, first thing is that N1 / N2 = 10 is to 1, 10 / 1 = 10	train

audio_0_101716.wav	Lap splicing is again something that you will have to take care of because reinforcement is going to go in the vertical direction all the way through the road bearing walls	train
audio_0_15019.wav	That is why this has to be you have to be when we solve their solve the numerical this has to be subtracted from this one right	train
audio_0_62928.wav	right, so some placement may need to be change significantly	train
audio_0_102960.wav	That's basically what's been done with altering ratios of sigma 1 and sigma 2 in the orthogonal direction with different signs as well	train
audio_0_141588.wav	So, here I include this member function which I will invoke from my call method	train
audio_0_135895.wav	So, that is a basic difference between static and dynamic binding of course, I am just trying to introduce the semantics to you	train
audio_0_126376.wav	Now after passing through this amplifier, we will get outputs like this	train
audio_0_171247.wav	Another example is that Eskimos and the Chinese do not have a word their culture for anxiety	train
audio_0_61554.wav	so this one example how wave equation is obtain in a system and that automatically gives you the speed of wave	train
audio_0_119813.wav	So, this expression is got from the original expression for conductivity; conductivity is ne μe + p e μh; conductivity sigma is related to the resistivity as 1/ρ, and r is nothing but ρl/A	train
audio_0_155503.wav	It so; that means, whatever whatever value you take Tp Kr Tr Tt Tg ultimately it will give you the same statistic value whatever you got, but if you are K p and are changes naturally the steady state value our function of K p and R	train
audio_0_215500.wav	Moving next I have taken a small example from a mobile device because that is again relevant thing where we actually access e learning content or electronic content	train

audio_0_15098.wav	Therefore, in the problem it is given how much resistance must be included per phase	train
audio_0_84816.wav	So, desired ending inventory, for example, you want to keep 100 units at the end of the month which will be used the next month	train
audio_0_134542.wav	So, we will string duplicate Partha into the str field and keep its length in the len field and then we can print	train
audio_0_80534.wav	If you calculate the operating income, so how it will be calculated	train
audio_0_137744.wav	So for a built in type, the lifetime basically spans from the point of definition to the end of scope	train
audio_0_104430.wav	This complication can be overcome if we assume that the curvature profile is uniform throughout the cross section but the fact is this is still conservative this is still conservative an estimate conservative with respect to the exact solution of the problem itself so if we were to assume the curvature along the height being constant, then the double integration becomes simpler	train
audio_0_64385.wav	in this table we are showing the corresponding m z and m o values which we fix up at the beginning of the simulation	train
audio_0_150774.wav	So, basically it is a breakdown voltage at the surge frequency to the breakdown voltage at normal system frequency, this is that called impulse ratio	train
audio_0_196574.wav	And you cannot even say, the current carried by the armature is going to get reflected on to the field not at all not at all	train
audio_0_198790.wav	Initially, you will have some residual magnetism, it will produce a small voltage, that voltage will circulate a current through the field	train
audio_0_199396.wav	Now another alternative which you would have seen in some activity questions or I even discussed it in one of the earlier lessons, is to have a voltage source	train
audio_0_137820.wav	So, all static objects get constructed before main starts	train
audio_0_216638.wav	you can you different types of sensors for different applications	train

audio_0_7357.wav	5 micro farad that is 0	train
audio_0_147343.wav	In the setup phase we use mySerial	train
audio_0_4132.wav	So, in this case , you are what you call , that you find out your first I a i b and I c you find out	train
audio_0_182503.wav	So, I will say that in an op amp from it is static characteristic you just absorb that the output of an op amp can take 3 different values	train
audio_0_185557.wav	The forces, I should better write torque, because we are talking about angular displacement	train
audio_0_35590.wav	We saw a skeleton implementation of a heap	train
audio_0_109602.wav	And because of its sound similar to popcorn popping, it is also called popcorn noise; it is also called popcorn noise	train

audio_0_144720.wav	It does not have any office within the institute, it is completely managed by the third parties	train
audio_0_42681.wav	So, this is remains as before over here ok	train
audio_0_185189.wav	So that means, the internal resistance of so, the internal resistance of this circuit as seen from the terminal A B that is R n should be much higher than the ammeter internal resistance of the ammeter, then only our reading will be close to the correct value	train
audio_0_13469.wav	So, here also now you have to apply KVL in loop one	train
audio_0_180360.wav	So, the net effect will be that, there will be a current which will flow in this direction along the direction of the stronger EMF	train
audio_0_97924.wav	So, these are closely spaced rafters that you would normally see	train
audio_0_106068.wav	So, suppose you are given this figure	train
audio_0_69219.wav	so, while computing the edges or adding the edges, we are ignoring the free space wherever there is	train
audio_0_20461.wav	Online, offline reference materials	train
audio_0_134793.wav	Then you see that we are identifying if some the corrected that is given in the expression is operand or not	train
audio_0_64704.wav	lets assume that there are n number of sink nodes, s one to s n	train
audio_0_215870.wav	Let us begin with a reflection spot	train
audio_0_141158.wav	We want to add a real with a complex	train
audio_0_267.wav	So, you have to simplify by using a 3 terminal equivalent network right generally we will consider 3 terminals equivalent network for example, your this thing just hold on for this one	train

audio_0_199862.wav	Now, we will look at how to do incremental analysis when we have nonlinear two port elements in a circuit	train
audio_0_126132.wav	Then if we connect resistance Rb in series at the output or conductance 1 upon Ra in shunt at the input then again we can get or we can shift the positions of this stability circles, so that they become like this	train
audio_0_201175.wav	So, what I have done is to replace this with the small signal incremental equivalent of moss in saturation region, because in saturation region we have the characteristics which are desirable to make a good high gain amplifier	train
audio_0_178171.wav	Now, let's see few of the properties of Laplace transform	train

audio_0_79585.wav	Standard time was double 2	train
audio_0_76396.wav	And then unskilled was 8 we have paid 10 and here also we have paid 2 rupees extra so it means this all has caused the total labor cost variance to be negative though the efficiency has compensated to some extent but since the price paid was very high or there was a difference in the price paid actual price as against the standard and number of man evers are also very high 200	train
audio_0_122826.wav	So, once again Vo represents the barrier that the electrons have to overcome in order to go from the n to the p side	train
audio_0_56853.wav	At 1, 2, 3, 4 fluid leaving would have that component in the x direction and therefore, fluid leaving the volume the box through 1, 2, 3, 4 is going to be equal to the component of v in the x direction coming out of the volume times b c again	train
audio_0_214707.wav	They are a different kinds of relative advantages of technology that may be considered	train

audio_0_147374.wav	The code has been dumped	train
audio_0_164703.wav	Where will dividend received go	train
audio_0_203195.wav	And to get the total solution here, what we do is we sum the operating point quantities which are these and the incremental quantities from here	train
audio_0_35690.wav	So, you may remember or you may have seen somewhere in high school mathematics that if you take the point x, y then an alternative way of representing where this point is to actually use polar coordinates	train
audio_0_190323.wav	And we also took one more maybe rod kind of structure which will be attracted by this electromagnet, if sufficient current flows through this	train

audio_0_76997.wav	Remaining finished overheads, administrative expenses, selling and distribution expenses will treat them in the income statement or in the profit and loss account which we will prepare in the next class and then analyze that which are the components of the cost contributing to the say to increase the cost and if you want to reduce the cost then we have to focus upon those particular components elements and then we have to reduce the total cost of the production and increase the profits so remaining discussion and preparation of the income statement in this problem we will discuss in the next class	train
audio_0_136845.wav	g is a virtual function in B,s so it will do a polymorphic dispatch, it will be decided based on the type of object that q is pointing to which is s c type object, therefore, this will invoke the g function in the C class because it is decided by the type of the object	train
audio_0_37377.wav	And your own sadness when you relook at it in terms of the output that it has yielded, you also feel happy about it	train

audio_0_176241.wav	Because in 5 time constants the circuit voltage is there, then voltage value will decrease to less than 1 percent of its initial value so, the value of time constant is small or large will not impact, the steady state time, it will always be 5 times of the time constant	train
audio_0_101263.wav	So, it is very involved and have a lot of variability even if you are going to be using calibration, using empirical correlations	train

audio_0_72847.wav	so the sizes of each of the vertices can be different in general	train
audio_0_19747.wav	Now this is during the journey that the mother is going through with a child, so this we are open to seeing what all can probably go on your customer’s journey and this is after what is the emotional state	train
audio_0_190282.wav	So, whatever is the reading I am getting from the wattmeter I would call that as the rated core loss or no load loss	train
audio_0_179086.wav	Because these functions are oscillatory in nature and does not have the final values	train
audio_0_62155.wav	on the other hand, on one and three it is zero	train
audio_0_207185.wav	Here, we have this track and this wheel	train

audio_0_121504.wav	16	train
audio_0_42276.wav	So, that I wrote was equal to j omega epsilon E there is no current term over here and further let us just make it epsilon naught because we had discussed previously that the between the interface I mean at the interface between vacuum and PML epsilon mu were the same right	train
audio_0_189969.wav	Okay, so we will start off with equivalent circuit once again, okay	train
audio_0_69758.wav	look at this is very simple	train
audio_0_132461.wav	So, there is a rule which dictates as to how I can implicitly convert an integer to a double or a double to an integer, whether I can convert a pointer to a certain type into a pointer to wide and so on	train
audio_0_161805.wav	Now, there is one more topic known as subsidiary books	train
audio_0_67740.wav	it will be too expensive, right	train
audio_0_192954.wav	Because we have taken very long conductor initially, then we have placed the second conductor which is also carrying 1 ampere of current and we have placed them apart by 1 meter so I should say that this is the force that we are getting between these 2 conductors	train
audio_0_113362.wav	fc = 1 / What is the formula for the low pass filter for critical frequency fc equals to 1 upon 2 PIRC, we know it beautiful	train

audio_0_162637.wav	What we have covered today is we have started with cash flow statement, the importance of flow statement the three categories operating investing and financing particularly today we have discussed operating activities if it is bit difficult for you to understand don't worry in next session we are going to revise operating and again look at also look at investing and financing which will make the operating activities once again more clear	train
audio_0_58105.wav	on the other hand, when it goes clockwise, it is stopped	train
audio_0_76118.wav	We have been able to control the rate of the skilled labor but in case of the unskilled labor and in case of the semi skilled labor, the rate paid was higher and maybe some time it is beyond the control of anybody within the organization because labor comes from the outside	train
audio_0_125973.wav	Now since it is lossless, it should satisfy the unitary condition and from this equation we get the following equations	train
audio_0_165741.wav	So the priority is a increasing function of the task arrival rate	train

audio_0_64361.wav	i first compute the and of those two vectors, lets call it z	train
audio_0_72082.wav	so what i mean to say is that you have one row up cells here, you have one row up cells here	train
audio_0_153390.wav	So, there is not much application for the series capacitor in the distribution system right	train
audio_0_11024.wav	So, multiply by this 60	train
audio_0_182912.wav	And, the computer will then display that value on the screen in the form of an waveform ok	train
audio_0_112450.wav	Now, let us see that if you want to use the differential amplifier and you want to see whether it is working or not in case in terms of experiment, how to perform the experiment	train

audio_0_120405.wav	We can make use of this formula, just substitute NA and ND and then the values of ni for the different materials	train
audio_0_212566.wav	Once we click that, we can click Ok	train
audio_0_175069.wav	When we solve that we will get equivalent impedance in s domain that is nothing but R by 1 plus sRC	train
audio_0_137712.wav	But, if I write it as an initialization list, the compiler follows a unique approach	train
audio_0_73566.wav	so once you route one may be, you find the order of the other	train
audio_0_38795.wav	So, you can have this you can connect that device to port 0 and through this pull up resistors and as a result you can put you can put high current onto those ports; over those devices	train
audio_0_125427.wav	So one way of realising is if we have our length tuned properly of this open stub and say the resonant frequency is such that it corresponds to the high impedance state of this gap coupled resonator then that is an implementation of a shunt resonator in shunt	train
audio_0_136202.wav	So, in many places you may want to return by reference	train

audio_0_122459.wav	Now, the question is what are these scatterers that we talk about, and how do these values depend on temperature	train
audio_0_109380.wav	But the point is, you if you want to measure slew rate follow the steps and you will be able to measure the slew rate	train
audio_0_86918.wav	you can have a look at it	train
audio_0_35784.wav	These are all very convenient functions that python allows us to call implicitly, and allows us to use conventional operators and conventional functions in our code	train
audio_0_163834.wav	You can also go for debt to asset ratio, interest coverage ratio, and the last three ratios are particularly useful for shareholders which are in the form of PE ratio, dividend yield and so on	train
audio_0_38751.wav	So, ultimately the pin is getting affected; so, that way we can do the output operation on to the pins	train
audio_0_212589.wav	Now, I would like to make one more pattern like maybe an octagon I would like to construct here a small one	train
audio_0_110567.wav	So, let us see again come back to the slide	train
audio_0_47371.wav	There is a nice theorem from numerical analysis which we will not prove over here, but it says that for orthogonal polynomials the roots are always real and distinct, we will just use it ok; so, for orthogonal real and distinct roots alright ok	train
audio_0_137587.wav	Subsequently in C99, a change has been made to introduce a bool type	train

audio_0_180403.wav	So, this is the motion flux lines are upwards and this is the direction of the EMF ok	train
audio_0_60961.wav	if you go back to that lecture you will notice that in deriving this formula along the way there was a term which was proportional to del dot j, which we said was zero because of this steady current	train
audio_0_51728.wav	Now, also this is the gradient in spherical coordinates right so, let us write that down	train
audio_0_66005.wav	if you decrease this slack to zero, this r a t will also become one, because r a t minus a a t is slack	train
audio_0_38637.wav	So, this is the lowest bank having the registers R0 to R7 then we have got bank one going from R0 to R7	train
audio_0_67688.wav	so, coming back to the slide, so we, for every vertex v belonging to capital set of vertices, the requirement is the actual arrival time should not be grater then the required arrival time	train
audio_0_47586.wav	So, the plus point is, no need to store entire history of E and H and the minus point is store one new Aux variable auxiliary variable what which is psi	train
audio_0_147244.wav	CoolTerm can be downloaded from several sites	train
audio_0_208674.wav	So, what we do is after removing this entire materials thing, we revolve it down all the way; because we would like to see something like a complete view in this direction	train
audio_0_1041.wav	So, that emf is induced in the armature as in a generator right	train
audio_0_72238.wav	maybe the clock source cannot drive the current to a hundred or thousand points, so i need buffers to amplify the current	train

audio_0_12747.wav	So, O A is the maximum value of your what you call of a sinusoidal quantities	train
audio_0_185968.wav	So, say in the in one cycle current is flowing partly through this resistance not its not going completely through the meter ok	train
audio_0_149211.wav	So, why someone is doing what he or she was doing why people think the way they think, why certain type of acceptance rejection certain types of gossip certain type of rumors certain type of preconceive notions why some people are you know touristic and some or not all those in our dynamics of human behavior you would be very easily able to decipher and this in turn will make you extremely effective at your work place	train
audio_0_79245.wav	So, here we certainly go for as a customer, we go for looking for the best quality product	train

audio_0_4456.wav	60 right and P is equal to VI cos theta	train
audio_0_78632.wav	They are generating the power, they are transmitting the power and they are distributing the power and they are distributing the power	train
audio_0_10526.wav	Then if you single phase for the same power loss; for the same power loss right that volume of the conductor is 33	train
audio_0_209108.wav	So, this kind of problems exist for this perspective drawing	train
audio_0_140021.wav	So, this ensures that the data that was dynamically held up in this data member of the stack class can be released at this point	train
audio_0_194870.wav	Let us say I am able to measure this with the help of you know a multimeter or whatever and I know the values, so I can say I0 times Rs is a series resistance, fine	train
audio_0_3935.wav	This is the current i that moving going to this terminal this this node right	train
audio_0_37339.wav	Probably it is the brain mechanism which are doing it, brain as to bring to it homeostasis, the brain itself does not like that dysphoria the not feeling comfortable and more or less the societal stuff also	train
audio_0_118510.wav	42 E v	train
audio_0_107180.wav	So, if you are given an example of a differentiator, if you are given an example of a differentiator such that a sin wave 1 volt peak to peak at 1000 hertz is applied to a differentiator with the following specification, RF is given, C 1 is given, find the output waveform, find the output waveform	train
audio_0_192728.wav	So centrifugal force is something will open it	train
audio_0_146240.wav	And when you are trying to return back, you will have to jump back to the address that is stored in r14	train
audio_0_45114.wav	Negative sign; so, this expression can also be written as; Can I write it like this dot	train
audio_0_146700.wav	The example that I will be taking here is a bulb, and that bulb I will switch on by sending an SMS	train
audio_0_34733.wav	Here was our basic algorithm for gcd, which as we said more or less follows the definition of the function	train
audio_0_125383.wav	Well, that can act as a series resonator or a shunt resonator depending on the frequency	train
audio_0_171648.wav	So these two terms are defining the instantaneous power	train
audio_0_138335.wav	So, address which has only one type that is of the pointed type, but their type is decided based on what kind of value they are actually pointing to	train
audio_0_16471.wav	So, similarly for n th capacitor up to n 1 upon CN t 0 t it dt plus t n t 0 right	train
audio_0_4204.wav	4586 Kilo Watt	train
audio_0_85905.wav	So, 1 variance is activity level variance because the activity level has come down from 7 to 6 and then the flexible budget is that for the 6,000 fine 6 lakh has come down as the sales so have all actual expenses reduced proportionately at least the variable expenses or it is a situation that your variable expenses have not changed fixed expenses are not expected to change so the cost has remained the same sales have come down and the profit either has become a loss or the profit has proportionately come down that is the main objective here so two type of the variances we calculate here and these two variances are called as that when you compare the flexible budget of 6 lakhs with the actual results of 6 lakh it is called as the flexible budget variance and second is when you compare the budgeted information for static level of 7 lakhs with the flexible budget for 6 lakh that for the 7 lakh this was the performance expected	train
audio_0_192441.wav	Now, let us try to look at how the single phase induction motor works	train
audio_0_133827.wav	Finally, operators are necessarily predefined, functions can be defined as and when needed	train
audio_0_214773.wav	Now, where will you find these LbDs	train
audio_0_216409.wav	In the Implement Phase of ADDIE, we will train the instructors or the users of these materials, we may even create short videos and insert it into the e learning on how to use the materials, we will make sure learners have access to the materials, equip infrastructures and so on	train
audio_0_33450.wav	Now, why is there blank lines between every line in our file that is because when we readlines we get a backslash n character from the line itself	train
audio_0_77516.wav	S C	train
audio_0_8140.wav	So, from equation 2 and 3, we will get upon simplification all these things we get v 1 is equal to 1	train
audio_0_52191.wav	It drops by 1 by e right that is how we define bandwidth roughly right	train
audio_0_179232.wav	Why we want to study the behaviour	train
audio_0_102826.wav	So, this is estimated as 0	train
audio_0_33443.wav	These are the string manipulation functions and we will look at some more of them, but this is just useful one which has come up immediately in the context of file handling	train
audio_0_35726.wav	So, for instance, if you want to say that if we do not specify the x and y coordinates over a point then by default the point will be created at the origin	train
audio_0_92437.wav	Test plan is expected to take 5 weeks and testing is expected to take 25 weeks	train
audio_0_100494.wav	So, the overall energy that it can dissipate is definitely higher than compared to a situation where you are assuming hinged hinge at the top and the bottom	train
audio_0_63134.wav	now, timing driven placement techniques can be broadly categorized into three types	train
audio_0_72598.wav	i cannot distinguish, because under the each of these three faults the function changes in a same way: it is becoming zero, a constant zero function	train
audio_0_4097.wav	So, V c b is equal to V L, I c is equal to I L it will be cos , cos 30 degree minus theta right	train
audio_0_115976.wav	So, in the previous demonstration we looked at runtime relocatable code and we have seen that it requires that the loader have a lot of things to do and it requires the loader to go and modify the code and fix the address in each of the locations and a lot of this becomes much more simplified with a PIC, a position independent code	train
audio_0_212616.wav	This is a 2D thing	train
audio_0_210754.wav	In the last classes, we have learned about different kind of quadrants an object located, in the 1st quadrant, 2nd quadrant, 3ird quadrant, and 4th quadrant	train
audio_0_83012.wav	And for exercising the cost control, you always hit on the item which is biggest in amount	train
audio_0_40862.wav	So, I have my operator L, now phi I am going to write in terms of these guys	train
audio_0_173847.wav	So I 2 by I 1 will now become minus of N 1 by N 2	train
audio_0_12649.wav	So, when it is switching on at t is equal to 3, so, this will be actually 10 u t minus 3, right	train
audio_0_63423.wav	lets see this two terminology, skew and jitter, which are related to this distribution problem	train
audio_0_48863.wav	So, we have studied Pocklington integral equation right	train
audio_0_2143.wav	Rotor itself is a short circuit thing so this is r 2 resistance this s X 2 it is given as a your what you call that a variable symbol right	train
audio_0_170954.wav	However, in the dressing room it is still normally a hands off policy	train
audio_0_112164.wav	Both has anode both has cathode	train
audio_0_39118.wav	And this interrupt enable register; so, we are enabling the interrupt slight e a b set to 1	train
audio_0_147689.wav	Let us continue	train
audio_0_206343.wav	This is let us extend the scale so that we can draw a tangent to that circle, parallel to that we have to move to construct parallel lines	train
audio_0_63271.wav	this is the actual arrival time on pin j	train
audio_0_18679.wav	Hey, hi	train
audio_0_133057.wav	So, they are basically, different functions	train
audio_0_40980.wav	So, this is sort of what we did; if you want it to be more sophisticated going back to the very original question I asked the start of the module, what would you do instead what could you do instead if you want it more accuracy	train
audio_0_105017.wav	So, it will go to a positive terminal and that positive terminal is my drain because my VDS is applied in this particular fashion	train
audio_0_108350.wav	So, what is written here	train
audio_0_74918.wav	So, how much was paid at the end of July	train
audio_0_141536.wav	We have provision for having photos of our contacts, so will have some helper class as photo which will have image and the alternate text for the image and so on	train
audio_0_151335.wav	It reduces the magnitude and the steepness of the wave front that corona it reduces both that your magnitude as well as steepness right, within a few miles to a safe voltage	train
audio_0_82188.wav	It may be possible that temporarily because of the increased competition in the market because of the market dynamics or entry of the new players in the market, maybe the new players are very efficient in the market	train
audio_0_204455.wav	The ratio of new GM to the old GM would be square root of KN prime by KM	train
audio_0_42892.wav	So, this second part over here is moving from 0 to t as m is progressing and on the other hand as m is progressing this electric field value see tau keeps increasing	train
audio_0_191808.wav	How it gets induced we are going to see, the principle of operation	train
audio_0_177319.wav	We represent sinusoid like vT is equal to vM sine omega T	train
audio_0_151707.wav	And capacitor bank is a total assembly of capacitor modules electrically connected to each other	train
audio_0_37599.wav	And, similarly many a parents they start over expecting from their kids	train
audio_0_194398.wav	I would like to start with simplest of books, basically for electrical machines, although some of the topics I mentioned may not be covered very well in this book, nevertheless for a beginner it is very very easy to read that book so I would rather recommend that book, this book is written by P	train
audio_0_152879.wav	Similarly V 3 is equal to V 2 minus I 2 Z 2 put this V 2 value here and this I 2 and Z 2 value here right and calculate	train
audio_0_194033.wav	So, the Yoke through the Yoke it returns the magnetic field line return	train
audio_0_178430.wav	We can only turn off the independent sources which are connected to the network while leaving dependent sources connected to the circuit	train
audio_0_15254.wav	And cooling in brief air in small transformers and oil in large transformers, right cooling is a huge chapter, rightin a in a electrical engineering for transformers	train
audio_0_190506.wav	We are not violating energy conservation principle, very clearly	train
audio_0_174178.wav	So, let us say I1 is the mesh current in mesh 1, I2 is the mesh current in mesh 2 and voltage across terminals AB is Vth	train
audio_0_212753.wav	Now, let us give something like minus 5 mm	train
audio_0_169626.wav	If we find two people opting for the same position and facing each other the dialogue is confident and yet it moves in a positive direction	train
audio_0_169183.wav	When we meet a person for the first time then we quickly glance at a person and on the basis of what we see, we make an immediate judgment on the basis of these cues	train
audio_0_18590.wav	Yeah, like this course for example, for our students here they have a sort of mechanism that they are making sure that yes, I have learnt this topic well	train
audio_0_12161.wav	Hope you have understood this, little bit understanding is required	train
audio_0_49170.wav	So, even J is a function of r	train
audio_0_38715.wav	So, it is connected like this, but in between there are many other things	train
audio_0_60860.wav	ok, and therefore the x component is going to be whatever small b is coming from this current here, which i am showing in black, which is mu, not over two pi times i, which is going to be k, d, x polynomial length is k divided by square root of x square plus z square and is component in the x direction, which is in sin theta, which is going to be z over square root of x square, z square	train
audio_0_4981.wav	So, it will be minus 24 e to the power minus t 0 to infinity put this values you will get it is 24 joule right	train
audio_0_206579.wav	So, we are done with that center rectangle also	train
audio_0_205340.wav	Again part drawing, click ok, go to frontal plane, we would like to have a circular disc	train
audio_0_113114.wav	Now, next is filters can be passive filters, can be active filters	train
audio_0_131724.wav	So that is something which we have to look at in more detail to try and understand how we can control the durability of the concrete in the structure	train
audio_0_116426.wav	So in this way various tasklet are created only after their signatures are authenticated	train
audio_0_4044.wav	So, this is my , this is my your what you call that, watt this is my wattmeter and it measures the power P 1 and, load is taken as a star say	train
audio_0_178669.wav	So when you solve it, you will get this, anyways it is given in the question that Vp is equal to 110 angle 0	train
audio_0_52546.wav	Could be anything it could be for example, you know some bridge or cracks in concrete that is what civil engineers use these kinds of applications; let us say I have some structure and I do not want to I cannot open it up right	train
audio_0_170114.wav	It is said also about the intellectual achievement context in which our competence is evaluated, where red is associated with failure and green is associated with success	train
audio_0_47696.wav	So, for example, they consider a 90 degree bend in the waveguide which you would not be solve analytically right	train
audio_0_118492.wav	So, N c is nothing, but 2 times 2 phi m e star k T over h square whole power 3 over 2, N v is 2 times 2 phi m h star k T over h square whole power 3 over 2	train
audio_0_82278.wav	And when your market is only 2%, 1% or 3%, as against your standard estimate of 20%, you how big or how strengthful you might be, you have to miss revise your pricing system and then you have to bring it up to a level where we are able to recover the total cost, fixed cost and the variable cost and add some profits	train
audio_0_55465.wav	Let us discuss about the basis of the DCDC converter	train
audio_0_72344.wav	number of transistors will be much, much higher, so number of possible faults will also be much higher	train
audio_0_104020.wav	These deformations because these deformations are different you will have an increase in the compression that will occur across a compression structure that can form and this is the resisting mechanism once the interaction between the frame and the panel starts getting activated	train
audio_0_166717.wav	And the highest protocol requires that when a task requests a resource, then the priority of that the task is raised to the ceiling value	train
audio_0_419.wav	So, its come 110 ohm similarly Rb is equal to numerator will be remain same divided by R 2 20	train
audio_0_11369.wav	Therefore, what will happen you can write N 1 minus N 2 upon N 2 into N 2 upon N 1 Volt ampere auto right	train
audio_0_159798.wav	If there are some specific taxes on investing or financing related items, we will show it under the respective head	train
audio_0_127532.wav	Corrosion must be getting lower	train
audio_0_205460.wav	The metric threads for that purpose there is a symbol M perhaps it might be having a diameter of 12 mm	train
audio_0_11430.wav	Now, output is equal to 15 KVA at unity power factor	train
audio_0_184496.wav	So, this is without common ground	train
audio_0_70021.wav	so in the driving circuit it will be r by w, the inverter, the load capacity will load c, w and here for the r c delay for each segment, it will be ah r w by n	train
audio_0_186048.wav	Now, what happens this static characteristic or the property of the op amp that says that at this value of input ok	train
audio_0_42386.wav	The wave is travelling in any direction no the wave is travelling is incident on it in any direction that is what we showed this reflection coefficient that we had	train
audio_0_160660.wav	There was a very strong relationship with Enron and political parties	train
audio_0_110907.wav	Output will even decrease	train
audio_0_7067.wav	So, here your v 2 is equal to 20 minus 40 minus 20 volt because v 2 we got your what you call v 3 you got 20 volt because I told you that v 3 you got 20 volt	train
audio_0_151400.wav	So, ice crystal will be their positive I told you that if you reach 5000 kilometer or so, above the ground temperature of 0 degree and after that it become minus	train
audio_0_172261.wav	So node will be the connection between the two or more branches, Here in this figure we have three nodes, node a, node b and node c	train
audio_0_70972.wav	the p type transistors are coming in series, right, so now the issue is that if you have a scenario where there are more complex ah gates you are trying to implement	train
audio_0_150690.wav	So alternatively, what you can do is look for checking other way you can do, it i is equal to v upon Z 2, Z 2 is the surge impedance of the cable and refracted voltage is actually we got 19	train
audio_0_123249.wav	This corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1100 nanometers	train
audio_0_195901.wav	So it is provided by the yoke, so this will be our yoke	train
audio_0_56771.wav	let us do that	train
audio_0_18790.wav	Still we are helping out one person but we need to understand the other person’s perspective also	train
audio_0_56664.wav	this also means that b has components b, y and b z only	train
audio_0_107437.wav	So, let us understand how the input bias currents affect the amplifier operation, we will see few of the parameters and we will see how they are affecting the operation ok	train
audio_0_111601.wav	So, welcome for to all of you for this particular module	train
audio_0_66526.wav	now the question arises: this is source, this is drain, or the reverse, and this is the channel	train
audio_0_103075.wav	Here the failure is governed by sheer tension, right	train
audio_0_61478.wav	similarly, in water waves i create a disturbance that travels from one place to the other, but water does not go from one place to other	train
audio_0_107804.wav	and wWe should know a law called Lenz’s law; Lenz’s law	train
audio_0_208094.wav	For example, this is another arc	train
audio_0_68961.wav	that way you can make the clusters or the partitions grow	train
audio_0_191619.wav	I can have instead a short shunt I will show you just by a difference, so I am going to have the armature here, I can have the shunt just coming across like this and then I am going to have the series feel beyond this	train
audio_0_210954.wav	So, save	train
audio_0_125013.wav	The solution is that this quantity, gamma 21 which is dependent on the difference of z2 & z1	train
audio_0_59574.wav	in that limit we get v one is equal to minus sixty	train
audio_0_129878.wav	Now when you talk about structural analysis part you know you have only this much amount of steel left, so the remaining this much is lost actually so it is not that good thing to see because if you have uniform sectional loss then it is relatively easier to detect the problem and you can actually do an assessment and here it is very difficult to assess what is the residual capacity of the structures because you have this pitting which is happening at random locations, so it is very difficult to assess the residual capacity because of this	train
audio_0_72575.wav	at the chance of a and c, or b and d or a or d having a bridging will be much less because there is a wiring between	train
audio_0_184065.wav	So, we have a significant amount of error	train
audio_0_113918.wav	So thus we can infer that K0 XOR K4 would be equal to 50 and if we go back to what we have kept the values of these keys we have K0 and K4 is 50 and thus we see it matches the results that we obtain	train
audio_0_146755.wav	And we define this RELAY1 as 7	train
audio_0_214117.wav	So, any horizontal plane for a right circular cone if we are slicing it, we will see it as circle here, this is the circle	train
audio_0_46254.wav	So, where is the remaining gap	train
audio_0_40589.wav	That the equations will take care off; because when I impose this weighted residual condition	train
audio_0_104662.wav	What we are given we are given gain is given and then beta is given correct	train
audio_0_147313.wav	So, accordingly you can have a system where you can put this touch sensor along with the application where whenever somebody touches the sensor an SMS alert will be sent to your mobile	train
audio_0_53457.wav	We have studied this and we have also simulated this	train
audio_0_5659.wav	If it is a meter, then it will be your meter square, if d is in meter	train
audio_0_10940.wav	Then, it will become put in this expression, then it will become 2 pi B a n sin theta volt, right	train
audio_0_68016.wav	so the sat formulation goes like this: this is the most important step: whenever you are using sat to solve a problem, you have to map it properly	train
audio_0_173028.wav	So, we also saw that the property of these 3 elements and also saw what is the Ohms law	train
audio_0_5448.wav	So, your i 2 is equal to will be minus 2 ampere right minus 2 ampere so; that means, i 2 is known	train
audio_0_168143.wav	It helps them to give messages to each other and letting people know their affiliations	train
audio_0_178878.wav	That means line voltage will be equal to phase voltage coming across the load impedance	train
audio_0_66354.wav	this may so happen depending on the behavior of the circuit	train
audio_0_173130.wav	You can write V 1 divided by the impedance of the complete branch	train
audio_0_132958.wav	But as a thumb rule I would say rather 99	train
audio_0_19700.wav	Again, the next step is now she has to take off her helmet and scarf and probably pack it inside the trunk of the vehicle	train
audio_0_87857.wav	So, just start off with	train
audio_0_177298.wav	Because AC was able to transfer the power at a longer distance, losses were less and it was easier to generate for a higher voltage	train
audio_0_178647.wav	So if you put these values in this, you will get P loss divided by P dash loss equal to 2 times of r dash square divided by r square	train
audio_0_69927.wav	so if you simulate this whole circuit now, so you have modeled the driver, there is an inverter which is driving effectively	train
audio_0_154754.wav	That a leaders; return stroke will be going from this your earth to the your what you call to that cloud	train
audio_0_143229.wav	This is an important distinction to understand because patent law comprises of stuff substantive provisions for instance what can be patented is a substantive provision and it also comprises of procedural aspects	train
audio_0_113862.wav	shown here and what we see over here is the delay in clock cycles and over time	train
audio_0_202533.wav	So, the input is applied to gate source and the output is taken between the drain and source terminals	train
audio_0_89149.wav	these individual cells	train
audio_0_99220.wav	This is a different representation because the action on the wall is different	train
audio_0_141516.wav	From the last couple of modules we have been discussing about inheritance in C++	train
audio_0_53599.wav	The pole connected to T1 as shown here	train
audio_0_80084.wav	Cost per worker is not changing	train
audio_0_163894.wav	So, let us go to their net profit or profit for the period which is 715	train
audio_0_106637.wav	And slowly with the advancement of technology, we came to the present technology which is our IC	train
audio_0_121213.wav	So, you have aluminum, gallium arsenide can also have gallium arsenic and phosphorus for the higher wavelengths or the lower bind gaps can again have indium arsenide base materials, cadmium and mercury	train
audio_0_43244.wav	Only the	train
audio_0_112190.wav	MOSFET's are Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors	train
audio_0_202413.wav	So this is what we did with the common source amplifier and that is what we do now	train
audio_0_42378.wav	So, this PML is not for normal incidence this is this is going to absorb any wave that is incident on it	train
audio_0_62519.wav	very similar to recall: if i have a capacitor and i turned a current on through a switch, the current builds up slowly, or the charge in the capacitor builds up slowly, and the process: i end up supplying energy to it, which we finally interpret as if its stored either in the capacitor or in the electric field that is there	train
audio_0_79543.wav	That at what cost the product has been developed, say provided to the people and how the people's needs have been taken care of	train
audio_0_150360.wav	And what you would realize is that say again you come forward with 16 different types of combinations and then there are words written there, idealist, guardian, rational, artisans, so these are the brought temperaments	train
audio_0_30341.wav	This will be the data which will be require for calculation of the plastic section, modulus, actual plastic section, and then the bending strength of the section	train
audio_0_161752.wav	Prepare leisure accounts for Ram and company	train
audio_0_175922.wav	So it is apparent power because it seems apparent that the power should be the voltage current product which is by analogy with the DC resistive circuit	train
audio_0_209307.wav	Think about it ok	train
audio_0_64505.wav	but one thing is true: that you have a particular present cell, lets call it p, the next cell lets call it n, and the previous cell lets call it r	train
audio_0_213528.wav	When you are using that, there will not be any multiplicities involved in that surface construction, you will be having that unique representation	train
audio_0_216175.wav	So, if you have a facilitator in field like along with you, then you would mostly be creating an instructor like training which is referred to as an IoT, but if that is not there or they are available for a brief period of time, then you can go in for a blended learning, where in your learners have an online training for a brief period of time and then you have the facilitator on field or with them for a different period of time	train
audio_0_71714.wav	we run the pipe line at the same frequency but the voltage, initially it was v ref, now it has become v ref by one point eight, three	train
audio_0_191450.wav	And the other one will have only two parallel paths we talked about that	train
audio_0_180491.wav	So, 135 degree is here, so this is 135 degree ok, now at 135 degree I 1 is positive, but its less than maximum	train
audio_0_143291.wav	So, at every end of every term, you can renew their trademark and keep it alive	train
audio_0_170408.wav	Sorry, but if it is true I love him too	train
audio_0_120563.wav	So, this particular problem does not ask you to calculate the depletion widths, but you can go ahead and do the calculation and you will find that the depletion width is almost entirely on the n side and that there is a very small depletion width on the p side	train
audio_0_211101.wav	So, I have that object	train
audio_0_108376.wav	9, 5	train
audio_0_1676.wav	And line to line voltage is equal to root 3 times the phase voltage right	train

audio_0_58700.wav	i'll be applying a force in the opposite direction	train
audio_0_174107.wav	So, Vth upon Rth plus Rl would be the value of current I and then the square of that is I square and then multiplied by Rl would be the total value of power which would be delivered to the load	train
audio_0_175368.wav	So, we have to keep in mind that not all circuits can be converted into the equivalent Z parameters to a few of them are like we discussed with the help of ideal transformer example	train
audio_0_66783.wav	so if you want to express it as a percentage, multiply this by hundred	train

audio_0_192273.wav	Please understand the moment I say it is over hauling torque that means this has going to be a negative torque because we are talking about breaking	train
audio_0_52174.wav	So, you use a Gaussian current	train
audio_0_4123.wav	W 1 W 2 and W 3 and interesting thing this thing you have intentionally taken the this load is Unbalanced because Z a is simply 15 ohm , similarly Z b is 10 plus j 5 ohm and Z 6 minus j 8 ohm	train
audio_0_78882.wav	Then we found out that say the fixed cost was expected to remain the same	train
audio_0_194306.wav	So because of which you are going to have all these three as co phasal because 360 degrees is actually you know you are not going to have any phase shift at all, so if you look at the third harmonic for A phase, third harmonic for B phase, third harmonic for C phase	train
audio_0_176826.wav	Then sketching h t minus lambda is the key to the convolution process because it involves reflecting h lambda about the vertical axis and shifting it by t	train

audio_0_9125.wav	The resistance R g is variable that means, this resistance R g is variable between 2 and 55 ohm that means R g actually that means, if you write like this that means that means, your R g is lying in between these two, and 55 ohm right	train
audio_0_43005.wav	So, what do I need to talk about	train
audio_0_185644.wav	Why do you want this	train
audio_0_156893.wav	Now the process of over learning basically means that you keep on keep on keep on repeating it to an extent that the whole process becomes automated, okay	train
audio_0_211095.wav	The other line what we are going to use is now we have this point, this point, maybe I would like to remove this part of the curve here	train

audio_0_132980.wav	It is just a scoping rule, class also does scoping, but it does scoping with class semantics	train
audio_0_179724.wav	So, this would be short circuited and the same current will flow in the branch keeping other parameters same	train
audio_0_68583.wav	so here, as i had said, we are not working at the circuit level, so we are looking at the design specification at a much higher level and by using a suitable state encoding, we are also able to minimize the switching activity even at this higher level, right	train
audio_0_100013.wav	As far as the designation of the strength of the brick, it typically follows the compressive strength	train

audio_0_59526.wav	so this is the diagram, so here	train
audio_0_52806.wav	And therefore the magnetizing current rises up linearly like this	train
audio_0_58942.wav	similarly, in the other example, what i did, i took a parallel plate capacitor and i said there is a current which is coming in which is i t	train
audio_0_184238.wav	So, which means in this diagram this is equal to r i plus R meter and if I have anything else I am also including conductor resistance that may be negligible, but and if I have anything else in series	train

audio_0_102584.wav	We write that down as H0 by L, this M by H, the ratio of the bending moment to the shear force expressed as H0, H0 by L, and therefore this expression for LC brings in the shear span ratio, shear span of the section of the wall itself, the shear ratio of the wall section itself	train
audio_0_127846.wav	So, the user who has not tested the concrete is not really ensured of the quality, so there is always a benefit of doubt that we have to give to the user, there is also the always this unknown or the feeling that something could have gone gotten wrong	train
audio_0_160685.wav	So even experts in finance could not understand what they have written there	train

audio_0_191689.wav	K is actually the constant, I cannot write this as Ke because Ke when we write, we write Phi multiplied by Omega	train
audio_0_199921.wav	Now of course I am sure all of you are familiar with this set of equations	train
audio_0_184392.wav	So, now, if we measure the potential difference between this side, between this side and the other side which is behind which we cannot see, then we will see there is a potential difference	train
audio_0_180507.wav	So, this is how we can create a virtually moving magnetic field without any physical object being moving ok	train
audio_0_20427.wav	So this could include all he is notes and that textbooks for that relevant topic of study	train
audio_0_179033.wav	Then we will use the time shift property and we will write the Laplace transform of the second term that will become f1 s e to the power minus t s	train

audio_0_195635.wav	What I am applying is V1 what I am getting here is E1; I can also call that as E2 dash no harm in saying that, right	train
audio_0_63779.wav	now why i am saying is that in this grid representation, the size of each grid, this size of the each grid, should be large enough so that it can contain the line that is running through it and also the separation	train
audio_0_126352.wav	So, this is that value of the input power for which the value of the gain will be 1 dB lesser than what it should have been	train
audio_0_12093.wav	So, v c 0 plus is nothing but the v c 0 minus, because at the time of switching the voltage cannot be change instantaneously across the capacitor right	train
audio_0_137493.wav	Of course, we do not have a format here; it is a constant string being printed	train
audio_0_42798.wav	So, what is for example, let us look at part by part, what is the inverse Fourier transform of this beta tilde	train
audio_0_162387.wav	So we take profit or loss for the period and divided by number of shares	train
audio_0_1391.wav	So, 16 is here 16 i 3 minus i 4 because it is we have moving like this, this 16 i 3 minus I 4 because we are moving clock wise we are moving in the super mesh right we are moving like this like this right	train
audio_0_211098.wav	Now, release your mouse button	train
audio_0_136391.wav	The constructor needs to be called by value and so on so forth	train
audio_0_137025.wav	Swap may be one specific instance	train
audio_0_99318.wav	Under gravity they are basically distributing the load, the loads or the forces coming from the floor to the peers and have to be provided with lintels so that if it is unreinforced they don't crack	train
audio_0_118799.wav	So, once we plug in the numbers, I am just going to write the final answers, but you can just go through and check	train
audio_0_109579.wav	Let us see next one which is our flicker noise and then we will see burst noise	train
audio_0_98746.wav	As far as properties are concerned when you have hardened the compressive strength matters, the strength of motor matters, the tensile strength of motor matters	train
audio_0_216503.wav	The underline pedagogical design principle here is that a formative assessment that is we design learning activities that is specifically intended to generate feedback on performance to improve enhance and accelerate learning	train
audio_0_123649.wav	So, I have just equated n and p	train
audio_0_52505.wav	segment I mean	train
audio_0_132497.wav	And as I have seen with a large number of my students, in students mind the thinking always is that i is an integer possibly its value was 2; j is another integer possibly its value was 3	train
audio_0_147665.wav	There is a switch statement, which actually checks the value of variable “state”, it can be either 1, 2, or 3	train
audio_0_17464.wav	First of all I would like to thank you for spending your time on listening to these lectures	train
audio_0_165667.wav	So, this is under fixed assets, under non current assets	train
audio_0_63977.wav	that is the clock width constraint	train
audio_0_41983.wav	So, notice that all the terms on the left hand side and the right hand side have one factor in common which is E n i there all exponential so there will be multiplied with each other	train
audio_0_70648.wav	so r and q combined will correspond to the total are of the chip	train
audio_0_133130.wav	Standard namespace, so we have been talking about this that, all C++ puts all its standard library symbols, classes, functions, everything in the std namespace	train
audio_0_42428.wav	So, how many Yee cells have I drawn 1 or 4	train
audio_0_135348.wav	It means that, you always start with an index 0 and take as many elements as specified in the second parameter	train
audio_0_36569.wav	So, what we will do is we will get i plus n k for the largest n such that i plus n k is smaller than j, but if i go one more step, if i go to i plus n plus 1 times k then i will cross j right	train
audio_0_58324.wav	what is true about sigma one, sigma to two, q one and q two	train
audio_0_146865.wav	So, we have made two pins as RX and TX for Arduino, which is pin 10 and pin 11	train
audio_0_54453.wav	Immediately after you do the schematic you have this, you should have this and then of course edit 0 1	train
audio_0_45234.wav	It should come back	train
audio_0_74404.wav	So, for the moment I stop here and the remaining schedules we will prepare in the next class	train
audio_0_177773.wav	In that case if you see the response for current it would be exponentially decaying because of the exponential factor of e to power minus factor which you have	train
audio_0_174865.wav	Now what we need to find out	train
audio_0_1010.wav	Now, consider the magnetic field of a DC motor you know there is no current in the armature conductors the lines of flux path is shown in figure 10	train
audio_0_163903.wav	So, from 12% to 17% see NPAT is bound to be less because this is before tax	train
audio_0_130461.wav	And we saw that it was very interesting to that, it was a very nice correlation basically	train
audio_0_126154.wav	So, one example of a coupler, a very simple waveguide based coupler is suppose, suppose we have a waveguide with the partition in between and suppose this is our input port, let us number this, isolated port is usually represented by the symbol 2, coupled port is represented by the symbol 3 and throughput by the symbol 4	train
audio_0_123652.wav	So, that this is the fermi energy of an intrinsic semiconductor	train
audio_0_148106.wav	This is SIM900A GPS, GPRS MODEM	train
audio_0_4394.wav	So, it will be V upon Z1 plus V upon Z2 plus V upon Z3 right therefore, I is equal to Y1 plus Y2 plus Y3 V	train
audio_0_199331.wav	So, if I do connect it in series with RL like this, I will have ID0 times RL and RL is 100 kiloms	train
audio_0_33228.wav	And of course, i is always going to be less than or equal to j, because we are doing it from left to right, so we can assume that the segment is given to us with two end points where i is less than or equal to j	train
audio_0_69689.wav	so when we create metal or glass crystals, what you do	train
audio_0_14557.wav	Now, the way we do the current division same way the phi 2 actually phi 2 1 right, phi 2 is equal to this one it is phi 2 1 is equal to you can write the phi 1, this is the total flux into R 3 divided by R 3 plus R 2 the current division diode and here also flux division	train
audio_0_60555.wav	now, if i look at it from the top, as i said earlier, this is how m looks all over the place and best way to find divergence is using its definition, which says that divergence of m integrated over a volume is going to be equal to the surface integral over the surface of this volume	train
audio_0_141362.wav	I am doing a down cast and I have done that cast in terms of the way C allows me to do the cast which is the forced cast	train
audio_0_62150.wav	so going this way, i'll get one value which is exactly opposite of something	train
audio_0_64269.wav	number of flip flops is about two thousand two k, then your overhead will come to about six point seven percent	train
audio_0_56091.wav	so to understand this, let us again take this conductor, which is supposed to be solid and e zero inside	train
audio_0_141800.wav	If the objective of the university is only to create new knowledge through research and to disseminated, not for profit	train
audio_0_61112.wav	this arises simply from stokes theorem as follows: if i look at this boundary and make a very small loop here, the e field on this, the side like this, on the side like this, then e dot d l is going to be equal to integration	train
audio_0_3265.wav	So, this is closed this is closed and and this this is your node a, this v means your v infinity right the steady state value at that time this this one it is short circuited right	train
audio_0_140045.wav	So, the scenario is a class may have one or more constructors as many as it wants through different mechanisms of overloading, but it must have only one way to destruct and there is a profound reason that the things are defined this way because obviously, once when you are about to construct an object, you certainly have choice, you would like choice in terms of what kind of object what initial values for parameters and all that, you want to set and based on that it is quiet logical that you may need different mechanisms or different parameters sets to construct the object and therefore, you need a number of overloaded constructors	train
audio_0_206325.wav	So, for the top one, we always have to intersect generator generator line and the equal division made on one of the generator	train
audio_0_204426.wav	And all of them are correct of course, they are merely rearrangements of the same expression	train
audio_0_37197.wav	The very fact is the society it is still 10 percent by social political condition 20 percent should do it, but they are not that means, because they are not having an illness, because	train
audio_0_196324.wav	So if I am going to have Ef leading, I can say the power is flowing from Ef towards this side, this is the direction of power flow right	train
audio_0_48959.wav	This dotted line that I have drawn over here is the outermost boundary which actually it does not really exist, so I am I mean it is far away, so let us just call it S infinity	train
audio_0_14147.wav	Now, it is given n 1 is equal 300 rpm, n 2 is equal to 375 rpm and I a 1 is equal to 15 ampere this is given from which, from these 2 equations from these 2 equations, you can find out I a 2 will be 18	train
audio_0_200864.wav	How do you do that	train
audio_0_34674.wav	To look at the second type of equality that list3 and list2 are actually the same physical list in the memory	train
audio_0_38014.wav	That is the group which as to be assessed and treated right, now	train
audio_0_44069.wav	So, there are exactly like those secondary sources; because what is the location	train
audio_0_177462.wav	So, this is also very important point because whenever you want to present phaser in present sinusoid in phaser terms, it has to be first converted into cosine form	train
audio_0_129517.wav	This is the energy consumption again you see that there is a trend similar to what we saw in cement the energy required for an OPC M30 concrete goes down slightly when we have LC3 again because we have reduced the clinker and even more when we have PPC because LC3 require some energy for calcination of the clay which is not required for PPC	train
audio_0_48188.wav	Right hand side will give me 1	train
audio_0_192248.wav	Whereas in rheostatic breaking I am dissipating that energy in the form of heat, so I am not utilizing it	train
audio_0_137064.wav	Now, said that if we do a reference parameter, that is if we use call by reference, then the parameter actually is input and output parameter	train
audio_0_213778.wav	Once we have that x, y, z information; it will construct at the background a parametric variation P of u, v; any point on that surface can be interpolated using information of first point P 0, second point P 1 and third point P 2	train
audio_0_116098.wav	Another entry is the Machine details, which processor was this particular file compiled for, it could have entries like i386, X86 64, ARM, MIPS, and so on	train
audio_0_126627.wav	We all know that we want transistor in our amplifier to be highly efficient	train
audio_0_69326.wav	if you are saying that you will be using a rom to store your input vector, to store your output response, you need ah rom of a very large capacity, large size, because for a modern this circuits circuits let say you made a requiring millions of test vectors and and in the circuit there can be hundreds of outputs	train
audio_0_169257.wav	However, it shows interest friendliness and curiosity because it is relatively mild	train
audio_0_32468.wav	If we do not balance it then the danger is that if we keep inserting and sorted sequence then we keep inserting larger values it keeps adding on the right child	train
audio_0_171277.wav	Theorist were working in the area of NLP suggest that the natural eye movements that accompany thought processes are never random	train
audio_0_23670.wav	Now we will go one by one	train

audio_0_142372.wav	Now, I had mentioned this when I wrote my first book in 2007	train
audio_0_80762.wav	You must be knowing that today we have the power companies	train
audio_0_121850.wav	This is important because, trap states can usefully trap the carriers and these have a longer lifetime then the electrons and holes in the band	train
audio_0_130542.wav	There is a shrinkage of the order of six hundred in this case six hundred to seven hundred micro strain	train
audio_0_119216.wav	So, there is a trade off on what material you choose in order to get the maximum value of the power	train
audio_0_190125.wav	The maximum we can do is to use a material which is of very very low resistivity	train
audio_0_154839.wav	I mean if it happens that from the tower and their line insulators also connected, there will be flash over between the tower and the insulator to one or more of the phase conductors	train
audio_0_46978.wav	If you remember that was our operator equation on which we have studied the method of moments right	train
audio_0_120237.wav	1350 mu h, which refers to the mobility of the holes in the valence band slightly smaller	train
audio_0_180769.wav	Then, also can you see this green line, if I extend it will not intersect with this black line	train

audio_0_155749.wav	98735 minus j 0	train
audio_0_167833.wav	In this show we find that the protagonist Doctor Cal Lightman who has been modeled on Paul Ekman, the famous psychologist and his colleagues in what is known as the Lightman group take up assignments from different parties and most of these parties are the local in the federal law enforcement agencies and they assist in investigations and normally they are able to reach at successful conclusions and find out the reasons behind different crimes	train
audio_0_47707.wav	So, technically Meep is implementing this turn on function using tan hyperbolic function and as I mentioned there is a open source we can go and look at the code and see all that information	train
audio_0_146650.wav	The analog out you can connect to one of the analog input pins and 5 volts and ground	train
audio_0_71218.wav	if p x is the average, which the median	train
audio_0_130660.wav	RILEM is a place where researchers meet, it is sort of an association that researchers in construction materials and structures and systems meet, work together to bring about new reports, bring about recommendations that could lead to standards	train
audio_0_183988.wav	And so, let us consider of a situation and so, I particularly request you to listen to this particular topic very carefully because this is one topic which I myself had confusion or doubt for many years ok	train
audio_0_137675.wav	The destructor will go through	train
audio_0_210404.wav	To draw parallel, perpendicular, and inclined lines, we use these drafter along with set squares	train
audio_0_160875.wav	Instead of writing total capital, we will say A's capital, B's capital, C's capital	train
audio_0_194931.wav	So, what I am getting in the X plate is not really H and not even Im in amperes, it is rather Im multiplied by whatever is the series resistance I have got	train
audio_0_167767.wav	One is POGICs 1 which deals with system interface, that is what are the system routines and what are their parameters and the semantics what it does	train
audio_0_124460.wav	In the next module, we will see how using these resonators we can actually build the narrowband filters	train
audio_0_126846.wav	So this is the 1st equation using KVL	train
audio_0_66767.wav	sometimes it is meeting, sometimes it is not meeting changes in parameter values of transistors resistances over time	train
audio_0_155647.wav	So, you will get basically after simplification all this things you will get V 3 is equal to 0	train
audio_0_68531.wav	right, but what i have achieved is that earlier there are two nodes that were high activity, but now there is a single node which is high activity, right	train
audio_0_12521.wav	So, that is the idea rather than then moving like this, if we represent circuit, if we represent the source voltage source or current source right, by we multiplied by unit your step function, how when we will solve the circuit at that time we will know how it behaves, right	train
audio_0_217106.wav	now you may want to switch on the ah camera to actually catch the face of the person who, on which you want to start either recording or use it for the purposes of authentication, in case it is a door access system	train
audio_0_66155.wav	if i apply c equal to zero, the second term vanishes and the c bar becomes one	train

audio_0_50479.wav	Integrating over v 2 right	train
audio_0_46709.wav	So, v phase by c ideally, I am just stimulating vacuum only; so, ideally this ratio should be 1 right so, this is 1, and here what I will plot is delta x to make it sort of normalized to wave length because as a frequency changes, everything delta x will have to change I will just do this the wave length that this electromagnetic wave is going	train
audio_0_144680.wav	Now, the conversion part is something which is often neglected in an IP policy there could be instances where the routine manner in which patents are filed by filing a provisional because Provisionals are normally filed in a hurry there is some urgency to be met and you file a provisional, but then following it up with a complete is something that would be done within say 12 months time	train
audio_0_120389.wav	We have seen earlier that ni depends upon the band gap NcNvexp Eg2kT	train
audio_0_62810.wav	equal stands for engineering change order	train
audio_0_118152.wav	So what we see is that this is our hardware Trojan, we have the trigger over here and this E value is what gets leaked to the output of the multiplexer	train
audio_0_52374.wav	Now, one thing that you will notice is in these equations what is the variable of integration	train
audio_0_190917.wav	So you are going to have a very large value as synchronous reactance which tells me when I calculate regulation eventually the drop could be pretty large	train
audio_0_37405.wav	You are not having cancer, but we still feel bad	train
audio_0_185614.wav	So, how an aerodynamic damping can be used	train
audio_0_185434.wav	Now, the difference can be 1 volt 2 volt 4 volt anything, but the output will be same as 12 volt constant, it is not going to change ok, but on this side left side V P is less than V N	train
audio_0_183721.wav	Now, how much is the flux linkage of this coil at any particular time	train
audio_0_62849.wav	now this is just an example	train
audio_0_101465.wav	So, add to this, you look at the effect of the equilibrium for the gravity forces	train
audio_0_196690.wav	But, the slip at which the maximum torque occurs that has R2 in the numerator, which means as I increase R2, if I increase R2 like in the case of a slip ring induction motor, where I can include resistances from externally okay	train
audio_0_57969.wav	we know v equals to i, r and we know v by r equals to i, which is equals to d q by d t	train
audio_0_133756.wav	We are not immediately going into depths of static polymorphism	train
audio_0_43260.wav	Well what is important about these constants are let me just write it over here you said this as a j into something ok	train
audio_0_139558.wav	So, let us take a little different and bigger example	train
audio_0_213908.wav	After that we will go construct a metric 10 thread	train
audio_0_146834.wav	If it sends either from this number or from this number, then it should work	train
audio_0_38548.wav	So, P 0 to 7 goes to this latching of latching of this lower order address bus here and the data bus is connected to D0 to D7	train
audio_0_166531.wav	We are looking at the rate monotonic scheduler and we had looked at some issues, the schedulability analysis and also we looked at the transient overload handling and so on	train
audio_0_11301.wav	This one we consider as 1 winding and this one, we consider another winding right	train
audio_0_35913.wav	A much more useful problem in practice than the longest common subword is what is called the longest common subsequence	train
audio_0_62880.wav	this is the more complex sub problem among the three, say, horizontal and vertical channel	train
audio_0_166327.wav	A non preemptible resource is one where once a task is using the resource, we cannot preempt it any time that we need to another task to run, need to wait until the task completes use of the resource	train
audio_0_110940.wav	So, if this is the case if this is the case, let us let us actually implement the circuit implement the circuit on the breadboard on the breadboard and let us see what happens what happens to our output voltage when we apply 5 volts peak to peak sine wave	train
audio_0_46498.wav	So, that is a very common requirement yeah	train
audio_0_68196.wav	but in case of line search algorithm, the concept is somewhat different	train
audio_0_15110.wav	Say 4000 your, a 4500 upon 225 voltage in a step down transformer 50 Hertz, 50 Hertz means the frequency, right f is equal to 50 Hertz	train
audio_0_195444.wav	Although most of the flux will go like this may be, one or two of flux lines will go like this and go like this	train
audio_0_137582.wav	We all know that C has a possible use of a Boolean type, which is a type where we say that it can take a value, either true or false	train
audio_0_66703.wav	it can be a chip, it can be a circuit which consists of several chips	train
audio_0_171971.wav	The current cannot change instantaneously so the value of current I naught will be 5 ampere	train
audio_0_67113.wav	so the interconnect delays we have already talked about the r c delays and other things	train
audio_0_78076.wav	We discussed different type of the variances, material variance, labor variance and overhead variances, and all those variances were linked to the direct cost or the variable cost	train
audio_0_69321.wav	i means again, let us argue that i am applying one thousand test patterns to a circuit	train
audio_0_162899.wav	So, the market control as envisaged in a US model or Anglo US model is not very active	train
audio_0_45180.wav	This is inevitable if I use this	train
audio_0_46757.wav	Now, what happens if there is some other object in the vicinity of this antenna, that object will also have some current induced, I mean the field will fall on it, induce some current that induced current in turn will radiate another field, that field will come and fall on this antenna	train
audio_0_183462.wav	So, therefore, VN can be found out using potential divider rule again this is V o this is 0	train
audio_0_20663.wav	Now you could go three levels, four levels and get more out of this case	train
audio_0_132942.wav	And if I do this, the car will get started, sample composition based model	train
audio_0_183613.wav	So, if you want, we can have more turns ok	train
audio_0_76088.wav	So, this is 1100 favorable	train
audio_0_93000.wav	But then somebody can think of a purely incremental model where there are no iteration in which the system is just developed in small increments and given to the customer but the customer feedback is not really taken to change the existing functionality there is no iteration in a incremental model, the software is developed in increments and delivered to the customer	train
audio_0_126774.wav	That is, there will be no component of magnetic field along the direction of propagation but the electric field along the direction of propagation will have to be nonzero	train
audio_0_162228.wav	So, all the expenses for any company are to be put under six heads	train
audio_0_22916.wav	Now following the steps we will go through this example and we will be able to understand how to design a splice ok	train
audio_0_38931.wav	So, this is the order; however, trap has lower priority than the hold signal used for DMA so will come that, so there are if you remember there are 2 pins hold and hold acknowledge available in 8085 so they are used for a particular type of data transfer which is known as direct memory access or DMA	train
audio_0_13543.wav	And then here voltage is your ah v 1 and raise 2	train
audio_0_128462.wav	It is actually different relaxation times T 1 T 2	train

audio_0_176464.wav	So in case of h parameters we were having V2 is equal to 0 that is output port was short circuited	train
audio_0_18196.wav	Obviously if there is less time involved in preparation, then it means that the number of notes that need to be shared should be less	train
audio_0_146502.wav	So, memory is an important factor that is to be decided when you develop and embedded system, number of ports and their types	train
audio_0_156903.wav	And the task at hand, the best examples of Mnemonics is, rhymes and jingles	train
audio_0_173317.wav	So, force is now connected to x1	train
audio_0_65.wav	Because as soon as otherwise as soon as we switch on back emf will not be there and you if you make it at a very small you are what you call where is I mean it is at a minimum value	train
audio_0_7817.wav	There if you to see your what you call the design of this synchronous generator I mean, when the repair is or something you will find it look so beautiful that you are what you call that is a in first synchronous generator in the power plant right	train
audio_0_120264.wav	16 times 10 to the 5 meters per second	train
audio_0_170648.wav	So, they like a visual aid	train
audio_0_124205.wav	Say we have 2 networks in series, I am calling these 2 networks to be in series because they have the same currents flowing through them, so this is network 1 and this is network 2	train
audio_0_103048.wav	But when this wall deforms, the bed joints are now going to be subjected to a state of shear	train
audio_0_72369.wav	in terms of the circuit connections, there will be a connection to power supply	train

audio_0_34244.wav	So, by examining the value of whatever is returned we can check whether the update we intended worked or not	train
audio_0_104500.wav	Here we have considered the amplifier is your non inverting amplifier	train
audio_0_2091.wav	So; that means, the your reaction field is F2 we have drawn right in the diagram of the rotor is always stationery with respect to the stator field F1 or the resultant field Fr right so all these things are remain stationary	train
audio_0_41777.wav	Is there some does are you reminded of some way of evaluating this limit as r tends to 0	train

audio_0_181594.wav	So, let me write input impedance of this difference amplifier is this 2 times R 1, where R 1 is this resistance ok; and this is for this type of connection, I repeat for this differential connection without common ground, right	train
audio_0_198767.wav	So, if I have, I am having probably it is bound in a particular way it should be manifesting itself the dot and cross in the it opposite sense to that of your armature current that is all, so they will be connected in series with the brushes themselves normally, so if I am carrying only 5 ampere of armature current I want the compensating winding also to create a flux only corresponding to 5 ampere	train
audio_0_43405.wav	So, this basis function is non zero only in a some domain of the entire domain it is not nonzero everywhere right that is why the word is self explanatory that is why it is called a sub domain basis function	train

audio_0_40805.wav	Right those are called higher order elements	train
audio_0_120191.wav	So, this explains, while silicon is opaque because visible light has a wavelength less than 1000 nanometers, the visible range is from 400 to 800 nanometers, which means silicon will be able to absorb the visible light and produce electrons and holes	train
audio_0_46579.wav	So, for we have not done that so now, let us see how do we evaluate let us say, so which is the equation that we are trying to do	train

audio_0_213873.wav	Now what we have to do is, draw a vertical line through this P	train
audio_0_135208.wav	But it does not know what that type is, what it does not know how the type is implemented and it does not care because it is just looking at a reference	train
audio_0_175666.wav	Now, what you have to do	train
audio_0_73175.wav	so, although it looks like the lengths are equal, but there can be some parasitic, resistance and capacitance effects, right, and these parastics may not be the same for both the lines because it depends on the lines which are running parallel to those lines on the same layer across different layers	train
audio_0_141994.wav	All these are restrictions that the owner of the copyright can impose on a person who has purchased the book	train

audio_0_57107.wav	i will that what the image charge should be, alright, behind the dialectic as an assignment problem and send it over the assignment	train
audio_0_156978.wav	This creates a mental image which in turn will help you recollect the number very fast okay, so this is called number peg technique and with this we have come to an end to our discussion on the topic memory, just to summarize we talked about the three structures of memory, the sensory, short term and long term memory okay, and in long term of course we devoted to much of time to understand different, different formats of a long term storage okay, semantic memory, we talked about episodic memory okay	train
audio_0_51713.wav	So, the next think that I have to do is find out so, look back over here at the steps I had do I have my J now; I mean I had my J, I had my G, I calculated A	train
audio_0_32867.wav	We have to make sure that eventually we will reach this point	train
audio_0_194724.wav	You get my point, if it is a cylinder if I cut it and spread it, it will look like a rectangle if this portion is A and this portion is B So this is essentially A and this is essentially B and when I fold it, it can become like a cylinder	train
audio_0_12869.wav	Or other way we can write if you take the v as the reference, let me clear it, otherwise your this is my v and this is my I, right	train
audio_0_66090.wav	if this is zero, also g will become zero and of course, g stuck at zero	train
audio_0_47911.wav	And we are done this to avoid, what	train
audio_0_176063.wav	So, because of this the number of equations would be reduced and it is much easier to solve this kind of circuit	train
audio_0_203637.wav	So that is not what you want	train

audio_0_200072.wav	These things are described in more detail in basic electrical circuits or you can use some of the textbooks that you may have which describe the op amp	train
audio_0_85422.wav	So, for the financial budget you have to prepare two statements	train
audio_0_70791.wav	so what i mean is that this plus means a horizontal cut and the star means a vertical cut	train
audio_0_190859.wav	I am looking at a magnetic field which is revolving, so I am looking at an equivalent AC current that would have produced the same strength of magnetic field as I have produced now with the DC current which I am rotating at synchronous speed, right	train
audio_0_14003.wav	256 and initial energy stored was 0	train
audio_0_191972.wav	I am going to have probably the north pole here and south pole here and so on that is it, that is what I am going to get	train
audio_0_71293.wav	the same thing as i have illustrated	train

audio_0_207846.wav	With that visual we can easily recognize how this pyramid is inclined	train
audio_0_106262.wav	So, the idea is until and unless you short both the things or you place something on the inter digitated electrodes you will see infinite impedance	train
audio_0_105525.wav	So, what are those characteristics like I said if you take a ideal operational amplifier, then you have infinite of voltage gain we will see, but practical operation amplifier it would be somewhere around this value, in input impedance is infinite	train
audio_0_72263.wav	suppose i have, i have, a buffer which is directly driving, let say, hundred clock loads	train
audio_0_40772.wav	So, by constructing by using these two shape functions as your basis functions what you are allowing	train
audio_0_92840.wav	38 so roughly it will give 8	train
audio_0_16195.wav	So, let me clear it; that means, whatever current is flowing your this i 2 current is flowing here right 2 20 and 30 both are in series and i 1 minus i 2 also flowing through 50; that means, i 1 minus i 2 is equal to i 2	train
audio_0_164325.wav	So, more assets are getting locked up, relatively giving lesser profitability	train
audio_0_61907.wav	this is the poisson's equation	train
audio_0_26450.wav	25 D so this will become 410 kilonewton meter So maximum bending moment we can find out as this okay So once we get maximum bending moment we can find out moment due to impact also impact so due to impact additional 25 percent load will come into picture so 25 percent of this maximum bending moment that is coming 102	train
audio_0_194850.wav	So, I am going to show this as I0 and this has W0 and of course the voltage applied here is rated voltage	train
audio_0_52574.wav	So, that is the problem with MRI	train

audio_0_165064.wav	So, audit committee, though is a part of board, is supposed to overlook the functioning of the board to whom the auditors make interim reporting	train
audio_0_86969.wav	Now the question is yes indeed what here when I am drawing that yes from the pre existing cell, I am getting another cell sure, sorry, I mean out here; out here, yeah definitely, from cell this green one, this is the new cell	train
audio_0_59523.wav	so you get gamma is equal to gamma is equal to two	train
audio_0_192301.wav	You will get this EB value to be very clearly greater than 230 because it is VT plus IA RE right	train
audio_0_130566.wav	Now why do we have to go to all these lengths	train
audio_0_143889.wav	Now, Guilds and trade organizations in the earliest times identified goods by marks as a means of liability	train
audio_0_204000.wav	So, what you can say is that in this part of the curve the diode voltage does not change much	train

audio_0_143316.wav	And if it gets killed then you cannot file a patent for your invention	train
audio_0_41907.wav	So, it is this is what I want to do; now I am looking at electric fields on the grid ok; so space derivatives	train
audio_0_148850.wav	It should lead you to a point where if there is a similar situation that you are experiencing for the second time or for n number of times you just extend your previous experience and based on the similarity between the two situations you decide last time this was the appropriate response therefore, this time also this is the appropriate response	train
audio_0_4785.wav	So, what we can do is first and because of that some constant equation will come	train
audio_0_205049.wav	We will select all of these	train
audio_0_39496.wav	So, actually it would be tempting to set p equal to minus 1, but remember epsilon r and mu r need not be constants	train
audio_0_41890.wav	So, it is very good we have a reference solution	train
audio_0_112495.wav	So he is connecting to the output of the differential amplifier	train

audio_0_130311.wav	So the point is, we know that there are advantages in terms of reducing CO2 footprint, right, less limestone is needed to make this cement, kiln temperature is two hundred degrees Celsius lower than what you use for Portland cement, the grinding energy is low	train
audio_0_141018.wav	Now, if I considered this particular function you can see two things; one is it has a large number of parameters, 11 parameters and to be able to use this you will typically need to know what these 11 parameters mean and you will need to specify those parameters	train
audio_0_149469.wav	But then if you go deep down you realize that these two tools might not be appropriate for handling every question that you are interested in	train
audio_0_88269.wav	And this is a tank which has to be replenished time to time with the with nitrogen as your every time you are opening it	train
audio_0_4895.wav	And same thing is asking for mesh analysis right, both you will do	train
audio_0_190045.wav	So, there are two drops clearly, voltage drops, we are considering mainly the series portion because that is where the voltage is dropped, right	train
audio_0_115304.wav	So, this particular traverse heat function takes a memory location	train
audio_0_183690.wav	Now, let me take a 3rd coil ok	train
audio_0_215094.wav	So, and many of us many teachers do it, but what is important is that we should require learners not only to make the prediction, but also to articulate the reasons as to how they arrived at the prediction so this is an example of articulation	train
audio_0_61294.wav	that electromagnetic field carries momentum, and i am going to now demonstrated this formula through an example	train
audio_0_16373.wav	So, this current we are taking i what you call that your short circuit current; that means, here no current here 5 5 ohm this thing resistance actually it will ineffective the because this is shorted	train
audio_0_96307.wav	1 and the poisons ratio of motor would be about 0	train
audio_0_196948.wav	So, what we are trying to do in the second case, that is the diverter case is to divert some portion of the current away from the field coil, so that again we are reducing the M M F	train
audio_0_64292.wav	so, as i said, we can use the fault simulation tool for various purposes	train
audio_0_175869.wav	Similarly you can say that if you connect the AC voltage source then how power would be dissipated by that particular element and when we equate the power for DC and AC we get the value of effective voltage	train

audio_0_107044.wav	The most common dopants are Boron and Phosphorus to create your N channel and P channel for your MOSFETs	train
audio_0_206642.wav	The first step is you always have to save it	train
audio_0_43773.wav	5 right, this one is 0	train
audio_0_13975.wav	So, direction of this current that what you call is ah through i 4 ohm resistance it is given this way right	train
audio_0_135294.wav	Now, suppose I want to have a bounded set	train
audio_0_12154.wav	And this capacitor is connected this 20 ohm resistance is connected ah across the capacitor right	train
audio_0_167102.wav	And remember that these are simple scheduler, these are not preemptive, only the start execution of a program in each frame and it is not that some high priority task can arise and then we have to pre empt some tasks etc nothing	train
audio_0_154820.wav	So, in any case the voltage induced on the line propagates along the line as a traveling wave	train
audio_0_43899.wav	Now, what is the problem with this equation	train
audio_0_19287.wav	I think identification of the right problem is the key for the entire process what we will be going through	train
audio_0_120234.wav	You have silicon mu e, which is the mobility of the electron in the conduction band is around 1350 centimeters square volts per second	train
audio_0_210452.wav	5 millimeters, 0	train
audio_0_177785.wav	Now, transfer function method is valid only for linear time invariant systems whereas State equations can be applied to linear as well as nonlinear system	train
audio_0_213283.wav	We have to draw a line from point q', so we have located q' point and a 120 degrees line we will draw it in that way, and this meets horizontal line at 50 mm above XY	train
audio_0_85536.wav	So it means these two stories tell us that yes, we can go for it and we can say win over the hearts of the people, we can change the dynamics of the market, we can say earn a significant market share within no time provided in a price sensitive economy we are able to keep the cost of production under control and with the help of standard costing we are going to do that or we normally do that in the businesses	train
audio_0_542.wav	So, these are the certain relationship you have to keep it in your mind	train
audio_0_194072.wav	So definitely we are essentially retaining so advantage if I try to write it	train
audio_0_161313.wav	In liability side the first item written is authorize share capital although keep in mind that this is not to be taken in the total	train
audio_0_62895.wav	there is a channel here horizontal orientation	train
audio_0_133058.wav	So, then she will come back after putting encapsulating them into namespaces	train
audio_0_211250.wav	We are in Module number 4 and Lecture number 37	train
audio_0_47969.wav	Once you calculate all the matrix I mean the integral I A I B is equal to h and 0, this is after the MoM procedure has been carried out	train
audio_0_17812.wav	So basically you are saying that you used to read	train
audio_0_168012.wav	Now, this is a similar gesture to the one I have just shown, but here the hand is nearer to the mouth and the thumb is supporting the chin, which means that the person has negative thoughts about what you are saying	train
audio_0_175385.wav	It means that you can represent this circuit as T equivalent	train
audio_0_151696.wav	And what will be your ah voltage magnitude	train
audio_0_47527.wav	So, now, let us try a little bit more of algebra to see how we can simplify things further	train
audio_0_40197.wav	So, I could solve the whole problem with n 1 or I could solve it with n convention depends on me ok, I am going to choose n	train
audio_0_85586.wav	Only experts are involved in calculating the standard cost	train
audio_0_34138.wav	So, the main reason for this plus 1 here is to avoid having to write minus 1	train
audio_0_63939.wav	so the first factor that affects the skew is the electrical symmetry of the network	train
audio_0_104892.wav	And f first are R you had to calculate for the low pass filter, the feedback it registersresistors and capacitor isare there thatwhich you had to calculate	train
audio_0_172184.wav	That means that it is not necessary that it will create a close loop, So it can have the close loops but there may be some open loops also	train
audio_0_114245.wav	So, recollect that in the previous lecture when we looked at the buffer overflow and how the attacker wrote his payload in the stack and then executed that particular payload is that the attacker was able to inject code by writing to the stack and then execute in the stack	train
audio_0_19169.wav	In that I would like for the entire team anybody can pitch in is have you actually seen	train
audio_0_1692.wav	So, in this case, so it is line current magnitude is equal to your write as a phase current here	train
audio_0_101655.wav	So, m20 grade of concrete and as far as the steel is concerned, you have to have a minimum cover of 15 m m at the top and bottom and 20 millimeters cover on the sides	train
audio_0_205479.wav	If things are equi spaced we go with EQSP equi space kind of things	train
audio_0_48228.wav	So this module is going to be about the method of moments which is the name given to the way in which we solve the integral equations	train
audio_0_192079.wav	I see that I am going to get an MMF wave which will keep on rotating at the same speed as that of the oscillatory speed of the sinusoidal wave which is the current wave	train
audio_0_173397.wav	Characteristic equation of the system is defined as the left side portion	train
audio_0_106108.wav	So, we have seen in this particular module high pass filters, we have seen the main difference between high pass and low pass filters is that in the high pass filter the capacitor is at the starting and the resistor is next; in the low pass filter we feed the value to resistor and then to capacitor	train
audio_0_184274.wav	So, this is the question and let us find out the answer ok	train
audio_0_81513.wav	And operating budget is we prepare the, we start with the sales budget and to achieve that level of sales, how much production is required and how to attain that given level of the production	train
audio_0_215418.wav	then how do we assess the learners for tasks at different levels	train
audio_0_107042.wav	Here, you can see the mask thickness and can grow the silicon dioxide for diffusion	train
audio_0_97962.wav	Reinforced brickwork for beams and reinforced brickwork for slabs was something that was in use in the early 1900s in this country in the Indian subcontinent and gained prominence primarily after poor performance of masonry buildings in some devastating earthquakes across the subcontinent	train
audio_0_214370.wav	Whatever the thing we have constructed here is that making sense is that making sense from this top view	train
audio_0_56858.wav	So, there should be in a here, this cancels and we are left with partial v x by partial x a b c	train
audio_0_193289.wav	So similarly, if there is a winding coming along here you can see this is also coming along the cusp almost at the end it is being inserted	train
audio_0_32072.wav	So, y is never smaller than x, and z is never smaller than y	train
audio_0_40108.wav	g 1 right, k square term goes away, and now I am left with the right hand side	train
audio_0_173879.wav	We have to first try to convert delta into star	train
audio_0_146809.wav	Now, if buffer	train
audio_0_136294.wav	For example, if you try to say okay, am, I would like to change the reference by putting c to b, but then b is a	train
audio_0_169264.wav	In dyadic situations particularly the evidence of eye contact passes on negative connotations	train

audio_0_212635.wav	For that purpose you click your scroll button, click and move the mouse in different directions ok	train
audio_0_124588.wav	In fact, it should be less than 2 dB	train
audio_0_136539.wav	Please recall your C	train
audio_0_179746.wav	So, now, we have to prove this value of I again would be 1	train
audio_0_207897.wav	This inclined to vertical plane we can see only in the top view	train
audio_0_57090.wav	remember if i had a metallic slab on the left, there will be no field inside	train
audio_0_136702.wav	Now, in this context, we can see that the actual object that is created has a type which is of B; this has a type which is of B	train
audio_0_184745.wav	Similarly if I have R X much less than R V then choose this circuit this means a once again this circuit	train
audio_0_59958.wav	however, we have seen the del square, phi zero, so this terms drops out	train
audio_0_197035.wav	If I am talking about the flat or level compounded motor, it is a differentially compounded DC motor, right	train
audio_0_107745.wav	So, how does a inductor and capacitor help us and how does the use of inductor and capacitor, along with the Op amp will hhelp us to form a LC oscillatorss	train
audio_0_11246.wav	So, 5 KVA	train
audio_0_77804.wav	30 days credit period we are giving but 60% of sales are collectible at the end of the current month 60% 30% of the sales will be collected by the end of next month and only 10% will go to the next to next month collection	train
audio_0_198126.wav	All of them are going to have almost similar characteristic because I am assuming that I am not including any extra resistance in the field circuit that is what I am assuming	train
audio_0_174046.wav	It is if you see the mesh analysis technique it is merely an extension of Kirchhoff's law	train
audio_0_24496.wav	right, Now, in case of mild steel an ideal curve is looks like this, right	train
audio_0_51726.wav	first	train
audio_0_206826.wav	It is supposed to be perpendicular to horizontal plane, but inclined to vertical plane that means, perpendicular, it can be a plane in that direction	train
audio_0_127007.wav	But then the problem as we shall see when we derive the expression for this GT it contains some terms which make the design of a network with pure GT difficult and therefore we will actually design with GT in mind but with some simplifications we shall see this later	train
audio_0_118408.wav	In the case of acceptors, the fermi level moves closer to the valence band	train
audio_0_215642.wav	Design collaborative group activities for learners and ask them to conduct peer review by providing them descriptive rubrics	train
audio_0_194416.wav	So let me start with actually the recalling of single phase AC circuits	train
audio_0_103710.wav	Our HY was 4550 kiloons whereas HA plus HB is almost 500 kiloons so that so the extra 50 kiloons is because of the additional effects that you have that is because of the eccentricity and the accidental eccentricity which is also built in from the design perspective	train
audio_0_14474.wav	Next will take the numerical; numericals are easy only thing is calculations should be correct for example	train
audio_0_165298.wav	One note is also given that bad debts recovered is not included in cash balance	train
audio_0_51317.wav	If you look back here this total field formulation all of this is happened this all of this happened on gamma itself outermost boundary right	train
audio_0_35099.wav	Even if you have these functions you do not always want to give these functions individually, because there might be some constraints between the values which have to be preserved and you can preserve those by controlling access to them	train
audio_0_5002.wav	So, there are 2 types of sources independent and dependent sources	train
audio_0_95687.wav	But what are the limitations of CV CV analysis so there are many limitations of the CV analysis number one is valuation problems I have already told you in the last class that there are different types of cost and benefits so the particular categories of cost and benefits also intangible cost and benefits that very much difficult to identify measure and quantify they cannot be quantified easily that is one of the most difficult problem in the most difficult challenge in case of cost benefit analysis that is intangible cost and the intangible benefits they are difficult to identify may be difficult to what measure and quantify another problem is known that the distortion problems there are two ways of distorting the results of CB analysis one there may be international favoritism of an alternative for the political reasons and two when the data are incomplete or they are missing from the analysis is very difficult to take an appropriate action and the next problem is a completeness problem here the cost related to CB analysis may be on the high side	train
audio_0_108763.wav	So, for designing the same circuit on the mMulti samesim, we will do the same thing and we will ask Sitaram to join us	train
audio_0_166558.wav	The first one we look at is the deadline monotonic algorithm, just a small variation of the rate monotonic algorithm and this we need to use when the task deadline and periods are different	train
audio_0_126605.wav	Then Gamma L will be given like this okay	train
audio_0_51156.wav	So, they are different and therefore, the radar cross section is going to be different	train
audio_0_85579.wav	Further, it is a cost that management believes should be incurred to produce a good or service under anticipatory conditions	train
audio_0_165967.wav	But then the worst case memory access time degrades because if the page is not available in memory, a page fault occurs and then it has to be obtained from the hard disk and the page faults incur significant latency	train
audio_0_48910.wav	So, there is some idea that the wave is somehow bending around obstacles and we are able to receive it this is in day to day life	train
audio_0_205615.wav	0 to 28	train
audio_0_205467.wav	So, then in that case the thread length 18 mm also has to be shown this is the 18 mm	train
audio_0_67791.wav	so here you are saying is that the process is essentially one of dividing a polynomial by another polynomial, and take the reminder that that will be the cyclic redundancy code and in in this case, our signature	train
audio_0_76619.wav	Warehouse, as I told you store and warehouse	train

audio_0_208991.wav	From today onwards, we will cover module number 3 with lecture number 21, Orthographic Projections	train
audio_0_124120.wav	So, let us see this example, so one problem in realising you see all the inductors and capacitors that we have discussed so far, we have considered them to be ideal	train
audio_0_46179.wav	So, we will keep this plus over here yeah that was a mistake of a minus sign no problem	train
audio_0_35469.wav	In the grid path thing there is one situation where you can illustrate this	train
audio_0_192448.wav	Finally, we will look at some starting methods	train
audio_0_203018.wav	This is also a voltage control current source	train
audio_0_35517.wav	This would be how internally, if you were to write a similar function, you would write it	train
audio_0_167681.wav	But then you might be wondering that why does it have to do so	train
audio_0_55003.wav	So on the electrical side these are the aspects that we have with us	train
audio_0_82863.wav	So you have to add this up	train
audio_0_113944.wav	The last operation is as follows it has a key this is known as the 10th round key and this 10th round key is xored with some intermediate state obtained from this during the encryption process to give you the cipher text, so thus what we will see in this attack is the attacker would be able to get one bit of this cipher text by injecting a fault	train
audio_0_159715.wav	But here we are not looking at payment or receipt	train
audio_0_173022.wav	So, what will do	train
audio_0_74316.wav	Here also $360,000 are going to be sales	train
audio_0_57922.wav	so you can write it as, like this: r is the radius divided by epsilon, and this can be easily done by e into four pi r square	train
audio_0_83530.wav	So if you take the balance here, so what is the balance here we have to take is that is coming up as 25,700s	train
audio_0_60285.wav	so what i should be writing in calculating this magnetic field is: curl of b is equal to mu naught j, free, where free is the current which is done from outside, plus mu naught curl of m	train
audio_0_71320.wav	of course there can be a some example you could be work out where this m, m, m method will give result which is better than this top down one, bottom of one	train
audio_0_73727.wav	So, it means this is the point where both the costs are equal and that is the point of minimum cost and that is the point of C also right	train
audio_0_24135.wav	7 tw okay thickness of web by 3 This is of flange so the torsional constant for flange and for web has been calculated and uhh is found as 11	train
audio_0_171852.wav	So, what you can write now if you see the equation vt is equal to vs plus v naught minus vs into e to the power minus t by tau	train
audio_0_179487.wav	Now you have Is, you have got the impulse response of the circuit what we have to do, we have to find the value of I naught at any time t with the help of convolution integral so what we will do now we will take the convolution of Is and h functions so what we can write we can write zero to t Is and will take the dummy variable as lambda so Is lambda h t minus lambda d lambda	train
audio_0_12111.wav	I mean as soon as the switch is closed, little bit understanding is required, you you apply here this your, what you call that your KVL	train
audio_0_134037.wav	That it as to refer to the specific data member of the class and it as allowed to do so	train
audio_0_136412.wav	These are not useful because I already have a point and I want to initialize another point	train
audio_0_5913.wav	So, Ohm’s law is the algebraic relationship between voltage and current for a resistor	train
audio_0_12670.wav	So, it is slope is equal to your 12 by 3 is equal to 4, the slope is equal to 4 for this straight line right	train
audio_0_192433.wav	So for example, if you look at mixer grinder, we use a single phase series motor which is actually known as universal motor	train
audio_0_16231.wav	So, ultimately it is 360 upon 358 ampere approximately 1 ampere that is i right	train
audio_0_175546.wav	So, basically the Laplace transform allows a signal represented by a time domain function to be analyzed in the s domain	train
audio_0_64951.wav	so do i have to look at the remaining n minus one numbers, if, if, if, they are n bit numbers	train
audio_0_156366.wav	So, what I am basically trying to tell you is that because the brain receives input from all sense modalities you can assume situations and you can very easily identify cases from the real world situation where your own experience will tell you that this part of my memory is basically guided by the input which has come from a given sense modality	train
audio_0_47016.wav	So, I am approximating a derivative by a finite difference right	train
audio_0_125696.wav	So for a given, suppose this is our smart chart and say the power gain circles that we obtained are like this	train
audio_0_123579.wav	So, we had three semiconductors, we looked at germanium, silicon and gallium arsenide	train
audio_0_10641.wav	This is your plus minus instantaneous polarity at this voltage is V Right	train
audio_0_210056.wav	So, the first thing what we can do is straight away, pick this right side view something like steps are visible	train
audio_0_32465.wav	So, it puts a between 4 and 5 and so on and now I can delete, for example if I delete 3 then I find that I have 1, 2, 4	train
audio_0_111312.wav	Now final point; it may not be final though	train
audio_0_86211.wav	if you talk about much more smaller system, nano, then you have to go to nems, nano electromechanical systems	train
audio_0_125554.wav	In the next module we shall be covering the case when they when we don’t have this unilateral figure of merit and then we shall that our choices are somewhat limited we cannot design it	train
audio_0_37646.wav	In this process what happen a lot of developmental problems	train
audio_0_35279.wav	Python has an intermediate scope called non local which says within g and h refer to the value inside f, but not to the value outside f	train
audio_0_139753.wav	We have learnt that there are public and private access specifiers which can be used to control who can access which part of the class	train
audio_0_203341.wav	So I will keep it simple and I will omit it for now, but please realize that it will simply appear in parallel with these two	train
audio_0_34568.wav	Now if we say nested 2 we get this list	train
audio_0_17615.wav	So like in 11th, 12th we have NCERT few books, and we know that these things are going to be important thing and we have to note these things whatever it is	train
audio_0_49970.wav	Grad phi	train
audio_0_129772.wav	And we have to take this into account otherwise without having everything normalized to the same amount, and we generally do that by making in parallel a thermogravimetric analysis to analyze the amount of bound water	train
audio_0_62512.wav	for example, if i take an inductor and we have seen, if i now try to establish the current through it, maybe through a switch, then what happens is there's a back e m f or e m f developed in the inductor, and this e m f is such that it opposes change, that is establishing it, and this is also therefore known as back e m f	train
audio_0_13549.wav	This ah ah this is 4 ampere and current source so, this current 4 ampere is entering here , right	train
audio_0_149931.wav	And this process is repeated in the next generation as well	train
audio_0_105559.wav	So, it can be focused easily, right this one	train
audio_0_205465.wav	So, from one end it is shown 22 mm this one	train
audio_0_155809.wav	39 and reactive load will be your node 2 and ah node 4 because 3 is compensated right	train
audio_0_32895.wav	Now we reach this point where we actually have to do some computation	train
audio_0_11506.wav	So, due to copper loss and iron loss, you add you that is 2	train
audio_0_114853.wav	So, what we do is we set a breakpoint in main and then when the breakpoint is hit, we do a disassemble setmylib int in GDB	train
audio_0_181323.wav	So, the voltage that we will apply across these two terminals will be equal to 100 volt and the current I will of course, be at that instant 10 milliampere	train
audio_0_215200.wav	Therefore, this principle is called used on screen agents or pedagogical agents to be able to help the learners be able to connect which the content much more easier	train
audio_0_66547.wav	and just another thing: you just see that suppose this gate is driving similar to other gates	train
audio_0_215151.wav	So, the best way to be able to solve such a problem and allow your students to be able to learn better is that you need to break this particular unit, this particular topic into smaller smaller chunks or smaller smaller blocks that will allow your students be able to learn better and this is how it can be done	train
audio_0_204338.wav	We have some extra components	train
audio_0_200695.wav	The source is virtually shorted to the gate, so the voltage at the source is VII, the current through this resistor has to be V	train
audio_0_74428.wav	But remaining 90% how we are going to collect	train
audio_0_59503.wav	now we can compare the dimensions	train
audio_0_155846.wav	But you have to see this right	train
audio_0_20683.wav	So the customer could be wherever they are and their vehicle could be better, we do not need the customer to come all the way to the workshop which is the root of the problem really, and that it is not the distance from customer location but distance that the customer travels	train
audio_0_23724.wav	So we have to calculate the different options and then we have to find out that which one is the most critical	train
audio_0_200160.wav	We use what is normally used for the mouse transistor which turns out to be like this	train
audio_0_4644.wav	And angle of impedance; that means, theta is positive because it is theta Y angle of admittance if angle of admittance become negative then angle of impedance theta will become positive right	train
audio_0_78763.wav	It means there is a variance of the cost and that variance of the cost is up to the say 4,000 rupees which is called as the negative variance	train
audio_0_3894.wav	So, V Thevenin is fixed R Thevenin is fixed only R L is changing	train
audio_0_79377.wav	Decision making depends upon how we make use of that information how that information becomes useful for us how it is relevant for us so in the previous class i emphasized upon that they are the different tools and techniques where we can say use them for important decision making or for the different managerial decisions or say decisions to be taken by the say management of the different firms different business organizations and we discuss that cost sheet is a one such statement which is normally prepared under the cost accounting but the information provided by the cost sheet can be used by the managers for taking the strategic decisions very useful decisions right so we discussed the structure of the cost sheet that how the cost sheet can be prepared what it includes and what different type of the sub cost it works out because we have to I mean say find out the total cost of the product and in this competitive world our cost has to be as low as possible I was talking to in the previous class also the same thing that our cost has to be as low as possible	train
audio_0_67026.wav	now this jtag eleven, fourteen and dot one standard this has been extended also in a number of different ways, like there has been and analog boundary scan version, a test standard which which allows also analog signals to be fed to a circuit	train

audio_0_212998.wav	And there is another important object which we call toolbar	train
audio_0_141022.wav	So basically, you are not supplying those values	train
audio_0_126148.wav	So, let us discuss a little bit more about couplers	train
audio_0_108238.wav	This is what we have done	train
audio_0_149665.wav	And this was given by Hermann Ebbinghaus	train
audio_0_136362.wav	So, now, it will get this call of the destructor for c param	train
audio_0_212472.wav	Now, this new view whatever we got that becomes the true shape	train
audio_0_61061.wav	it should give me correct a, correct ah, magnetic field b	train
audio_0_170462.wav	So, loudness of volume between softness and loudness can differentiate in correlation often with a lax or tense facial musculature and gesture perfectly congruent with the internal muscular effort	train
audio_0_5624.wav	So, the direction of flux I told you the right hand rule, I will just explain you, you go through it whatever I said, same thing it everything it is here	train
audio_0_47854.wav	So, in other words, this is a material that reacts instantaneously to the incident radiation because the response is	train
audio_0_176213.wav	so, let us assume that the there is another component called time constant and it is denoted by lower case Greek letter which we generally say as tau so, let us say that this time constant tau is nothing but, the value of R into C so, if you put the value of tau in the circuit, the voltage V will become V Naught into e to the power minus t by tau	train
audio_0_100961.wav	However remember that any of these correlations are empirical and which would mean given the variability of masonry these empirical coefficients can also be different	train
audio_0_42541.wav	So, stability I have got, but is my answer correct that is the next question that is that is meant by convergence ok	train
audio_0_103209.wav	So this is an additional check that you would make, that you have the area of shear reinforcement that you are estimating and then ensure that the vertical, in the vertical direction, the minimum cross section area of reinforcement that you have provided is at least one third of the value that you are providing for the shear reinforcement itself	train
audio_0_105635.wav	When you balanced your op amp, not bias balance, your op amp, then the small amount of current that you find, right	train

audio_0_138305.wav	Now the interesting thing is that C data possibly is 1 byte here, which means that it can contain up to 255 the value incidentally that you have given to the 4 bytes of int happens to be less than 255	train
audio_0_42606.wav	Like we did in volume integral how did we	train
audio_0_26609.wav	Similarly bending stress we are getting 6mm by 3d square which is 138 MPa and permissible is 227 MPa so it is safe	train
audio_0_175825.wav	So, the value of voltage source would become 2 into 4 that is 8i x and the direction of plus sign the polarity would be plus would be in the direction of flow of the current so that is why the below sign is plus up sign is minus and then in series with one 4 ohm resistance	train
audio_0_40024.wav	So, when I am reduce make delta z make it delta z by 2 what happens to my error	train

audio_0_109041.wav	So, even at V G S equals to 0 that is in depletion type that is a channel between source and drain	train
audio_0_2291.wav	So, this is equation 2 this is equation 2 right, may be made variable in order to obtain resonance, now solving equation 1; that means,rather than I will say equation1 or equation2 rather than I will say equation two from equation1 we got equation2 so, you will get omega 0 is equal to 1 upon root over I mean what you do is you from this	train
audio_0_178772.wav	So your figure will look like as shown in the slide where the input port is short circuited in that case your V 1 will become 0 and I 2 is connected to the output port	train

audio_0_5894.wav	It is resistivity it is ohm meter	train
audio_0_125121.wav	And these 2 loops do not touch each other, so then they become non teaching loops	train
audio_0_125031.wav	So these are n sections of transmission lines cascaded with each other	train
audio_0_200544.wav	Then we go to another variety of MOS transistor known as P MOS transistor and try to make circuits using the P MOS transistor	train
audio_0_61745.wav	however, the net charge is going to be finite and you can see that very easily	train
audio_0_49256.wav	Let us write everything in terms of local edges first ok	train

audio_0_102326.wav	So, as a typology, masonry because of load bearing walls gives you the possibility of low axial stress ratios	train
audio_0_70007.wav	so there is some kind of a shielding, so the noise on these lines will not propagate to the next signal line because of the shielding	train
audio_0_149416.wav	In fact, you start repeating only those behavior which you realize, were reinforced by the environment behavior which was not reinforced by the environment you actually started curtailing on that you reduced reflecting such type of responses in life	train
audio_0_159574.wav	Now, the liability is there is certain, but the amount is still being decided	train
audio_0_213281.wav	So, from p point draw a projected line p' q', which is 60 mm PQ is 60 mm long, so 60 mm and it is parallel to this XY axis and 15 mm it is from both horizontal plane and vertical plane also	train
audio_0_108032.wav	Now, if you see that we will have close loop amplifier	train

audio_0_111617.wav	So, can we it is already connected to 220 volts	train
audio_0_217080.wav	it is obvious this node knows to whom he sending, he knows to whom he is communicating both ways here	train
audio_0_112311.wav	Both are multimeters	train
audio_0_206484.wav	For example, I would like to have a height of 50 millimeters	train
audio_0_71126.wav	this will be connected here	train
audio_0_18563.wav	I think that is pretty much it	train

audio_0_14639.wav	So, this is actually i 2 this is taken like this right suppose it is leaving the dot	train
audio_0_33585.wav	So, what we need to do is now with the new board we have to place one more queen	train
audio_0_65926.wav	so there is v one, v two and v three	train
audio_0_133073.wav	So, that is the simple thing	train
audio_0_49580.wav	So, that is actually even scarier because you will get some answer for it and you think it exists, but under underneath the hood it does not exist there is a special technique of modifying quadrature rules when you know that there is a singularity inside it is called singularity extraction ok	train
audio_0_168495.wav	Hedwig Lewis has described body language as “the communication of personal feelings, emotions, attitudes and thoughts through body movements; gestures, postures, positions and distances either consciously or involuntarily, more often subconsciously and accompanied or unaccompanied by the spoken language”	train

audio_0_46265.wav	Answer is going to be yes because I have put this hypothetical current over here Ms Js ok	train
audio_0_48082.wav	So, we need not worry how we got this equation right; mechanics has given this equation to us which is the second order differential equation right	train
audio_0_45160.wav	So, the big leap of faith is going to be that everywhere in my right hand side this expression over here	train
audio_0_57817.wav	then temperature inside the time doesn't change with time because it has a stabilize	train
audio_0_19872.wav	So, he was perplexed and he took the problem back to the Royal British Navy and they examined it and probably took it back to Sir Humphry Davy himself and Humphry said, oops	train
audio_0_107115.wav	Oxygen or water vapor flows through the reactor and pass the silicon wafers with typical velocity of 1 centimeter per second	train
audio_0_73931.wav	So, it means it is weekly balance equal to maximum 1 week’s balance firm is keeping as a cash remaining is being invested into the securities	train
audio_0_121225.wav	So, graded compositions help to achieve that because they give you the wave the change in the band gap, while at the same time allowing you to grow epitaxial layers	train
audio_0_194420.wav	So whenever we have a sinusoidal voltage rather than using that as a sign quantity, let us say this is t, if I am writing this with respect to time I have to add and subtract sinusoidal quantities, I have to multiply, I have to differentiate, integrate, all of them needs to be done on this sinusoidal quantity because I am sure fundamental elements in an electric circuit you guys know so V equal to Ri, this is corresponding to resistance I can write L di by dt equal to V, this is with reference to inductance C dv by dt equal to current, this is with reference to capacitance	train
audio_0_54426.wav	Therefore, for the purposes of documentation, this ENG spice plot is not very comfortable, I would say	train
audio_0_200061.wav	V O gets connected to that and the input terminals of the op amp also get connected to that	train
audio_0_153293.wav	So, we here we cannot get any steady state block diagram because of this is if we can put S is equal to 0, but here you cannot do that	train
audio_0_74969.wav	So, the balance of the loan, loan payable is that is 45,000 is the balance of the loan	train

audio_0_22034.wav	2 we have discussed already that means it is a concentric loading what we have designed earlier in case of compression member may be that member it may be channel section maybe I section maybe other type of section when it is concentrically loaded then the design formula which I have already already discussed that formula will be used which is given in clause 7	train
audio_0_180608.wav	So, therefore, this point is at 0 volt ok	train
audio_0_177670.wav	So, these 2 would be considered as a source which provide current to the circuit	train
audio_0_106487.wav	And rest of the area will not be retained, the area which is transparent, which is white, will not be retained	train
audio_0_116759.wav	This is done by this statement where the contents of the global variable mylib int is stored in the EAX register	train

audio_0_54184.wav	V0 would be the average value of this	train
audio_0_174817.wav	So, how our circuit will look like	train
audio_0_191479.wav	I am operating this at rated speed, so if it is a 220 volts machine or something like that may be then I am applying the rated value of field current which is corresponding to rated flux, I will get 220 volts as the value of voltage, so this is going to be rated voltage	train
audio_0_119758.wav	So, in this case, Io is known, I1000 is known, this is the short circuit current at thousand which is 2 times the short circuit at 500, and we just calculated it	train
audio_0_104367.wav	It's only the uncracked zone that's actually going to be actively participating in stress distribution	train

audio_0_139713.wav	This pointer this is actually a keyword in C++, and this is a name	train
audio_0_18097.wav	Okay, so, I wonder what connection these caves, these set of caves, have, with design thinking	train
audio_0_176677.wav	So, because of this t you will see a ramp at time t is equal to 1 you will get the value of ramp as 1	train
audio_0_59746.wav	so so as long as you are not sitting on the charge, the divergence of the field is zero	train
audio_0_193595.wav	And when we are looking at filed system it can be actually the stationary portion or it can be the rotational portion, no problem	train
audio_0_129205.wav	So very few literature has actually reported observing ettringite at pH levels of below 9, okay	train
audio_0_103765.wav	It is not direct compression but flexual compression and this is the basis that we use for the failure criterion	train
audio_0_182101.wav	Now, the goal of this video is to measure this charge which has flown during an impulsive current in a circuit using a galvanometer which you called a ballistic galvanometer	train
audio_0_133664.wav	So, in the whole of C program, irrespective of how many files in which you write and so on, but in the whole of the program that will run as one unit from call to one main, every function name has to be distinct, every function name	train
audio_0_214842.wav	Will that ensure that learning actually happens where this e learning	train
audio_0_179756.wav	So, the circuit which is modified and we place the voltage source in such a way that it is the current coming out of the voltage sources in the same direction and we short circuit the current I these segment where the voltage source was connected and we found that the value of I is same as it was there in the previous case	train
audio_0_167922.wav	What you see here on the investors face is just the two lips going upwards	train
audio_0_19970.wav	Again the moral of the story here is don’t jump to solutions at the first insight itself	train
audio_0_148474.wav	4 is 0 1 0 0	train

audio_0_52279.wav	In the surface integral, I have two Green’s function	train
audio_0_138333.wav	So, it is a variable whose value is a memory address	train
audio_0_37716.wav	So, there is a whole mess which is going on, actually nobody stopped them thought about all these things	train
audio_0_102612.wav	You might lie somewhere there or you might lie somewhere there but which means that your estimates can actually overlap	train
audio_0_186567.wav	However in multi brand retailing FDI is not allowed in India now	train
audio_0_114619.wav	So, soon after the call gets invoked the next instruction has the address 08048454	train
audio_0_10478.wav	So, this is figure 22 right	train
audio_0_64698.wav	now, you see, earlier, when we talked about the traditional routing, there, our main criteria was to minimize the wire length	train
audio_0_54988.wav	So this is an EE type of core	train
audio_0_101530.wav	So n into t by 6 will be the cracking moment in the cross section where your sigma minimum goes to 0 and sigma max is now the maximum stress in a triangular distribution	train
audio_0_171003.wav	If we have actually touched something or we have experienced something with our hands, then this becomes a significant interpretation of the scenario in comparison to various versions which we might have heard from others	train
audio_0_150871.wav	So, that is why that is why responding to the control impulses later I will come chases the load with the transient unbalance of load and generation reflected in speed or frequency variation because if ah this is a question to you, I am putting it you will answer it that if real power, if real power increases there will be a decrease in frequency in the decrease of the ah speed of the ah your moved in to ah your generate a turbines set at the power system right because generate a turbine coupled together	train
audio_0_16141.wav	So, with respect to the ground; so, this is there is no electrical element	train
audio_0_111298.wav	That is why everything is interrelated	train
audio_0_68914.wav	so this will be the best cut	train
audio_0_51709.wav	Constant r constant	train
audio_0_165895.wav	different tasks arise with different periods and we will discuss about the multi rate cyclic executive and how does it handle these different types of tasks and help to meet their deadline	train
audio_0_76007.wav	So, in that case, now we will have to find out the standard time and then the actual time but we have to work out the standard time by taking this total time as 1 880 and then proportionately say distributing it among us the skilled, semi skilled and the unskilled workers	train
audio_0_112140.wav	So, we will also see how what is the equipment used to measure this capacitor, there is the capacitance of this particular device	train
audio_0_62877.wav	ok, so the types of routing regions can be either ah, horizontal channel, which is parallel to the x axis with the pins corresponding to the nets at that top and bottom boundaries	train
audio_0_152353.wav	And we know that X is equal to magnitude of course, one upon omega C and this one is equal to 307	train
audio_0_150570.wav	So, delta F will remain same, but this your generator ah sharing power sharing will be different	train
audio_0_46519.wav	So, this was weighted residual and this is and as we discussed earlier this weak form is useful because it involves only first order derivatives	train
audio_0_125854.wav	Before discussing this, this type of filter let me a slight diversion and let us just try to establish what is this concept of image impedance	train
audio_0_54853.wav	So this would complete the electrical design of the capacitance	train
audio_0_211000.wav	Now, if I draw it very long length, then it shows only one kind of arrow	train
audio_0_208423.wav	This B B 1 will also be visible when we are looking from side view	train
audio_0_85391.wav	So, we will see how we can utilize this amount	train
audio_0_215402.wav	As you are seeing here though one of the left in title blooms taxonomy is based on the original work of Benjamin blooms and others in 1956 as I attempted to define the functions of thought on cognition	train
audio_0_132781.wav	So, at this point, you will have a call to the destructor of D	train
audio_0_180165.wav	We are only considering whether it is when it is high, when it is slow, how will it will oscillate	train
audio_0_176993.wav	What is N, N is the total number of branches connected to that particular node where we are analysing the circuit or you can say that it is total number of branches coming in or out from a particular closed boundary	train
audio_0_15307.wav	This is your E 1 it can be represent by K V 2 voltage across the load	train
audio_0_68392.wav	so i have this p mos, c mos, this ground, this v dd	train
audio_0_129431.wav	Now we will this clinker has to go into the cement and will see what is the inventory for each cement	train
audio_0_176889.wav	Now let us take one example to understand the properties which we discussed like linearity and the additivity and homogeneity	train
audio_0_204357.wav	By design we made this entire thing become equal to 3 volts	train
audio_0_85639.wav	So, how much is the total actual cost	train
audio_0_52031.wav	Now, it seems that if I want more and more accuracy then I should evaluate my function at more points right; for the if I want to fit a parabola I need more points then if I want to fit a line right	train
audio_0_65719.wav	so what we do one possible heuristic that has been proposed is something like this: you consider the complete partitioning graph, you identify all complex triangles that exists there, you select one edge from each of those complex triangles and in each of edges you add one edge, which means it is something like this: let say, your complex triangle look like this	train
audio_0_214562.wav	Also the learning activities should be designed to enable the students to achieve these learning outcomes	train
audio_0_146431.wav	Firstly, this is the LED	train
audio_0_176450.wav	So these two are the same equations which we represented initially to define the h parameters	train
audio_0_205534.wav	1 mm to 24	train
audio_0_71196.wav	take the average, you take the four x coordinates: two, two, four, four	train
audio_0_161516.wav	See, mark the sign also, it's a negative because it's a profit to us	train
audio_0_4498.wav	Now, if you think in terms of power factor P ab is equal to V ab I ab cos theta V ab 44	train
audio_0_32483.wav	We have rstrip, which we used for example to remove the trailing whitespace backslash n in our lines, and we had lstrip to remove leading whitespace, and we had strip which removes it on both directions	train
audio_0_118281.wav	We won’t look at entire periodic table, but focus ourselves in the area where we have the groups four, three and five	train
audio_0_139331.wav	So, that whole block of statements is a compound one you can see an example at the bottom	train
audio_0_63816.wav	the size of the grid, cells are appropriately defined so that wires for different nets can be routed through adjacent cells	train
audio_0_106881.wav	So, the this is your supply current, there are lower Op Amps available that run on less than 10 micro ampere usually the faster Op amp runs on more power, it is obvious it is obvious	train
audio_0_70360.wav	so the fault free value of d zero and fault free value of the output is also	train
audio_0_56554.wav	But, what I give you is I hide that spherical body, I give you that on this surface the field is all the same on this spherical surface and it is magnitude is given by some constant	train
audio_0_177971.wav	So, now you have got all the nodes which are required to represent the signal flow graph	train
audio_0_64267.wav	g is the total number of gates in combinational logic, plus if n	train
audio_0_115612.wav	In the next lecture we will look at more into detail about the free function call essentially how free deallocates the allocated memory and how the link list are managed and in particular we will actually look at the ways to exploit this internal aspects of malloc and how to actually create an attack on this scene	train
audio_0_67259.wav	so with this we come to the end of the lecture	train
audio_0_47738.wav	Excited with all frequencies right; so, that is well all frequencies is technically impossible white band right	train
audio_0_175520.wav	Similarly for resistance dual that is conductance will also be connected between node 2 and node 3, now next what we have left with is the capacitance value that is between this side to this side of the circuit, which current is flowing here	train
audio_0_102432.wav	Now this criterion is what you would, this failure mode is what you would link with in the Manmuller criterion where we had the failure of the motor joint	train
audio_0_61987.wav	this add it to the previous expression will give me the total energy, and let us do that	train
audio_0_52173.wav	So, let us take an example, a popular kind of implementation of a current source ok	train
audio_0_208687.wav	Here, we have a 3 dimensional object and this we would like to produce it on the drawing sheet for different views, to do that first of all let us look at the object	train
audio_0_213705.wav	And, in that edges which are the vertices and in those vertices what are the x y information	train
audio_0_128508.wav	And then over here we can see the different other populations and we can see that these are evolved over time	train
audio_0_70510.wav	so here we shall see how fault lists are propagated	train
audio_0_112649.wav	You see fast rising spike	train
audio_0_33052.wav	Now, if you ask me to show what scores looks like, we see that it has an outer dictionary with two keys test 1, test 2 each of which is a nested dictionary	train
audio_0_199252.wav	So, that part is satisfied	train
audio_0_210048.wav	So, that length is D	train
audio_0_38052.wav	We are not sensitive to what the child would	train
audio_0_26646.wav	So if I put this equation so stress due to bending moment will be 10	train
audio_0_174145.wav	So, on the other end, we can now say that, we draw the maximum power possible power from the voltage source by drawing the maximum possible current	train
audio_0_126684.wav	First was this bias, how to bias a circuit, then how to operate	train
audio_0_48248.wav	So, rho was the unknown and ah, so the first step was to find rho and to find rho what did we do	train
audio_0_18574.wav	So that is, this activity is positively affecting them in terms of the marks that they are scoring	train
audio_0_150272.wav	Now, in TAT for interpretation purpose the focus is laid on basically three areas the content of the story the feeling or tone of the story	train
audio_0_115530.wav	So, if you look in the ptmalloc code and into the structure called malloc state you would see that there is an instantiation of heap info which would actually be a pointer to a particular heap	train
audio_0_40300.wav	So, this was a very quick run through of volume integral equations I went a little fast because we know all the building blocks	train
audio_0_38285.wav	They were fighting for property and see the amount of misery which would have happened at that time; continuously they were in trouble, they were hardly in the period of peace and happiness	train
audio_0_126851.wav	So this DZ is not there	train
audio_0_17547.wav	Devdat, basically we are working on solution towards IT and looking at how, where people write, what activities go in and around writing, basically	train
audio_0_16215.wav	It will be it will becoming 360 by 13 volt right that is my V Thevenin 360 by 13 volt	train
audio_0_108760.wav	So, this is how you can you can increase the voltage height and in the input signal or decrease voltage in the input signal and try to see how you can how you can design the peak detector	train
audio_0_36339.wav	When we use the word processor to type a document or even when we use our cell phones to type sms messages, the computer suggests correction in our spelling	train
audio_0_121381.wav	So, this could be in the visible region or in the infrared or UV you also have a case where you shine light on to a material and get an output in the form of an electric current	train
audio_0_39109.wav	So, I have to put the corresponding ISR in the you have to put the corresponding ISR in the vector address 1 3; so, this is done	train
audio_0_124354.wav	For a microstrip line that we were discussing we have found out what is an E effective and for a microstrip line that is the value of Z 0 is often given by this formula where epsilon effective as we found was equal to epsilon 0 C upon C 0	train
audio_0_108367.wav	iIf you see, there is plus 15 volts, 2 ampere, common, minus 15 volts, 2 ampere, which is similar to what we haved seen earlier	train
audio_0_101010.wav	There are two surfaces, upper surface and lower surface together which is the shear area, you will be able to estimate the shear stress corresponding to a certain level of axial compressive stress	train
audio_0_176559.wav	So, that is the sudden injection of current into the circuit	train
audio_0_107839.wav	So, what we are asked	train
audio_0_67596.wav	so in green, whatever i have shown, you are actually getting actual arrival times of the signal transitions at every node	train
audio_0_35841.wav	In other words, I can now write the following definition, I can say that the longest common the length of the longest common subword l c w starting from i j	train
audio_0_112968.wav	So, that is the reason of teaching you what is Physical Vapor Deposition and how we can how we can use the physical body position for MOSFETs alright	train
audio_0_162372.wav	The efficiency of use of inventory had increased a bit	train
audio_0_137706.wav	And when it does, then you really have a problem because there is no way to solve that other than using the initialization list	train
audio_0_200209.wav	Let me copy over this circuit	train
audio_0_78046.wav	steel in the western part of the country and the gendals steel in the western part of the country, Bijanag steel plant in I think in Karnataka	train
audio_0_165944.wav	At this point an interrupt occurs	train
audio_0_40796.wav	Go to quadratic, but what you need more there I mean what more do you need then	train
audio_0_106789.wav	One terminal is ground with respect to the second terminal right	train
audio_0_67303.wav	but if i have a flexible block where i know that there are six pins i need, but their exact locations are not fixed, they can move around	train
audio_0_101497.wav	So, in this particular case, you have a superimposed load acting on the wall and then the self weight of the wall, self weight of the wall above the crack as the compressive stress into the net area that is being considered into x by H and the part below which is the rest of the wall itself	train
audio_0_200252.wav	You identify the capacitor, you identify the resistor across it and make sure that the capacitive reactance is much more than the resistive	train
audio_0_190995.wav	And every time when I align and realign these domains, I am doing some work physically or the current and voltage are doing some work physically on these domains which is actually manifested in the form of some amount of energy that is lost because this energy is you know just useless	train
audio_0_41564.wav	So, this is the challenge of this problem and	train
audio_0_104398.wav	So section 0 or other sections between section 11 and the 0 0 should possibly have a situation of cracking	train
audio_0_155526.wav	Now, in the second case the new power factor require can be found as that cos theta 2 new right is equal to P upon S T; P we know 6942 kilowatt and S T is 7200 kVA	train
audio_0_65931.wav	so this has become zero	train

audio_0_137762.wav	That is the default automatic behavior	train
audio_0_38841.wav	So, it is active input pin and it is active high; so normally it is active low, but we must hold it for two machine cycles for getting it active sensed	train
audio_0_67870.wav	this output will be ab, x or gate	train
audio_0_115655.wav	Now further execution from this location would result in a segmentation fault because this is an invalid location	train

audio_0_130491.wav	And we see here now that what happens as you increase the amounts of CSA, you see the increase in super saturation	train
audio_0_117319.wav	So this could mean that the program will execute until line number 10 and then it will wait for further action	train
audio_0_190955.wav	So Ef corresponds to the induced EMF corresponding to your revolving magnetic field created by the rotor	train
audio_0_34132.wav	There are some shortcuts which are easy to remember and use; very often you want to take the first n characters in the string, then you could omit the 0, and just say start implicitly from 0, so just leave it out, so just start say colon and j	train
audio_0_109162.wav	So, yellow and blue are the input and output, and you can see that the output is following the input	train

audio_0_192698.wav	Here there will be two windings shifted from each other by 90 degrees	train
audio_0_142660.wav	So, the limited broad disclosure without disclosing the details of how it is being done should work as a strategic disclosure for instance for getting into a joint venture agreement or to bring a partner or funding for the university	train
audio_0_117522.wav	What are the instructions are available for supporting these features	train
audio_0_181591.wav	So, everywhere in this equation wherever I have I, I will just put minus I ok	train
audio_0_10555.wav	So, at the load the complex power absorb is, so S load is equal to 3 I p square into Z p if it is a balanced system, so I p square Z p per phase into 3 right	train
audio_0_106706.wav	If you remember these points it has these are repeated in several paths when we talk about the operational amplifier ok	train
audio_0_154801.wav	Therefore, a lightning flash may have a single stroke or a sequence of several discrete stroke; as many as 40 it can happen, separated by about 40 millisecond as shown in figure 15; so this is actually figure 15; so dart leader, return stroke; everything is shown	train
audio_0_33575.wav	So, with such a data structure this is the outline of how our strategy works	train
audio_0_86230.wav	so this is just for your understanding sake	train
audio_0_101478.wav	What we are actually doing is for the deflected shape, considering the deflected shape, we are looking at in the deflected profile, what is the point at which the, in the deflected profile, what is the point at which the in the deflected form where is the gravity force acting and at what eccentricity is it with respect to the base cross section, inner edge of the base cross section	train
audio_0_127204.wav	Then I found out that here the B in is equal to J 1	train
audio_0_157385.wav	Now you have an unexpected event, you just think what is it	train
audio_0_40312.wav	So, here in this Green's function r m is being held constant because the region of integration is I mean the variable of integration is my prime coordinate	train
audio_0_16595.wav	Otherwise that 50 percent energy missing if you had considered that you should have found actually ah it is here in the parasitic inductances right that because it is missing means; that means, some where it has gone ; that means, some where it is stored	train
audio_0_20574.wav	So you can be analytical about this and actually do a plot and see if it actually matches up	train
audio_0_210469.wav	For example, here the material element is different, the sectional area is different; the sectional area is different, the sectional area is different	train
audio_0_118326.wav	So, in the case of silicon, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are at different values of k; top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band have different values of k	train
audio_0_65584.wav	so what you can do, you can use another layer	train
audio_0_126434.wav	Here once again Gamma represents the propagation constant and Z0 is what is known as the characteristic impedance	train
audio_0_119630.wav	So, we now have a situation where instead of doubling the photon intensity reducing it by half	train
audio_0_113812.wav	As we have seen before the cache memories could be very abstractly represented by this particular figure	train
audio_0_139484.wav	And therefore, the class D can actually invoke that function on an object instance and certainly this function will get added	train
audio_0_178815.wav	So, you can say that I 1 is nothing but V 1 minus V naught by 8	train
audio_0_138613.wav	So, this is the module out line for both the module 36 as well as module 37, certainly the blue part is what we do in this current module and that will be available on the left of your screen also the slides	train
audio_0_176950.wav	So in that case volt is V2 you will get as 8 volt and finally using super position theorem what you can say the total voltage	train
audio_0_147075.wav	But all these things are really not required, you need to understand better about the parameter you are trying to control in an application and then you can select an appropriate method of control	train
audio_0_213638.wav	Here a picture of bridge is shown, if you look at carefully it contains many line elements, it looks like a wireframe	train

audio_0_104926.wav	Then we have seen photolithography and its process	train
audio_0_132117.wav	But the advantage is, if we define a constructor then as soon as the control will pass this particular point that is when the object gets instantiated immediately an automatic call an implicit call will happen to this method, and that call will make sure that top is indeed assign to minus 1	train
audio_0_38742.wav	So, it is connected to this transistor gate of this transistor; so, gate of the transistor getting 0, so this transistor is turned off	train
audio_0_57472.wav	so the equations that i have is: partial e y over partial x is equal to minus d, b z over d t and partial b z over partial x is equal to minus mu, zero, epsilon, zero, d, e, y by d t	train
audio_0_33040.wav	With the same first key for example, with the same different first key for example, test 1 and test 2; you could keep track of two different scores for Dhawan	train
audio_0_2432.wav	So, in general if we take first condition that XL minus XC is equal to R ultimately mod XL minus mod XC is equal to actually R right	train
audio_0_157742.wav	Which will help you recollect your events the memory of the evnt rather than whether you where able to complete it or it was not completed	train
audio_0_114506.wav	Therefore, after the function gets completes its execution which we will see as in the code	train
audio_0_45170.wav	So, now, n hat is here and the wave is hitting non normally, but what approximation am I doing	train
audio_0_110480.wav	So, now if Vo equals to Ad into Vd plus Acm into Vcm; if I take AdVd as common, then finally, I will get an equation which is similar to this	train
audio_0_208104.wav	This is the way we show it	train
audio_0_200437.wav	So if you see the C1 is connected between this terminal A and terminal B	train
audio_0_174149.wav	It will be achieved simply by sorting the terminals because only at that condition the maximum current would be delivered by the source	train
audio_0_111874.wav	You see intensity of the signal focus	train
audio_0_124122.wav	And if we have an ideal C in shunt, then we can also go a long clockwise direction in the Y Smith chart	train
audio_0_101528.wav	From this we can then take it to the limiting case where we said that the limiting case is when you have tension cropping into the cross section	train
audio_0_46368.wav	If I want so I mean the hint I am trying to lead you towards is change of variables, is there a change of variables that can map the 2 triangles to each other this what I am asking	train

audio_0_51782.wav	Now, we had a discussion on boundary conditions and we have seen that the for example, the radiation boundary condition we have used its in exact	train
audio_0_23644.wav	4 kilonewton due to tensile as 179	train
audio_0_76726.wav	This is the 19,000	train
audio_0_206814.wav	The additional planes of projection other than three principal planes of projections that is of a front view, top view and right side or left side views, which will show true lengths are called these auxiliary planes	train
audio_0_59286.wav	therefore, a x at r is going to be equal to mu zero over four pi integral of j x r prime over r minus r prime d v prime	train
audio_0_45576.wav	So, at this grid point what do I do	train
audio_0_175129.wav	So summer is basically used for either adding or subtracting the variables	train
audio_0_140727.wav	And with that you should minimize on, if actually I would advice that you completely remove any use of C style casting in your code, just rely on these cast operators	train
audio_0_216402.wav	So, this course we will not focus too much on the develop phase maybe a little bit and almost not at all on the implement and evaluate; actually a little bit on the evaluate, but not so much on the implement, but we just for completion sake of completeness, we will go through these phases	train
audio_0_6726.wav	Similarly here directly you will get it what will be i 2; i 2 will be your basically if you add 6 2 and 8 all are in series	train
audio_0_163619.wav	You realize that A is able to make a profit of 65 on sales of 650	train
audio_0_36728.wav	Now this is often the case when we need to optimize implementation, we might come up with an inefficient implementation and then optimize it	train
audio_0_80284.wav	So, out of 3875 adverse variance, to the extent of 2187	train
audio_0_172709.wav	Now, what procedure we followed previously we will just use that procedure	train
audio_0_148513.wav	ARM7 was one of the previous generation microcontrollers	train
audio_0_39542.wav	So, its e is equal to 1 and for e is equal to 1 that is this guy which is at the left or right node	train
audio_0_197831.wav	So this is going to be I line	train
audio_0_146265.wav	It essentially saves r14 and some other registers which I may be needing	train
audio_0_108586.wav	It is in AC mode, we can we can see the change, right	train
audio_0_111882.wav	First position is for the channel one, second position is for channel 2	train
audio_0_177620.wav	Now if you see the circuit these two legs are in parallel so you can further simplify then The parallel combination of 5 and 3 plus j 4 will be simplified to say Z1	train
audio_0_199665.wav	So, this is a very important distinction	train
audio_0_79712.wav	Total number of hours is the labor, actual number of hours is 2,000 and this is the one component and you multiply by the rate here rate given to us is 20 14 and 10 so it means if you multiply this 400 600 and 1,000 by 20 14 and 10 this will become the actual cost of the labor so this one component will be answered that is the finding out this component that is the actual cost of the labor is not difficult at all	train
audio_0_175407.wav	We will discuss few more parameters in the next few lectures	train
audio_0_63600.wav	we assumed that interconnection delays are negligible as compare to the gate delay	train
audio_0_133963.wav	Now what will happen, if I add a and b enum as you know is the sub range of int, so if I try to add one enum with another naturally there is no separate addition of operation for enum	train
audio_0_172518.wav	So we will consider the c s plus point and b s minus so Vcb will be the potential across the potential coil because we consider b as a reference point for the connection of the watt meter coils	train
audio_0_189714.wav	So, essentially what the attacker is going to do is that he is going to change this return address the valid return address present in the stack with a pointer to an attack code	train
audio_0_141268.wav	Then the next is you will have to consider the effect of casting on the operands, certainly since we have not discussed about casting I am not in a position to elaborate more on this, but while you discuss casting we will refer back on this	train
audio_0_110038.wav	This is another cross section is the same thing right just the material is different	train
audio_0_5677.wav	Because, we will go for mean your what you call assuming that is uniform cross section, so your mean follow the mean flux path	train
audio_0_55336.wav	Now this scan	train
audio_0_105952.wav	We are measuring the output of the differentiator so, as you can see on the screen right	train
audio_0_103351.wav	So, the work of providing lateral restraint to such constructions again comes back to these massive peripheral walls	train
audio_0_52578.wav	So, that is why doctors will say do not get too many X rays done you know you know given period of time, because the more you expose to X rays the more the genetic mutation can happen	train
audio_0_148279.wav	So, for communication we can also use Bluetooth, radio communication or near field communication	train
audio_0_152267.wav	So, if you take tan theta 1 that is tan 49	train
audio_0_137667.wav	That is a beautiful understanding	train
audio_0_169072.wav	It is convenient of course, it is quick also it saves time and it is cost effective also	train
audio_0_103086.wav	If the compression level were to approach the crushing strength of masonry, under the action of lateral forces and gravity you will have flexural compression failure	train
audio_0_16866.wav	I showed you and power and energy right	train

audio_0_167154.wav	So, this indicates that the frame size squarely divides the major cycle	train
audio_0_43309.wav	What did we do rather	train
audio_0_44077.wav	Cancelled or equal to the scattered field inside the object that does not mean that the field inside is 0, it just tells you that this balance of these impressed currents as they called is such that outside the object it produces the correct field; inside the object it cancels the incident field	train
audio_0_100807.wav	So the flat testing, there are two types of flat jack testing you will appreciate the differences between the two types of testing depending on what you are actually looking for from the structure	train
audio_0_47319.wav	So, if I give you two vectors over here say a and b with some angle theta between them ,we all know the inner product of these two vectors is; what would you write it as	train
audio_0_194098.wav	So the other winding if I show again a dot here that means if I call this as positive with respect to this, this will also be positive with respect to this	train
audio_0_173307.wav	In case of force current analogy the number of displacements will be equal to number of node voltages	train

audio_0_10181.wav	Just for the purpose of your that giving you some feeling that they are waveform right	train
audio_0_34493.wav	So, we cannot say that 'i' has the type int forever; 'i' will have a type depending on what it is assigned	train
audio_0_5796.wav	So, K h is characteristic constant of your core material, n is equal to Steinmetz exponent, range 1	train
audio_0_147522.wav	We show that same plot on the left	train
audio_0_60470.wav	i can write this as a delta r minus x, not x	train
audio_0_51788.wav	So, you now know the field on those points ok	train
audio_0_140959.wav	So, you should always separate this out that headers which are common functions, macros, constants, manifest constants that are to be shared between source files	train
audio_0_208249.wav	Once that projected length is available we use the same projected length, but with a 45 degrees because is making one of its sides with its surfaces 45 degrees inclined to horizontal plane	train
audio_0_76318.wav	20 into total actual time is we have to go for looking at the actual time	train
audio_0_210459.wav	So, in today's class, we have covered drawing instruments and lettering of these drawings	train
audio_0_52592.wav	The other part is that the components are very cheap	train
audio_0_82023.wav	Then we looked at the product B and in case of the product we when we calculated the MPV we have found out that this variance is favorable and by a huge amount of 575 rupees	train
audio_0_119990.wav	So, now we are going to form a junction between this metal, which has a work function, which is greater than the work function of the semiconductor	train
audio_0_132000.wav	Sometimes, you know I think that people have the illusion that because we see such rapid advances in things like microelectronics and things like that	train
audio_0_2814.wav	Next similarly, the same same question was there for when 2 capacitors were in series right	train
audio_0_191759.wav	But if it a very high capacity motor the current carried will also be large, so I have to make sure that I square r losses are not too high and I should not have very low efficiency, generally large capacity motors retain to design with a better performance	train
audio_0_148968.wav	Then comes the process oriented theories that try to explain what intelligence says and the lead person here was Jean Piaget	train
audio_0_181327.wav	9 kilo ohm ok	train
audio_0_106945.wav	The point that I am making here is that in both the cases, one thing that we have seen is the silicon dioxide, which is grown on the substrate; the substrate being silicon	train
audio_0_207527.wav	And if we are seeing carefully because this is 70 mm major axis, so the diameter of this entire circle itself is 70 mm	train
audio_0_195821.wav	So if I compare an electric circuit and magnetic circuit, I should say on the one side let me write electric circuit, on the other side, let me write magnetic circuit, so if I say that in this particular case, this is going to be EMF, in this particular case, it is going to be MMF	train
audio_0_32882.wav	And what we have seen in this particular implementation are three things rather, we have seen how to put a comment in our code, we have seen that python allows this kind of simultaneous updation of two variables at the same time so m comma n equal to n comma m	train
audio_0_173800.wav	284 ampere, so the total energy stored in the coupled inductance can be given as w equal to half L 1 I 1 square plus M I 1 I 2 plus half L 2 I 2 square	train
audio_0_186908.wav	when the demand is too high as compared to the capacity various tactics can be used to reduce the demand during peak periods as illustrated in figure uhh and discussed below communicate with customers an approach to shifting demand when it is too high is to let customers know the periods of high demand customers can be requested to visit the facility at periods of low demand modify timing and location of service delivery longer operating hours shh suiting the requirements of customers can be a method of shifting demand moreover locating facilities like banks and theatres to supermarkets or hypermarkets can also help in smoothing demand for these facilities offer incentives for non peak usage incentives can be offered for beginning of season or end of season usage	train
audio_0_56832.wav	we want to do so because you may have noticed by now that e is a vector quantity	train
audio_0_86225.wav	ok, so cantilever, essentially	train
audio_0_68305.wav	see, the idea is simple	train
audio_0_113518.wav	In this case what we see we see that VDS is equals to VGS minus VC	train
audio_0_44755.wav	And, then Faraday finally, had this an equation which related the electric field to the magnetic field, but still it was not these were at that time these equations were not just 4 equation, but they were written in some different format there were plenty of them	train
audio_0_146120.wav	Now, with respect to addition and subtraction in binary these two make no difference	train
audio_0_6408.wav	So, then you can say that it is a linear element; in general a circuit is a linear if it is both homogeneous and additive right	train
audio_0_79299.wav	It is one thing is that is the budgeting process from top to bottom	train
audio_0_118371.wav	One way we can think about it is that if these values are lower than the influence of the lattice is less and so you have higher conductivity	train
audio_0_172947.wav	C is the constant of proportionality which is known as capacitance of that capacitor	train
audio_0_18477.wav	So I think that part is editing, doing the editing part, review part	train
audio_0_48650.wav	Why are we assuming its a LTI we are	train
audio_0_71162.wav	many look like h, may not look like x, but it will be a tree nevertheless	train

audio_0_139839.wav	Welcome to Module 21 of Programming in C++	train
audio_0_146005.wav	First step is you have to go to developer	train
audio_0_150980.wav	So, the error signal equal to frequency deviation delta F or speed deviation delta omega is equal to omega minus omega r is it will be is amplified and integrated to produce a is amplified means this gain is there	train
audio_0_60833.wav	quantity is equal to k, magnitude in y direction	train
audio_0_199838.wav	We won't go into those details	train
audio_0_45474.wav	So now, that we have done this let us try to convert equations 1 2 3 using our central difference idea	train
audio_0_206571.wav	Now, click again	train
audio_0_190188.wav	So sandwiched coils and concentric coils, these are two ways of reducing leakage reactance	train
audio_0_197736.wav	I will have if I assume that it is rotating in anticlockwise direction	train
audio_0_186056.wav	So, the op amp will try to increase it is output further	train
audio_0_17178.wav	So, at this point, so, now you apply the nodal analysis	train
audio_0_1743.wav	So, following assumptions are made for an ideal transformer	train
audio_0_108487.wav	So, you can see you can change the selection, you can bring it or you with this mode button, you can change it, right	train
audio_0_173964.wav	So what would be the value of this element	train
audio_0_11929.wav	So, it will be basically v minus V s upon R plus C dv by dt are is equal to 0	train
audio_0_213282.wav	So, once we are done with p' q' and p q which is also 60, the projected ones	train
audio_0_154733.wav	That if the voltage gradient it becomes at 5 to 10 kilo Volt per centimeter; surrounding earth you will be ionized and at the time what will happen	train
audio_0_64007.wav	ok, constrained pin means such timing constrained must have to be satisfied for the input data	train
audio_0_66823.wav	how do i testing	train
audio_0_124896.wav	At the beginning, I have said that we can do a transformation from lowpass to high pass prototypes	train
audio_0_185780.wav	So, let me draw the scale of the instrument and I have a pointer	train
audio_0_44095.wav	It will be identical accept that there is no incident field term that incident field term came as the integral of the current	train
audio_0_67255.wav	so if the wires are separated widely, say, here the biggest dot shows s equals to infinity	train
audio_0_17645.wav	Yes, I do carry a notebook which is where I write my stuff which is important and relevant to me	train
audio_0_163047.wav	There are two items given here	train
audio_0_39346.wav	This guy right, this guy is unknown	train
audio_0_113801.wav	So with this we will actually wind up this particular lecture, so we had seen in this last two lectures about how heaps are managed and how you could actually use vulnerabilities in the program such as a double free vulnerability to exploit the heap, thank you	train
audio_0_215347.wav	So, if I socially done everybody will try	train
audio_0_149939.wav	You realized that species which have more and more genetic variations they survive	train
audio_0_40517.wav	She says take the real part ok, common mistake; now that is not enough	train
audio_0_148646.wav	I will just repeat this once more	train
audio_0_52714.wav	I mean every country launches its remote sensing satellites to sense the earth right	train
audio_0_125454.wav	Then QL comes out to be equal to this where phi R comes from this equation that we had earlier derived	train
audio_0_85850.wav	So as it is written here that there are basically two reasons why actual results might differ from the master budgets, right	train
audio_0_158777.wav	And every month we get the bill for electricity on the 10th of next month	train
audio_0_125689.wav	If we come back to the slides on the, if we come back to the slides, written slides, the CP is given by this expression and the value of C2 is given as S22 Delta S11 star	train
audio_0_206646.wav	Open the new one, then we click the New one	train
audio_0_215482.wav	So, the example on the left hand side you see that three slider bars are one below the other with brightness contrast and volume together	train
audio_0_73295.wav	but the issue is that if you look in to the available cad tools that there in the market, we will find that there are many such available tools	train
audio_0_47762.wav	So, you get 1 2 3 peaks you get	train
audio_0_83382.wav	So, it is concerned with accounting information that is useful to managers, not everything	train
audio_0_13334.wav	22 plus j 0	train
audio_0_113545.wav	VGS minus V T is one volt because of this one volt excess voltage there will be a formation of the channel this will be the width of the channel	train
audio_0_109322.wav	So, let us see this experiment so, again we can see on the breadboard which is right over here, right	train
audio_0_180154.wav	It is discharging only because this transistor is on and it is on only when this is high	train
audio_0_7250.wav	Therefore natural response v n is already expressed in section 6	train
audio_0_211913.wav	These are arbitrary points	train
audio_0_148585.wav	There are certain points to be noted that in that MQ2 gas sensor there is a heater inside the sensor	train
audio_0_208623.wav	And material is only removed from here, but not from center line	train
audio_0_91957.wav	So this model, build and fix model is a very, very informal model, suitable only for projects where which is rather trivial like a student assignment	train
audio_0_72812.wav	so it is g, b	train
audio_0_208059.wav	So, this way also represents that there is a circle and the diameter is 7	train
audio_0_176880.wav	Now if current through the load R is the output and in one case when you apply Vs equal to 10 volt we get current as 2 Mpi	train
audio_0_57330.wav	so according to the gausses law we can write: and length of this surface is capital l, the radius cylindrical selling is capital, r in the radius of gaussian surface is smaller	train
audio_0_57936.wav	now we will move to question number six	train
audio_0_169373.wav	If we listen to a person and nod as a sign of “Yes, I understand or I am listening, please continue	train
audio_0_165704.wav	We should ideally have O1 as the complexity because if the tasks are more and the scheduling points occur very frequently every few microseconds or so, then the runtime overhead becomes significant	train
audio_0_44615.wav	So, TM polarization, you would take the different conventions for electric field and I will again I will just write down the final expression ok, you will notice a symmetry between these expressions	train
audio_0_193455.wav	Now, whatever is wsc this is the 3 phase power	train
audio_0_211801.wav	So, this is the point and let us name this one as 1	train
audio_0_114837.wav	So, this particular section is known as the Relocatable Table	train
audio_0_87765.wav	So, neurons are if you see this picture	train
audio_0_213290.wav	First what we have to do, draw a XY line; X axis Y axis	train
audio_0_211592.wav	And if these are cylindrical kind of objects center lines are there; then cut plane line always have a precedence, compared to axis or center line	train
audio_0_6121.wav	So, current will be i is equal to v by R is equal to 30 by 5 is equal to 6 ampere	train
audio_0_195159.wav	So in the process we will also be talking about applications, right	train
audio_0_198496.wav	So, when I add them	train
audio_0_208516.wav	If I remove that, we have this material, material is there	train
audio_0_7669.wav	65 ohm and this one Xe 1 x 1 plus K square x 2 will 6 plus 3 square	train
audio_0_100816.wav	What you see here is the instrumentation that is typically required	train
audio_0_48531.wav	So, this incident yeah you are ok	train
audio_0_124578.wav	Now one other property of noise figure if we have a cascade of networks, say 2 networks, this has a noise figure value of F1 and available gain value GA1	train
audio_0_102300.wav	If I were to introduce more and more steel in the cross section, then basically it's after cracking that you will see increased capacity in the wall	train
audio_0_19988.wav	So that makes it the basis on which you can test your ideas, so that is list of assumptions for you	train
audio_0_46570.wav	At each centre there is going to be some value of magnetic field H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 ok	train
audio_0_168724.wav	He has suggested that this time preference is like a room in which some people are allowed to enter while others are kept out of it	train
audio_0_211623.wav	Note the hatch directions where material is present; because section is considered only here, but not inside of that circle, that is a reason circle is complete	train
audio_0_180831.wav	Here I will give the input signal maybe not directly maybe through this flip flop	train
audio_0_162623.wav	I'll just show the last slide again	train
audio_0_191067.wav	I am essentially looking at very very thin rectangular sheets, each of them stuck to another rectangular sheet behind that, all of them will have the same dimension, only thing what I will ensure is between the first sheet and the second sheet, I put an insulator layer	train
audio_0_703.wav	Now, also S is equal to S max 2 in that case if you do so, then S is equal to it will it will become r 2 dash upon x 2 dash	train
audio_0_82101.wav	35 was the opening stock, 795 was the material used from the purchases	train
audio_0_48981.wav	So, we are assuming that as with almost all real life problems the there are no magnetic materials around ok	train
audio_0_39432.wav	Square bracket actually yeah square bracket should not include the	train
audio_0_181607.wav	Since V 2 equal to 0 and this is also equal to 0; so, that means, V N will also be equal to 0, because we know for this circuit, virtual sorting works we have seen that	train
audio_0_110534.wav	So, if I do not want to consider Acm into Vcm in practical situation then I cannot just ignore Acm into Vcm	train
audio_0_33892.wav	So, in essense, all that delete requires us to do is to reassign the pointer from before the deleted node with the pointer after the deleted node	train
audio_0_169658.wav	I am good never mind	train
audio_0_137151.wav	So, this behavior if you look at then this behavior is already very clear to you	train
audio_0_211603.wav	Similarly, we have an extra material and taper kind of thing then naturally we will have this portion	train
audio_0_10044.wav	Similarly, this 1 2 ampere currents source and another 5 ampere in the same it is not valid because it is a simple circuit	train
audio_0_175342.wav	So, we can understand this with the help of this figure in which at one port that is input port we are applying the voltage and at the output port we are adding the Ammeter to find out the value of current	train
audio_0_135125.wav	We have seen at depth an example of a max function which we first wrote in the templatized form used it for int and double and then we specialized it for C strings and then we showed that it will work also for user define types like complex	train
audio_0_170771.wav	Gastronomic tradition is dependent on culture and it is an unavoidable tool for learning about cultural differences	train
audio_0_192741.wav	Sometimes we may have only capacitor run motor	train
audio_0_153199.wav	The load changes by 1	train
audio_0_48399.wav	So, the first equation, it gave me some term A 1 1 U 1 plus A 1 2 U 2, did I have any U 3 and U 4 terms	train
audio_0_12575.wav	That means, that this equation 36 actually this is equation this is your equation this is your equation this is your equation 36	train
audio_0_64943.wav	now, depending on the kind of the functional block, the total time you take to generate the output can be unequal, like the example that i will take	train
audio_0_113172.wav	You have gain on y axis; you have frequency on x axis	train
audio_0_70555.wav	so for interconnections, there are three pins	train
audio_0_60715.wav	and so this, this, this line, this forms one boundary and all over the place, up infinity, ah, let me just make it up to infinity	train
audio_0_194151.wav	So even if you are given a secondary winding in delta you would again like to convert everything into per phase quantity and that is how you will draw the overall equivalent circuit of the transformer and when we are converting delta into per phase	train
audio_0_10456.wav	So, Z p is equal to Z p angle theta, then Z p conjugate will be Z p angle minus theta, this is magnitude right	train
audio_0_112119.wav	So, in the next module, we will see how we can solve the differential amplifier	train
audio_0_114989.wav	So, essentially any data which is to be executed from the enclave is going to be stored in the RAM in an encrypted state	train
audio_0_148015.wav	They will mostly be programmable and for that some knowledge about technology is very important	train
audio_0_136712.wav	Now, certainly you would be curious to know as to why we are creating these two static and dynamic type concepts, and how they will be used, so that will unfold after maybe another module also when we actually show applications of how the dynamic type is really very critical to do object oriented programming	train
audio_0_46688.wav	Now the question is what happens when delta x and delta t are finite ok	train
audio_0_36634.wav	However, it takes an optional argument end equal to string which changes what we put at the end, in particular if we put an empty string it means that it does not start a new line, so the next print will continue on the same line	train
audio_0_140903.wav	Now, we will move on to	train
audio_0_13451.wav	I think you have got it, right	train
audio_0_172236.wav	Tree is one kind of sub graph which is important for our circuit analysis and it is form by removing a branch from the graph	train
audio_0_67398.wav	this is a composite tree which consists of horizontal and vertical slices, as well as this wheel	train
audio_0_1524.wav	So, this implies that if it is so that V a n plus V b n plus V c n is equal to 0	train
audio_0_71664.wav	so let us let me explain this with the help of an example	train
audio_0_196411.wav	Because we do not want to again start the DC motor from 0 speed bring it up to 1500 rpm and so on so forth	train

audio_0_12946.wav	And theta one theta 2 are the angles of V 1 and V 2 respectively, right	train
audio_0_206711.wav	So, when we are looking in that direction horizontal plane rotate it we will see it like it rectangle and this one maps to a circle in that way	train
audio_0_85684.wav	We have calculated from this information	train
audio_0_64613.wav	so the wavefronts are slowly expanding in their sizes and they are coming closer and closer together	train
audio_0_163252.wav	Do you see any moment in the number of shares	train
audio_0_197131.wav	So even if they are of kind of opposite polarity it should not matter so much because they are anyway on the verge of changing this process of changing the current from positive to negative, or negative to positive we call that as commutation which we will discuss in detail at the later class not today	train
audio_0_111118.wav	That is why, I also tell you the examples	train
audio_0_117187.wav	So, these are non computational because it does these do not actually modify the data but rather they just either store the data or just route the data to specific locations or just provide a look up so on	train
audio_0_60102.wav	so it makes sense to define a magnetic dipole, alright, and i can say that magnetic field, which i am going to denote by b, b, r, is going to be some constant which will depend on the units, the net magnetic dipole moment dotted with r, r three minus m, divided by r cubed	train
audio_0_116568.wav	Similarly the red line is connected to 1 in this case and 0 in this particular multiplexer and therefore when the select line is 0, it is a red line that can switch	train
audio_0_164802.wav	That's why it is marked as both I and O	train
audio_0_192998.wav	So from here, I should be able to write this as Henry per meter	train
audio_0_112221.wav	Yes, it is also integrated circuit	train
audio_0_55323.wav	So this thermister is called by various names in the market	train
audio_0_114127.wav	So, Te4 is also present but we will not be using this and the other tables I use for decryption which is not going to be important for us	train
audio_0_111345.wav	The first IC on the left corner	train
audio_0_192927.wav	If I have 10 turns, definitely I am going to have a higher amount of MMF	train
audio_0_54401.wav	We want the output to rectifier	train
audio_0_184296.wav	The these two conditions so, this two values of R X will be very close to each other on this scale will be very close to each other on the scale ok	train
audio_0_32927.wav	This actually seems to be worst then our earlier algorithm in certain cases	train
audio_0_108585.wav	So, again he is connecting this multimeter, right	train
audio_0_5889.wav	So, it is also small it is almost 0 will neglect it, right	train
audio_0_203764.wav	The first expression is useful when VGS is constant	train
audio_0_14589.wav	5 this is the mid length, that is mean height right, 8	train
audio_0_74516.wav	This is June, this is July and this is August	train
audio_0_184010.wav	Do not use it rather use this circuit where you can connect a voltmeter directly across this resistance R X	train
audio_0_8506.wav	So, that is what is written in right	train
audio_0_82763.wav	Now we will do one more problem, right	train
audio_0_63586.wav	so this is placement	train
audio_0_215573.wav	But this can be brought into a teaching and learning context, and several e learning platforms right from open source, LMS is like Moodle have wikis as a built into tool	train
audio_0_194200.wav	So when I am actually looking at a rectifier output I may have A phase, B phase and C phase rectified completely right	train
audio_0_60650.wav	so problem that you just saw the solution of, in which we had a point dipole in an infinite medium and what was exploited was that m induced due to the magnetic field that was produced by the, this dipole is going to be proportional to b itself and therefore their functional dependence on r or space variables was the same	train
audio_0_165632.wav	So, we calculate pat plus those number of shares	train
audio_0_205091.wav	So, to fix this we will select the two edges of crankshaft, and this crank casing and we will to make it coincide and we will select ok in this mini toolbar	train
audio_0_33956.wav	So, this is the delete call	train
audio_0_194996.wav	So, under short circuit test, whatever is the voltage I apply, indirectly it gives me an indication of what are the internal impedances of the winding of the transformer, it gives me a feel for what is R1 plus R2 dash, what is X1 plus X2 dash	train
audio_0_166347.wav	To understand what is priority inversion, let's assume that a task instance that is a job is executing its critical section	train
audio_0_137186.wav	When it is non static, I do not care about this, because if it is non static I know at some point some object will get instantiated like obj 1; and wherever obj 1 gets instantiated, x will be a part of it	train
audio_0_64930.wav	so same thing will happen here also	train
audio_0_174237.wav	So, if you see the particular forward path all three loops which you can see in the signal flow graph are touching the forward path	train
audio_0_155137.wav	You put all these values, that means; magnitude of V 4 that expression of V j your what you call V m 2 is equal to D j j minus A j j to the power half	train
audio_0_59805.wav	If they are at opposite signs, then force is going to be attractive	train
audio_0_72548.wav	the output is floating and the voltage will depend on the charge stored in the load capacitor	train
audio_0_72712.wav	so usually the quality of the partitions that are generated in this process is not so good	train
audio_0_144849.wav	They may invite an expert speaker, they may conduct workshops; they may have some kind of an awareness measure done in the university and all these things are right now being done in universities whether they have an IP centre or not	train
audio_0_135414.wav	So, this is just a matter of convention that exists in C++ sort	train
audio_0_196302.wav	On the other hand, if I try to draw similar thing for the motor right I am going to have basically, again let me draw may be this is what is my V angle 0 I am starting with V angle 0 okay	train
audio_0_127670.wav	Zone 2 was corroding more	train
audio_0_58920.wav	let us now see, explore this equations a better in this lecture and see what they predict	train
audio_0_141276.wav	In this a module we have actually continued from our previous module, the module 18 and we have discussed about several issues of operator overloading a specifically the issue of doing operator overloading when your parameter types could be varied and when particularly in terms of IO when your two parameters are of two different class types and so on	train
audio_0_152400.wav	All 3 transformers have a thermal capability of 120 percent of the nameplate rating capacitor, that is that whenever the gain this kind of thing that 120 percent of the thermal rating thermal capability; that means, you will concentrate this way that I I am sure that you have studied in machine design also for transformer design the meaning is you take it other way this transformer can take overload of 20 percent more than that right	train
audio_0_185332.wav	Firstly, we should never do it because then, I mean if we are inserting a high impedance in series, the transmission line is disturbed it is current I mean even I mean because we know ammeter should not have large impedance; why	train
audio_0_74265.wav	The average gross profit on the sales is 40 percent is another important condition for calculating the cost, especially the cost of material	train
audio_0_112982.wav	Welcome to this module and in this module, we will understand what exactly photoresist is	train
audio_0_45583.wav	Yeah, you want to know now what is electric field let us at the location exactly you want to	train
audio_0_183784.wav	So, if ever I just give some symbols, if V i is increased then of course, V N will also increase because V N is some sort of average of this V i and V o	train
audio_0_191650.wav	But when I am talking about nonideality in any machine I am definitely going to have some inherent resistance for the armature	train
audio_0_74921.wav	So, it means if you calculate this amount, total interest you have to calculate here is for 318,000 for a period of 2 months at the rate of 10% and on the balance of 10,000 for a period of how many months for one month only and the rate of 10%	train
audio_0_184666.wav	Sorry this is not volt this is the ohm then you can	train
audio_0_40528.wav	Right; so these guys, these guys and these guys this is where the medium properties come into place ok	train
audio_0_35567.wav	So, what is happening here is that, square is being assigned to f, 5 is being assigned to x, and 2 is being assigned to n	train
audio_0_107150.wav	So, this is the last module for this particular lecture, we were looking at the opamp and using the opamp as several circuits	train
audio_0_213161.wav	So, P point to K and K to Q; they are equal	train
audio_0_72015.wav	so now people talk about creating something called ah technology library where some of the small standard designs i have already created in a very efficient way	train
audio_0_160632.wav	And this was not just in 2000, this was happening in last four years from 96 to 2000, continuous accounting manipulations were done and thus profits were overstated	train
audio_0_34791.wav	On the other hand, if i is not a common factor we need to proceed by checking the next one which is to go backwards and this is the achieved by this update	train
audio_0_83855.wav	So, we are putting it as a separate figure and then the next cost is the so first we have taken the variable cost then we have taken the fixed cost and this is normal cost sheet and here we have calculated the total cost of production is how much that is 21 lac 55,000	train
audio_0_17690.wav	On notebooks	train
audio_0_177609.wav	So you get the value of V3 as 2	train
audio_0_184797.wav	So, let me let me make some space by erasing one step and ok	train
audio_0_124096.wav	Upwards means that we have to connect an inductor in shunt and that is what we have done	train
audio_0_67636.wav	so in red we are marking r a t, required arrival time	train
audio_0_185863.wav	So, I just have followed the direction where in which direction I want the current to flow and I have put these diodes accordingly	train
audio_0_2577.wav	So, so V ab V ab will be cancelled therefore, I CA will be equal to I AB angle minus 24 240 degree; that means, also IBC similarly you will get I AB angle minus 120 degree	train
audio_0_194737.wav	So let me try to draw this particular winding lap winding for DC machine	train
audio_0_178288.wav	The voltage across terminals a b divided by the current supplied by current source	train
audio_0_157173.wav	Plus the schema no how the representation of the world that you have made in your mind, the mental representation, that might be important in terms of better recollection, accurate recollection or distortion and how motivated you are to recollect the information that would also play an important role	train
audio_0_49329.wav	Global edge number 1, what all variables would have come	train
audio_0_211902.wav	Once that is done divide CF into 5 equal parts	train
audio_0_168355.wav	For example, the way we arrange curtains, screens, the partitions which we create with the help of furniture etcetera and at the same time the way we use colors	train
audio_0_196405.wav	No wonder we have become a very important commodity, power electronic engineer, who make inverters, who basically generate variable frequency	train
audio_0_47953.wav	So, we are almost there; so, let me put a few subscripts here this K over here, this is a on a right; that means, the source and the testing point were A and A	train
audio_0_20848.wav	Or so I think we can put that as the two alternate activities	train
audio_0_184722.wav	So, R A ammeter resistance should be very low compared to R X and then this method is not perfect though, but it is this method is acceptable because then the voltage drop across the this ammeter will be much lower compared to the voltage drop across R X	train
audio_0_39.wav	And Z total number of armature conductors right	train
audio_0_6359.wav	Because you know this one if you go to equation 31, you go to equation 31, that is your this equation, right	train
audio_0_5936.wav	1 v	train
audio_0_212287.wav	Now, from center O to P join a line and draw a perpendicular line to OP in such a way that we are going to measure this distance 19 mm	train
audio_0_44124.wav	So, finally, after having done all of this theory the payoff is how do I actually implemented in my method	train
audio_0_86305.wav	those neurotransmitter secretion will lead to muscle contraction, further lead to muscle force generation	train
audio_0_8805.wav	Also find the circuit current, the voltage across the capacitor and the bandwidth of the circuit right	train
audio_0_193640.wav	It will not be counted into the power loss; we are talking mainly about the real power losses	train
audio_0_124670.wav	I urge you to go through it once	train
audio_0_193799.wav	So, if I tried to plot magnetization characteristics, I am trying to say that they are mainly operating in the linear region of operation	train
audio_0_129738.wav	And this slide here just summarizes the most popular preparation techniques of fresh slice, sorry fresh mix where you can look at the hydration in situ of a slice or a powder	train
audio_0_38050.wav	If you say you are useless, girl maybe or you are ugly looking or you are fat or you are this and that we use such words at home our home, home situation is pretty bad	train
audio_0_33205.wav	So, clearly this cost will vary for different case, and there are many number of cases	train
audio_0_84930.wav	So, then we have to make the payments	train
audio_0_17572.wav	They mostly type in the laptops and things are good for them	train
audio_0_216417.wav	So, we go in and out of evaluate phase after each of the previous phases	train
audio_0_58673.wav	i cancel this	train
audio_0_108770.wav	So, when a wWhatever he is trying to implement, look carefully right look carefully and try to do it at home	train
audio_0_126604.wav	So here suppose you assume your resonator, this resonator to be a simple series R L C network	train
audio_0_140879.wav	So, we ensure that by creating a type or aliasing a type DrawFunc here by type def; which says that it takes a structure GeoObject and returns a void	train
audio_0_109187.wav	And that is how you can calculate the output voltage, how it will change with respect to input below the cut off frequency	train
audio_0_70370.wav	so there are some simple, set theoretic rules i will be illustrating, using which you can compute the fault lists	train
audio_0_104861.wav	This is one more example, before which we will go to the actual experiment, is band pass filter if calculate higher and lower cut off frequencies of active band pass filter, right	train
audio_0_13575.wav	So, v 0 is equal to your ah 2 into 20 40 volt, now v 1 is equal to 2	train
audio_0_74081.wav	But if the budgeted performance was more than the actual performance is a negative variance and in terms of the cost it is reversed so budgeted cost was less and the actual cost is more in that case there is a negative variance we will have to find out the reasons for that and in case of the cost itself if the actual cost is or the budgeted cost was more and the actual cost is less it is a it negative, it's a positive variance	train
audio_0_45668.wav	So, let me start by saying that here this line over here we when we say that say that E is evaluated at integer time girds is a choice, I could have said E is evaluated at half integer time instance ok	train
audio_0_7956.wav	So, this is interesting just go go let us go back to the circuit, right	train
audio_0_108465.wav	So, here if you want to use this multimeter, like I have shown you in the last module, we can we can keep it in the resistance mode	train
audio_0_199458.wav	Here we need to find I0 minus ID	train
audio_0_52133.wav	Yeah electric field derivative at n minus half captures everything right	train
audio_0_210729.wav	Similarly, whatever these horizontal distance on this point, for example, let us pick this one, the same point we will be having on this side	train
audio_0_61176.wav	now the simplest example is if i take a magnet and bring a pin close to it, it gets attracted	train
audio_0_57809.wav	so if i apply dell dot j is equal to minus d row d t	train
audio_0_40746.wav	Now we will get into why we are using two of them it is a very beautiful geometric property only	train
audio_0_137671.wav	So, on E7, the control will go to the destructor	train
audio_0_77750.wav	At the end of the month of the month in question, money is never borrowed at the beginning and repaid at the end of the same month	train
audio_0_20537.wav	I think the major points again is I will reiterate is the first part which is the demography of the customer, the age, the geography and for fun you can even give a the person a name and that sort of rounds up the personality	train
audio_0_36636.wav	Now, sometimes you want to be a little bit more precise, so for this we can use the format method which is actually part of the string library	train
audio_0_169825.wav	Similarly, we find that there are some other interesting positions which our mouth is capable of taking	train
audio_0_139869.wav	So, this is to be read; rose is a flower that is the direction of the arrow, red rose is a rose and so on	train
audio_0_71270.wav	so in this case i have showed two possible matchings	train
audio_0_104352.wav	So if I were, if I know the geometry and the material strengths, can I for the geometry estimate what the strength in compression of the masonry wall is	train
audio_0_100710.wav	So, these two lines are straight lines that go from the origin and define into which region you would fall	train
audio_0_79197.wav	So, comfort means that for example if the income level of the people goes up, then it can be expected that more CTVs may be demanded by the people or maybe there are the different variants of the CTVs	train
audio_0_190624.wav	Which is OPR	train
audio_0_152469.wav	So, that means if x 1 is negative the lowest point O of the imaginary curve dashed line outside the actual span as shown in figure c	train
audio_0_104388.wav	And a fundamental assumption here which can become a point that you take forward and improve with a nonlinear stress strain relationship in compression	train
audio_0_71024.wav	so what i mean to say is that the design, at this same level of abstraction, can be viewed from three different angles: one as the behavior, other as a net list and the other as some components which are actually manufactured and the system is, ah miss, implemented by inter connecting them like chips, in this case	train
audio_0_2022.wav	In this case the rotor now carries three phase currents creating the mmf F2 rotating in the same direction and with the same speed as the stator field	train
audio_0_115219.wav	Furthermore, most of the functions in the library are unused	train
audio_0_55413.wav	So as this is getting charged up this is trying to turn this on this goes through the linear region tries to limit the current through this and then after after it reaches stable state this would be at 15 volts and this would be fully on	train
audio_0_42836.wav	Summation over each time instant right; so, I have this is my time instant say this is my time 0 to t I am going to chop it up into intervals of delta t and then do a summation that is what will happen ok	train
audio_0_145299.wav	Thirdly, there could be some key references that are missed out in certain databases or which do not throw up in certain databases, and and it could be a reason for missing out something which was already there	train
audio_0_199863.wav	Now, with one port elements, we have seen that we could write the equations, then expand the non linearities in a Taylor series around the operating point, neglect higher order terms and so on	train
audio_0_35409.wav	These are the 2 sub problems for paths(5, 10), namely (4, 10) and (5, 9) but, in turn in order to compute (4, 10) I will have to compute whatever is to its left and below it and in order to compute (5, 9) I will also have to compute what is to its left and below it and now what we find is that this quantity namely (4, 9) is computed twice, once because of the left neighbor of (5, 10) and once because of the neighbor below (5, 10)	train
audio_0_49192.wav	So, E minus E i that I can think of as phi right, but what about the second term the term that companies k naught squared is it in that form yet its not right	train
audio_0_11849.wav	So, i is flowing through this is i so, 10 into i right plus we are move we are moving like this; we are moving like this we are moving like this plus your this i 2 current is flowing through 60 and 30; So, 90 i2 90 i2 right, then minus 4 is equal to 0 because this 5 volt so, right but i were, but question is that 10 i is equal to i 1 plus i 2 plus 90 i 2 is equal to 5 right, but i 2 is equal to i 1	train
audio_0_108394.wav	0 is already, there is no need to change it, no worries,	train
audio_0_57053.wav	so e inside would be zero and e at the surface would always be perpendicular and far away	train
audio_0_43881.wav	In terms of x and u, I can write this as and x like this x 1, x n multiplied by u 1, u n right	train
audio_0_1870.wav	So, it is I0 sin ∅ and this I c will be I0 cos ∅0 right	train
audio_0_127863.wav	What are the reasons and who is going to look at this numbers	train
audio_0_159707.wav	Company pays cash, so bank balance come on jay	train
audio_0_129681.wav	Now why do we need to stop hydration	train
audio_0_31889.wav	In general range i, j, like a slice i to j, starts at i and goes up to j minus 1	train
audio_0_34982.wav	A final use of heap is to actually sort, we are taking out one element at a time starting with maximum one	train
audio_0_192523.wav	This is what you would have seen many times in railway compartment and all	train
audio_0_127770.wav	We are not trying to stop corrosion	train
audio_0_20312.wav	So, he used what you will see is a very important case study, a very famous case study in that point of time called Arcturus IV	train
audio_0_152971.wav	For example, suppose if V is equal to that mod V is equal to 1	train
audio_0_100648.wav	The wall must deflect by GL by 4T that we saw earlier to be able to close the gap	train
audio_0_116017.wav	So, as we know what happens over here is the address of the next instruction that is this instruction gets moved into the EAX register	train
audio_0_41380.wav	So, there is no value of c that I can play around with that can make this expression going to 0	train
audio_0_112677.wav	In general, now we have an idea of how oscillators would work right	train
audio_0_744.wav	So, in your what you called generally the power it is AC, but we use some kind of mechanism such that it will your what you call it will be converted to DC right	train
audio_0_38665.wav	So, this I O ports are very important parts in them and all micro controllers, they will have some I O port integrated into them	train
audio_0_38845.wav	And the values of all the CPU registers will be lost, so that they some of the values will be reset	dev
audio_0_95052.wav	So 10,000 by 1 lakh into 100 coming to be 10%	dev
audio_0_193168.wav	Why should you have some kind of braking method	dev
audio_0_106072.wav	So, R 2 by R 1 will be equal to 1, right or R or R 2 will be equal to R	dev
audio_0_216252.wav	Let me show two examples	dev

audio_0_16761.wav	Yhis is rms value, that is V m by root 2 and this one also this angle is minus 90 degree	dev
audio_0_210917.wav	So, the dimensions always we mentioned like 40 units and arc 10 units	dev
audio_0_144549.wav	So, you would normally discuss with the searcher as to what are the things that the searcher should look for, and what is the time and resources that you will be putting into the search	dev
audio_0_178137.wav	Now, let us take few of the examples so that you can understand the concept	dev
audio_0_33319.wav	Now implicitly, if you just give a file name it will look for it in the current folder or directory where you running the script	dev
audio_0_168651.wav	Since these early works, we find that a number of works and commentaries have come out on the significance of chronemics in the field of professional communication	dev
audio_0_137538.wav	Now, here we also show another short cut or convenient way to express the standard library symbols, note after the hash includes in the C++ program, we have written a line saying using name space std	dev
audio_0_33427.wav	If we want to get with a new line character, remember this is only a string and the new line character is going to be a last character in this string	dev
audio_0_64699.wav	so whatever we are talking about there, we were mainly talking about how much was the total manhattan distance between the two points, steiner tree cost and so on and so forth	dev
audio_0_76787.wav	So now, what we have to find out here is that is the net cash, receipt oblique disversed	dev
audio_0_177205.wav	But in industrial establishment, you will directly see that 3 phase power supply is given to run the big loads and all these operating either at 50 degree or 50 hertz or 60 hertz	dev
audio_0_34129.wav	So, in the same way, a slice stops one position short of the last index in the slice	dev
audio_0_137050.wav	So, if I interchange x and y it is same as interchanging a, and b	dev
audio_0_179972.wav	So, we will again put the Independent Sources back to the circuit, and then we will find the voltage that is open circuit voltage across the terminal of network A	dev
audio_0_159806.wav	Now if the payment is made by means of cash and cash equivalent that should be separately shown	dev
audio_0_78275.wav	Because element of the fixed cost is there in the absorption costing	dev
audio_0_16433.wav	Now now question is that voltage plot this is my your in between your what you call ah v is equal to 2 t just just one minute let me move little bit up right	dev
audio_0_64968.wav	first, lets say this was my original circuit	dev
audio_0_1667.wav	So, now, that V a n see here what we call and V b c angle between V b c and V a n, it is 90 degree right and all angles are marked right	dev
audio_0_108017.wav	We will see output which is opposite phase, this is 180 degree phase shift, alright	dev
audio_0_211363.wav	If the second picture comes, naturally it becomes a 2, b 2 and so on that that is the standard convention we follow it	dev

audio_0_163956.wav	So, 90,000 upon 4 is a depreciation per annum	dev
audio_0_131413.wav	Now because you have got this large interaction volume of a few microns, so you can see you have got this beam damage, this spot looks very small but in fact underneath the sample, if you remember that diagram at the beginning we are actually analysing an area that is sort of this kind of size, which will usually contain C S H intermixed mix with other phases and we can look at that intermixing if we make these kind of plots over here	dev
audio_0_197848.wav	So, if I had to bring the field connections out, if it is residing in the rotor I have to bring the field connections out and the field connections when I bring out again, it will come through slip ring and brush, if I am talking about it sitting in the rotor	dev

audio_0_18488.wav	If you can write that down, sum it up from what that, so that way it is easier for you to look or build	dev
audio_0_10005.wav	So, now I am going back to that problem, let me clean this	dev
audio_0_199088.wav	First of all, the gate voltage is 0, because this is connected to 0	dev
audio_0_150857.wav	So, generation actually power system actually chases the load right sometimes, we call it is a load following generator chasing the load or following the load	dev
audio_0_36425.wav	Similarly, for each j from 1 to n we check, whether j divides n and if so we add it to the list fn	dev
audio_0_130185.wav	But sometime as researchers we find that you should focus only on work and it is not good to do other thing but I suppose you do not believe you think that one will also help because you	dev
audio_0_79424.wav	How you are costing your product because if you increase the price in today's competitive market then people will become your former customers	dev
audio_0_200920.wav	, which are the load conductants and source conductants, they are positive	dev
audio_0_18400.wav	But in this again since we are talking about problems, in this I am not seeing how these pictures of my notes will actually act, I mean as another is it that your original problem that if I add too many versions of the notes, it is actually leading to Oh God, my time of preparation that I have to look through all these notes before I can figure out what is going on in the class	dev
audio_0_185636.wav	So, if you recall we had this mechanism there	dev
audio_0_130704.wav	Professor: Well, you have been acclaimed as an excellent teacher, educator and mentor	dev
audio_0_66745.wav	the timing is very critical	dev
audio_0_124547.wav	And related term that is often associated with 2 port networks is what is known as a noise figure	dev
audio_0_113325.wav	That is what is written, the roll off rate increases	dev
audio_0_4120.wav	So, from there you can determine right	dev
audio_0_137797.wav	In the static area is a global static object	dev
audio_0_108501.wav	He is using the same multimeter, and when he is connecting with the probe, we can see the value of the capacitor which is around 464	dev
audio_0_174923.wav	And then we write the value of I in terms of Vth and the Zth and ZL	dev
audio_0_73208.wav	this is not a binary tree, this is four ary tree, which means every vertex has up to four children	dev
audio_0_202327.wav	The formula is still exactly the same, the formula for that VX and it is given by this expression	dev
audio_0_101552.wav	But now considering the section analysis that we had examined in the last few slides	dev
audio_0_46575.wav	So, now, what happens to the right hand side	dev
audio_0_192583.wav	Similarly, PGB which is actually the reverse rotating or backward rotating magnetic field input power that will be I1 square multiplied by RB	dev
audio_0_15819.wav	So, this voltage is your V 1 2 right	dev
audio_0_71312.wav	you go through it	dev
audio_0_180098.wav	So, call this V comp 1 ok; then V comp 1 will be high and flip flop will be set and Q will be high and then what will happen So, now Q I mean the output V B 1 because this is the same thing	dev
audio_0_63698.wav	lets say there are m segments, one, two up to m	dev
audio_0_185991.wav	So, now, to find or solve for these two unknowns, we need two relationships	dev
audio_0_85982.wav	For example 6 lakhs and for this sales the total cost is going to be I will write here say for example 4 lakhs total cost I am saying but in this total cost your 3 lakhs is the variable cost and 1 lakh is the fixed cost	dev
audio_0_125972.wav	So, for a circulator, suppose since I said all the ports are matched, I might be able to write the S parameter matrix like this	dev
audio_0_147270.wav	I will just compile it and then I have already told you, how you will dump the code	dev
audio_0_152615.wav	So, this is that a point A and point B and from the water level midpoint height is 45 meter and from here to here is 30 meter and from here to here is 70 meter	dev
audio_0_68046.wav	so here our timing analyzer told us that the delay should be two	dev
audio_0_37672.wav	And, then the schools have this compulsion of which they will claim that they are playgroups and no we do not teach and we are very creative	dev
audio_0_80504.wav	Next is the repair and maintenance	dev
audio_0_141630.wav	Earlier it was by keypad, now it is by the touch screen	dev
audio_0_212499.wav	So, this length from XY axis to be that line we will project it from X 1 axis here to b 1	dev
audio_0_20903.wav	Personal activity, so yeah straight forward	dev
audio_0_216672.wav	let me align it back	dev
audio_0_75476.wav	During April 2002, sorry during December 2002 the company produced 1,700 kg of the finished output	dev
audio_0_134294.wav	So, the original values being 3 and 5, I am expecting an output 5 naturally, because of the original values	dev
audio_0_14952.wav	Therefore I 1 is equal to I 0, I 0 plus I 2 dash you see the circuit	dev
audio_0_106794.wav	So, what I will do is let us finish this particular module at this particular slide which we understood now that what is op amp right, what are the golden rules of the op amp, and what are the characteristics of open, and what are the power supply whether it is unbalanced or balanced power supply right	dev
audio_0_41454.wav	So, this equation and this equation both of these equations, that form of the operator is the same right	dev
audio_0_7624.wav	99 is equal to then 50 into 10 to the power 3 divided by 50 into 10 to the power 3 plus W i and your copper loss will be half square, because we know that your copper loss is equal to your x square W c and x is a half load, so x is equal to half, so half square W c right	dev
audio_0_102435.wav	Tau is equal to cohesion plus mu into sigma	dev
audio_0_109872.wav	That is possible to a to measure and quantify	dev
audio_0_105408.wav	Now you see this signal	dev
audio_0_51610.wav	Constant right so, U of x endpoint is equal to yeah its x naught is equal to constant right what is the other boundary condition	dev
audio_0_190664.wav	So now we will look at the linear system, where we are going to look at all the quantities in terms of linearized magnetization characteristics where we are going to assume N phi is equal to Li or lambda equal to Li	dev
audio_0_757.wav	Suppose buy some mechanism you have connected right	dev
audio_0_106937.wav	This is first device is numbered 1	dev
audio_0_12197.wav	So, ultimately it will become v is equal to your R into i right that means this i this i is equal to actually v upon R right	dev
audio_0_164590.wav	So, they are your operating activity related outflows	dev
audio_0_175040.wav	So what we can say that the circuit will be stable when k is less than 2R otherwise for K greater than 2R the circuit would be unstable	dev
audio_0_32552.wav	So, the inverse operation of split would be to join strings	dev
audio_0_31897.wav	So, we define a function called factors of n which is going to give back a list of all the factors	dev
audio_0_53743.wav	In such a case with one control input which is the duty cycle you can control only one output	dev
audio_0_166764.wav	Only the low priority tasks can cause inversion to a higher priority task	dev
audio_0_80482.wav	So, the title for this will be flexible budget and variance analysis, flexible budget and variance, what is required to be done here	dev
audio_0_141782.wav	So, in research and we know that research is much different from teaching	dev
audio_0_161703.wav	We will not go into too much of details of it	dev
audio_0_210794.wav	So, that a will be located	dev
audio_0_83378.wav	That is possible but further beyond that further analysis analysing and processing and then analysis of that product or maybe the further any kind of analysis is not possible under cost accounting that only largely gives you the costing information and pricing is available from the market	dev
audio_0_53911.wav	Now after that for the display of the results I have been telling you to label the nodes like this	dev
audio_0_57909.wav	so if you look back the notes in ah, lecture number twenty five, you will find that a for such system, that is a vector potential, is given as mu naught capital	dev
audio_0_203168.wav	And you can immediately see that this can be solved very easily numerically but hand calculation of this is very very painful	dev
audio_0_108243.wav	Here in the last module what we have seen	dev
audio_0_135415.wav	This is just another version of the sort	dev
audio_0_136844.wav	Now in q in B, f is a non virtual, so if I do q pointer f, it will call the f functions in B, because it is statically resolved	dev
audio_0_110411.wav	If you can see, is there any physical connection like this	dev
audio_0_113618.wav	So, while obtaining transfer account only saturation regions are saturation levels are employed, because I D equals to k times VGS minus V T volts square	dev
audio_0_67157.wav	so as we go up, move up, the wires tend to become thicker because there will be more irregularity in the surfaces and laying out those thin wires on the higher layers will be not that reliable	dev
audio_0_120305.wav	Let me then rewrite this expression again	dev
audio_0_4974.wav	So, it is v is equal to 12 volt it is 12 volt right and i is equal to 2 into e to the power minus t ampere therefore, it is 12 into 2 e to the power minus t 24 e to the power minus t watt these a time function, later we will see in ac circuit time function we will see, but just to give you a flavor	dev
audio_0_105898.wav	Same way sine wave, I can get cosine wave with indicator as well	dev
audio_0_65748.wav	ok, with this clusters	dev
audio_0_7311.wav	We will assume that which may come from a source other than V s	dev
audio_0_32876.wav	So, we start with some value and m minus n keeps decreasing	dev
audio_0_146638.wav	Although it is very small in size, there is a very small electric heater that heats up the material inside	dev
audio_0_40116.wav	All we manage to do is get rid of this k squared phi term ok, we still need to do a little bit more vector calculus	dev
audio_0_5400.wav	Therefore, 1 upon 1 by 4, so 4 ohm R Thevenin is equal to 4 ohm	dev
audio_0_34864.wav	The other property with the heap, the first property is structural, it just tells us how the values look in the heap	dev
audio_0_30550.wav	7S effective throat thickness Now gamma mw is a partial safety factor this may be 1	dev
audio_0_33912.wav	So, instead we take the value in the second node which was v 2, copy it here and then pretend we deleted v 2 by making the first node point to the third	dev
audio_0_38207.wav	But also as they became rules, they probably they gave rise to lot of guilt and shame and all	dev
audio_0_205699.wav	And in front of vertical plane this is the vertical plane, in front or back side the way how we look at it	dev
audio_0_44268.wav	So, again you are the way to beat it is only one small delta t delta x ok	dev
audio_0_23216.wav	3 kilonewton right So I can find out the length required at the lower side Lw1 that is that I can make the formula as like this P1 by weld strength weld strength will be tefu by root 3 gamma mw so I can put the value 130	dev
audio_0_31814.wav	Here, we will repeat the stirring action a number of times, but we will not know in advance whether we have to stir it twice or five times, we will stir until the sugar dissolves	dev
audio_0_114931.wav	So now EAX register has the correct address of myglob, the global address	dev
audio_0_129353.wav	Again because control of permeability is paramount, with pozzolanic materials you control the permeability, you do not allow moisture to get in easily and again coming back to the original system ettringite formation in a pozzolanic system may not be as expansive as it is in a cementitious system because of the pH differences in the system	dev
audio_0_41862.wav	You will get even faster convergence for example, in the pulse basis delta testing you have to go nearly 120 N in order to get the resistive part to match to converge, here within half the number of elements within 60 you are able to get convergent result may be even less than that right	dev
audio_0_143153.wav	The licensing of LMB’s work led to the development of Humira	dev
audio_0_4255.wav	So, , lagging power factor it is lagging means current is lagging	dev
audio_0_110437.wav	Concepts are really easy	dev
audio_0_179088.wav	And these two theorem also serve as a useful check on Laplace transform	dev
audio_0_168632.wav	From the modern perspectives, we find that the idea was first of all developed by E Robert Kely who is better known as E R Clay and the same idea was carried forward by William James whom we students of English literature recognized primarily for his use of the phrase is ‘stream of consciousness technique’ in his works	dev
audio_0_183475.wav	So, I write it so, this comes from this static characteristic ok	dev
audio_0_172710.wav	So, the y is adding 2s square y with minus 2 as coefficient so we have minus 2 as a coefficient dy by dt you multiply with minus 3 2s square y	dev
audio_0_162344.wav	And then we went for calculation of ratios	dev
audio_0_37351.wav	We treat them in anti depression, we treat them in cognitive behavior therapy, we treat them, but they should not be taken as something some sky has fallen, because people also have to be taught, especially sitting in a country like India where the sources are limited in the population is must that these type of struggles will happen	dev
audio_0_15245.wav	So, small power transformer have many applications	dev
audio_0_200918.wav	We want to maximize the voltage gain regardless of the value of R S	dev
audio_0_197601.wav	Can any one of you tell me	dev
audio_0_185935.wav	So, this is this will come out approximately, do the calculation with a calculator I do not have a calculator	dev
audio_0_60510.wav	right, for each x, y has definitely changed at each point and we are taking the x value to be out here	dev
audio_0_33843.wav	We said that if we pass a mutable value to a function so long as we do not reassign that thing any mutation inside the function will be reflected outside the function, but if we reassign to the list or dictionary inside the function we get a new copy and then after that any change we make is off	dev
audio_0_124703.wav	That is the intuition off course but is it true in reality	dev
audio_0_17903.wav	First one would be teachers who is actually preparing her notes to teach in the class has a master copy of that notes in a soft copy, which she can be sharing it to her students later, that would be assumption one	dev
audio_0_158798.wav	In our next session we will go ahead and go into further some more types of liabilities and then into profit and loss account	dev
audio_0_114868.wav	However, with Load time relocatable, since each program need a very customized version of the library, that for such kind of sharing will not be possible	dev
audio_0_210740.wav	We are in module number 3, lecture number 30	dev
audio_0_8460.wav	So, that is why if the if the current leaves both the dot or enters both the dot plus sign, if the current either of this coil once it is entering the dot another is leaving the dot it will be minus sign right	dev
audio_0_204400.wav	Now, the reason I am emphasizing this is that sometimes there is a confusion between incremental equivalent circuits and AC equivalent circuits	dev
audio_0_109159.wav	Now if we concentrate on the oscilloscope what we see is, we have applied, 5 V peak to peak	dev
audio_0_210721.wav	Now, from one we have to draw perpendiculars which are going to intersect first line	dev
audio_0_116977.wav	Therefore, what we would achieve is that these two instructions are executed	dev
audio_0_215900.wav	A good example of this is the reflection spot that we use in this very course	dev
audio_0_215875.wav	Choose the best answer among the choices given and then resume the learning dialogue	dev
audio_0_111992.wav	Potentiometer is usually 10 turn device	dev
audio_0_121232.wav	So, If I define alpha as a loss due to absorption and g as the gain due to emission, g must be greater than alpha your gain must be more than your loss and then we define the net gain at a particular position z the net gain depends upon the reflectivity of the 2 layers times exponential g minus alpha over z	dev
audio_0_183679.wav	So, if you see how the resultant flux looks like as time progresses, you see actually the resultant flux is rotating	dev
audio_0_5746.wav	So, what you can do is so this by making this B is equal to H is equal to 0	dev
audio_0_169917.wav	We were had turned down and away while looking up with the smile or tight lipped smile, the person smiling looks play full and secretary	dev
audio_0_58299.wav	so i can immediately write there: either a z is equal to mu, not k, y over two, and a y is equal to zero, or any other combination that gives me thois answer	dev
audio_0_141504.wav	At present this is our final design, we might one to see if we want more refinements of that I would really like if you all you try to work this out and if you think that this design could be improved in some ways	dev
audio_0_148689.wav	But then most of the books of introduction psychology, if you look at it will talk about know these two type approaches, the early approaches	dev
audio_0_55307.wav	So the moment you connect this, the impedance in this path is very minimal, limited only by the parasitics, the track inductance and the ESR of the capacitors and such, such of the non idealities	dev
audio_0_110844.wav	So, I have R f I have R i, I can put a value of R i substitute the value of R i, I have found C 1, I have found C 2, I have found R 1 I have found R, R I; I know R f I know R i 2, I know R 3 I know R f	dev
audio_0_212900.wav	It includes many parts like rollers, bearings, main structure, there is something like a shade and many things	dev
audio_0_17642.wav	So important, you are saying this environment would probably be in the class, in the classroom, right	dev
audio_0_153501.wav	So, this is actually; that means, this is actually id minus j I q right; ah plus your j I c this way we can write	dev
audio_0_35429.wav	Now we can go up and see that this thing is also known because, it also depends only on the value below it and once that is known then these 2 are known	dev
audio_0_41581.wav	What is given to you by Nyquist rate ok	dev
audio_0_170442.wav	But these should always be plant sometimes a good speaker can also train oneself to use them effectively	dev
audio_0_4163.wav	Therefore the total power absorbed is P T is equal to P 1 plus P 2 plus P 3	dev
audio_0_163284.wav	Now we have been given gross profit which is almost like an operating profit	dev
audio_0_48776.wav	In order for us to solve this equation if I just go back to the original equation over here and I say give me a solution to this right	dev
audio_0_85661.wav	4 per kg this is the price that is rupees 2	dev
audio_0_127884.wav	So, this tell us the different aspects of a lifecycle, a material is born and then it is used and after sometime in any structure or any application we might have to renew it we might have to transfer it or we have to see how we can reuse it	dev
audio_0_63415.wav	as data one goes from stage one to stage two, data two will come into stage one	dev
audio_0_216369.wav	We need to also consider learners interest and attitude towards the topic and towards e learning, these are slightly separate things and these do affect the final outcomes as well as the learning experience	dev
audio_0_102682.wav	However, the other code that has been in existence and regulates the design of unreinforced masonry for structural purposes is 1905	dev
audio_0_138545.wav	So, there is the list is much, much longer	dev
audio_0_83194.wav	It means we can borrow for the negative balance if we have to pay more than the collections then the amount can be generated by the way of the borrowing from the bank which is a normal practice with all the businesses that you can borrow for your short term payments in the form of working capital loans which are borrowed on the basis of months, weeks and sometimes on the daily basis	dev
audio_0_36705.wav	Likewise, for a queue the only way we can modify a queue is to add something to the tail of the queue using the function add q and remove the element at the head of the queue using the function remove q	dev
audio_0_119443.wav	In the case of 1 node you have 2 times lambda by 2 equal to 3 a	dev
audio_0_178524.wav	So, now let us see another example where you need to find out the Norton's equivalent for the circuit given in the figure	dev
audio_0_209705.wav	So, we will be in a position to see that as a projection 30 degrees a’ b’	dev
audio_0_55359.wav	At that time energize this relay so the switch will be closed and now the resistance is bypassed, current will go through that relay and normal operation begins	dev
audio_0_190197.wav	The number of lines and escaping into air gap decreases, the leakage decreases, right	dev
audio_0_141660.wav	Now, we can see that this was over written and this is again being over written because the way you call through a touchscreen is quite different this is also	dev
audio_0_131269.wav	So that is one of the advantages with a non contact type extensometer, the other advantage is that this material can crack anywhere in the specimen	dev
audio_0_130734.wav	And here I think we need to be developing the performance approaches	dev
audio_0_166426.wav	We will start with the simplest scheduler	dev
audio_0_118181.wav	Now if c has a value greater than 0 that is if c is a positive number then the value of c becomes 0 and the function would terminate	dev
audio_0_201697.wav	There, typically passive components like resistors and capacitors are very inexpensive, whereas transistors are a lot more expensive	dev
audio_0_45001.wav	Homogeneous differential equation means the right hand side is	dev
audio_0_7649.wav	High voltage side is primary say low voltage side will define as secondary, here it is look at the curser right	dev
audio_0_4225.wav	9 lagging and also the value of C P right	dev
audio_0_173717.wav	So, this is what the value of A you get	dev
audio_0_168254.wav	French people can feel that Germans insult their intelligence by explaining the obvious	dev
audio_0_43411.wav	So, the way these are constructed is very clever again the place where this there is 1, the other basis function has a value 0	dev
audio_0_59893.wav	As I said is now that given any field E at r, the force on a charge q, put there is going to be q times this E r	dev
audio_0_46793.wav	So, what are these Z 1 1 and Z 2 2, these will be called the self impedance right	dev
audio_0_59631.wav	notice that in this problem, when the charge is moving at the origin, although the field pointing down, and yet we have displacement current which is pointing the current in the positive z direction, somehow, at the first glance its look counterintuitive, but not anymore when you realize that with the time the field is actually decreasing in magnitude as the rate of change of the electric field that is related to the displacement current	dev
audio_0_7615.wav	8 power factor and x is 1, so it is not shown in here, but multiplied by 1 right, they are divided by the same value plus iron loss plus your copper loss W i plus W c	dev
audio_0_62569.wav	by the time i finish establishing, this current is one half a volume, integral j r, dot a r	dev
audio_0_91498.wav	So let's see in the project risk what is happening	dev
audio_0_90415.wav	Welcome back into the lecture series on Cell Culture Technology	dev
audio_0_126887.wav	This condition that is satisfied is called the maximally flat condition	dev
audio_0_150333.wav	Now, it says that if you are looking at type preferences and the 16 personality types it comes out of it	dev
audio_0_4778.wav	And if you look into that, then this is mesh and this is 1 mesh and in between 2 mesh 1 current source is there right	dev
audio_0_43094.wav	I have just drawn a rectangle it can be any shape you want, depending on the problem fine	dev
audio_0_213101.wav	And also if an exterior point is there, connecting that exterior point as a tangent to that circle, how to do that	dev
audio_0_142636.wav	So, regardless of what a person or a team develops in the university, it is important that the invention is not disclosed until it is protected by filing a patent application	dev
audio_0_210890.wav	In that, in the last classes, we have seen if I want to draw a line, I can draw it in that way	dev
audio_0_177073.wav	Now, let us talk about the inductors, suppose the inductors, there are Ln inductors which are connected in series	dev
audio_0_113864.wav	So, for example when no keys are pressed the execution time which is measured by the spy process is low and when a particular key is pressed then we see an increase in the execution time as you see in these instances	dev
audio_0_112420.wav	We have already seen the summation amplifier, where we can add the voltages and then we can amplify according to our amplification factor to get the final output	dev
audio_0_198366.wav	And electrically created because of the stator induced EMF eventually, which will cost induced current that is also a three phase current that we definitely create a revolving magnetic field	dev
audio_0_129549.wav	So blended binders are much better for sustainability is what comes out clearly in the life cycle assessment	dev
audio_0_66779.wav	so how many of these faults are getting tested	dev
audio_0_214375.wav	This block, that block supposed to get matched	dev
audio_0_60025.wav	three quarters minus one fourth times one fifth four pi r cube row over q	dev
audio_0_66784.wav	that means we are manufacturing the chips, we are testing them, then we are sending them to the market	dev
audio_0_105065.wav	Actually the gate oxide is extremely thin	dev
audio_0_108834.wav	So, if I keep on increasing V D S; then, channel will start getting narrowed like this which you can see from the figure, right over here and because the channel is getting narrow, what will happen	dev
audio_0_45487.wav	Epsilon delta x by 2 minus	dev
audio_0_153623.wav	so this is node one	dev
audio_0_69599.wav	it is only along the rows in which you can place the cells	dev
audio_0_137424.wav	And where different types of driving mechanism, the engine class are basically the different drive mechanism that can happen for that and if you look into that then in terms of the wheeled one you may have a two wheeler, you may have a three wheeler and you may have a four wheeler these are the different options	dev

audio_0_209746.wav	Now, name these points as a' and this point b'	dev
audio_0_215127.wav	Just take a moment and think of the cases when you present a long lesson to your students and think of the actions that your students do when they are following up your lesson	dev
audio_0_10096.wav	Then, I m common into sin omega t cos theta plus cos omega t sin theta, that is sin A cos B plus cos A sin B form	dev
audio_0_149928.wav	And therefore, both these factors they played their own significant role as far as mutation is concerned	dev
audio_0_35066.wav	But if somebody outside is using x and y and these values no longer exist then what happens is that for the outside person their code stops working, because we have changed an internal implementation of point	dev
audio_0_145637.wav	A good trademark as a mark that is easy to speak and spell, because at the end of the day a trader though he coins the trademark it should be used by the users or the general public	dev
audio_0_162818.wav	44 and that is taken as an issue price and it is also taken as a closing stock	dev
audio_0_167241.wav	So it repeats after every six time units and before it repeats, before the next instance comes, the first instance must have been over	dev
audio_0_136933.wav	So, I just choose to discuss them	dev
audio_0_145551.wav	So, they are creations of the mind, but it requires an effort to create these rights	dev
audio_0_64522.wav	so instead of using one, two, three, four, five, six, in this way i can use a numbering scheme which is more efficient: one, two, three, one, two, three, one two, three	dev
audio_0_184480.wav	Now this particular circuit, this particular amplifier will not need this common ground that is the nice thing about this amplifier ok	dev
audio_0_72283.wav	when they are fabricated there will be small difference in their parameters, right	dev
audio_0_7492.wav	It is 1 upon L 1 plus 1 upon L 2 plus up to plus up to 1 upon L N into t 0 t t 0 to t v dt plus i1 t 0 plus i2 t 0 plus your up to i N t 0 or you can write i is equal to 1 upon L eq t 0 to t v dt plus i t 0	dev
audio_0_135330.wav	Both are trying to do bubble sort using exactly the same strategy, the same algorithm; and, you can see the only difference they have between them, is the use of the IO header and the std name space	dev
audio_0_166009.wav	And T2 and T3 can undergo 5 units of inversion on account of T6 and T2 and T3 can undergo 5 units of inversion on account of T4 using the resource R2	dev
audio_0_175398.wav	We have to use the Z parameter equations to find out the values of I1 and I2	dev
audio_0_166124.wav	But then the task T1 has higher priority than task T2 because it has a shorter period and therefore T1 should be first taken up for scheduling	dev
audio_0_13826.wav	So, this is and this is initial condition that is that is why writing this is 0	dev
audio_0_200287.wav	So, again, you look at where V2 is, you pick the curve corresponding to V1 0, so let's say it is that one, then the slope there, slope of that curve at the operating point, that is equal to Y22	dev
audio_0_17814.wav	Understanding the things like not writing but understanding	dev
audio_0_37818.wav	That is true that I understand	dev
audio_0_14576.wav	So, 1000 ampere ton this is R 1 R 2 R 3, this way you have to compute phi 1 phi 2 phi 3, then look at this one this is plus, this is minus right like you please come to that diagram, when both the coils are excited	dev
audio_0_103651.wav	28 and I get the initial estimate of the total shear in wall A	dev
audio_0_46923.wav	Then it will be H naught 1 because H naught 1 then is the outgoing wave the wave has to be outgoing	dev
audio_0_50358.wav	So, I am now left the physical world away I have entered a mathematical world where I have created a new operator called del E which agrees with physical world for values of ex E y E z equal to 1	dev
audio_0_53257.wav	Now this used to give a open loop constant fixed duty cycle kind of a drive	dev
audio_0_44316.wav	For the integral equation then I have to discretize in frequency solve for each frequency put it together That this discretization frequency could say the answer	dev
audio_0_56127.wav	thus this is a way, physical way of looking at you that i talked about	dev
audio_0_128233.wav	We stayed away from the ground quartz story because it is very expensive and also it is not very locally available if I want to ask ready mix company to manufacture UHPC they will manufacture only with the locally available materials	dev
audio_0_75169.wav	40 so you can find it out as there is the standard cost of standard cost of standard output standard cost of standard output is how much 8 tons at the rate of rupees how much it is given to us is 40	dev
audio_0_155567.wav	96 angle 22	dev
audio_0_194583.wav	So if I have a magnetic field line like this it will actually complete part through this	dev
audio_0_140906.wav	So, to be able to effectively use a programming language, you need a basic library to be available	dev
audio_0_48048.wav	So, the known terms for example, I know n, I know epsilon r, I know H incident	dev
audio_0_64136.wav	but structure techniques can totally solve the problem, as i have just now mentioned there	dev
audio_0_67429.wav	so any finite set machine that means ah synchronous sequential circuit can be modeled as follows	dev
audio_0_147589.wav	Let us talk about the motor interface that I shall be showing you in this experiment	dev
audio_0_152154.wav	Before taking the example ah it will find some interesting things	dev

audio_0_60619.wav	so now we are interested to know the value of magnetic susceptibility, chi, m, inside that superconductor	dev
audio_0_142580.wav	So, and signature and date which again form 2 had mentioned that it shall end with the date and the signature	dev
audio_0_46218.wav	Now, what are the properties of these observers it is a strange game	dev
audio_0_121333.wav	This kind of a structure can then be incorporated with mirrors in order to produce the lasing action	dev
audio_0_4287.wav	8 it is milliAmpere, 180	dev
audio_0_102663.wav	In this case we're really looking at the ultimate condition	dev
audio_0_149639.wav	Say for instance, perhaps one of the best examples could be where you have set a target for yourself, example that we took in the previous lecture that you have set the target of achieving say the president medal or say scholar batch after attaining the highest possible score in your group, but then it is not only the goal that matter it	dev
audio_0_40050.wav	The error term is what I am talking about how does the error behave as a function of the discretization	dev
audio_0_19739.wav	We were working on a particular company’s product of an app and seeing where they use this app all our customers insights we had digitized and mapped it based on this	dev

audio_0_106466.wav	This is 5 inch mask	dev
audio_0_194738.wav	So let me say may be I am going to have a North Pole like this after that I am going to have a South Pole again I am going to have North Pole and I am going to have a South Pole please understand this is essentially stator, whatever I am talking about is stator Poles	dev
audio_0_176422.wav	Now in matrix form how we will represent	dev

audio_0_102667.wav	You apply partial safety factors to both the structural material and to the load	dev
audio_0_18484.wav	How would you describe this repository saying these are the things that we absolutely want, these are the things that we should, we can have sort of a feature	dev
audio_0_201408.wav	Because you know this is a straight line	dev
audio_0_113540.wav	VDS we start from here VDS and in direction like this	dev
audio_0_169603.wav	This person has a certain lack of respect for the opinions of other people, also has certain stubbornness and would not be open to the suggestions of other people	dev
audio_0_140382.wav	This was the call and this is what the function is generated the compiler has generated these are call what has being generated this is what is been generating the static time	dev
audio_0_159737.wav	Dividend means what happens is company earns profit	dev
audio_0_65226.wav	so what will clock one say	dev
audio_0_198636.wav	So, we are going to do the same thing for getting the open circuit characteristic	dev
audio_0_31665.wav	While we can use this, the while statement to simulate the 'for statement' it is much nicer to use the 'for', where it is natural where we know in advance what exactly we are repeating over	dev
audio_0_151833.wav	So, in that case for for ah purpose of explanation if V C is equal to 1	dev
audio_0_45644.wav	So, we will see that the same logic there is nothing special there is no special preference to space over time	dev
audio_0_56782.wav	you can also show with these amplitudes that the energy coming in is equal to the energy reflected plus energy transmitted, which is required by energy conservation	dev
audio_0_170926.wav	Human touch always intensifies experiences	dev
audio_0_110302.wav	So, for this again we go back to we go to the the this particular table, right	dev
audio_0_139359.wav	Since the last module, we have been discussing on inheritance; we have noted that inheritance is a basic mechanism in C++ of modelling, encoding, there is a relationship of object oriented programming, the generalization and specialization relationship	dev

audio_0_184411.wav	We were waiting for this for a long time	dev
audio_0_49985.wav	So, far is boundary conditions I have not yet use the boundary conditions right	dev
audio_0_139934.wav	In terms of member functions again, we will see that there are very key ideas that come in	dev
audio_0_67.wav	So, at the time of start what you do that this resistance should be at maximum and then you start there what you call that you are then you give the supply	dev
audio_0_4581.wav	So, if you take any value from here, you will find X L greater than X C	dev
audio_0_167660.wav	A transient overload occurs when a task takes more time than it is estimated or maybe too many tasks arise at some time instant	dev
audio_0_173298.wav	Each displacement is represented by separate node	dev
audio_0_172021.wav	It is difficult is case of wye connected or star connected because it is not always possible to have neutral which is accessible from outside for the connection, so that is why the balanced delta connected load is more feasible for reconfiguring or taking any leg out or doing the changes in the delta connected load	dev
audio_0_107494.wav	Then I see that the input offset current for typical 741 is 200 nano ampere maximum as the matching between into input terminals is improved the difference between Ib1 and Ib2 become smaller that is the input offset current value decreases further right	dev
audio_0_53017.wav	So this will be around 9 modes	dev
audio_0_171348.wav	He holds eye contact with her	dev
audio_0_151783.wav	If delta dash is ah very small; that means, cosine delta dash approximately one; that means, you can write that equation V S dash is equal to V R plus I r ah sin theta plus I x l your sin theta right this much was already there minus your I x c sin theta right; that means, earlier without series capacitor approximate thing was this was this was approximate voltage drop	dev
audio_0_103905.wav	We go to the third stage which is the ultimate stage of the demand and the capacity of the wall which is toe crushing itself	dev
audio_0_160490.wav	Now, a concept of continuous monitoring, periodical auditing, verification and vouching existed even in ancient times	dev
audio_0_35649.wav	Now, this is a very common paradigm in python and other programming languages where you want to take a name say z, and then you want to shift it by some amount, say z plus 6 or z is equal to z minus 6	dev
audio_0_115238.wav	So, this particular GOT entry corresponds to the func	dev
audio_0_82222.wav	Now at that time, for example, if the Airtel was not able to match the pricing of the geo or the idea and Boudafone were not able to match the pricing of geo, so there is the one option in their mind was to go out of that sector	dev
audio_0_213902.wav	) Hello everyone	dev
audio_0_43250.wav	So, in contrast to the far field case the magnetic fields are going as 1 by r squared the electric fields are going as 1 by r cube right 1 by r cube reminds us of what from electrostatics	dev

audio_0_92509.wav	So here either the customer he will not get the desired system or what will happen, the customer will over pay because the work is less and he may pay more than the that is desirable in regard to the work that or the service that he is getting so this approach may seem very much unethical and on business like because as you have seen that the cost they do not accurately reflect the volume of the work required so it um this approach may seem to be unethrical and on business like however when the detailed information regarding the volume of work etc is lacking then this method may be the only appropriate strategy	dev
audio_0_194261.wav	What is the problem with this	dev
audio_0_132473.wav	When I do that then I say I am doing explicit conversion and the reason I do explicit conversion could be many for example, it could be that implicit conversion is making a conversion which is not what I want	dev

audio_0_76923.wav	So, we are again having the three figures or four figures in the outer column, one is cost of raw material consumed, direct wages, direct other expenses and finally the prime cost	dev
audio_0_139868.wav	So, these designate the classes and this arrow which ends with open triangle at the end means specialization	dev
audio_0_34612.wav	It turns out that for mutable values assignment does not make a fresh copy	dev
audio_0_87944.wav	We have talked about how to separate different kind of neurons and 2 process processes what we have discussed in depth, which are kind of you know can be followed by any lab at any point of time is a density gradient centrifugation	dev
audio_0_125934.wav	Now the problem with these 2 sets of equations, this set that I derived previously, that I had stated previously and this another set, so these were all ports matched, these were for reciprocity and this was the condition for losslessness	dev
audio_0_143086.wav	You should understand this scope of this act in the light of an age old exception that was there in patent laws	dev
audio_0_209778.wav	So, we are going to construct one more inclined plane that inclined vertical plane at 60 degrees we are going to draw	dev
audio_0_39422.wav	0; therefore, U 1 U 4 and U 5 will they appear in this they will not appear they get multiplied by 0	dev
audio_0_84625.wav	So, we had 9,000 budget, actual performance 7,000, so we created a budget for 7,000 so that this budget, flexible budget for the 7,000 units becomes the benchmark to compare the actual performance of the 7,000 units manufactured and sold in the market	dev
audio_0_137069.wav	But, if I do call by reference, then the potential is that any changes made to the formal parameter will also get reflected in the actual parameter	dev
audio_0_63532.wav	so if you do a simple, if you do a simple ah means arithmetic on this the expression come to t skew jitter plus t logic setup plus t skew jitter	dev
audio_0_82858.wav	This works out as 1,19,200	dev
audio_0_203707.wav	And we have the two port voltages VGS, gate source voltage and VDS drain source voltage	dev
audio_0_163667.wav	5 and company B has current ratio of 1	dev
audio_0_169547.wav	Stalter has commented that in comparison to our legs and feet, our facial expressions as well as our hands and even our fingers have a better and more conscious control	dev
audio_0_101667.wav	You don't want high strength steels because higher the strength more is the demand that's going to go on to the masonry, the masonry part before the steel can yield and that can imply crushing failure before the steel yields	dev
audio_0_15933.wav	So, this is that your what you call current going like this going like this going like this is 4 ampere	dev
audio_0_68136.wav	so any movement towards right or towards top will not increase the detour number	dev
audio_0_124936.wav	So our lumped element model has been given	dev
audio_0_144389.wav	So, thankfully we do not have that arrangement what we have is the fact that the courts will look into factors whether a work is being infringed or not and the court will not look into the quality of a work when it comes to determining disputes on copyright	dev
audio_0_153347.wav	Because you know that motor starting current maybe 2	dev
audio_0_4166.wav	If you just make all , magnitude right I just	dev
audio_0_205255.wav	So, it is not a complete sketch, only lines I have constructed, not a closed one	dev
audio_0_27114.wav	2 into 10 to the power 4 sorry right So I was so after calculating we can find out value as around 4 millimetre which is less than 27	dev
audio_0_63568.wav	this will also depend on setup time	dev
audio_0_34988.wav	Initially, we have a heap which has n elements	dev
audio_0_102345.wav	So it is in that context we will start examining hysteretic behavior and though some of you may not be familiar with cyclic response, static cyclic response is what we are trying to capture here	dev
audio_0_167324.wav	So, this is a very random event occurs very rarely but then this is a high priority event	dev
audio_0_157964.wav	This neural firing travels to the brain through the auditory pathway and the child senses that he is listening to this melodious sound of the bird	dev
audio_0_137505.wav	So, if you look into std colon colon C in, the input operator then a it means that is being read by C in	dev
audio_0_56814.wav	so that means cos theta is positive, i am moving from lower to higher potential, right	dev
audio_0_153810.wav	And for example, in distribution system you have just just for the purpose of this thing for a distribution system suppose total load is this one and TQL suppose you have that ah total your P L, say P L I is equal to say nominal load that mean initially load was P L i right multiplied by some factor alpha	dev
audio_0_116728.wav	Now, in order to use this library we have written a driver program which is present in driver	dev
audio_0_152957.wav	Generally that it is connected to the your your what you call yeah frequency of the system if it is a 50 hertz or 60 hertz that frequency is generally not changing that way right it is around nominal frequency, but sometimes little less than 50 sometimes a little more than 50 right	dev
audio_0_184046.wav	So, this is a low resistance, small resistance, low resistance with 2 terminals which I am drawing as 2 knobs 2 circles	dev
audio_0_55794.wav	In the case the inductor current, this line would be the I 0 line	dev
audio_0_42426.wav	Not z its a 2 D there is no z and within this I have you know my variables are like this	dev

audio_0_145622.wav	A matter that is same or similar to an already existing mark	dev
audio_0_204582.wav	In lecture 3, we try to look at basic dimensions of a technical drawing and the layout of a drawing sheet and we have ended the lecture 3 with basic dimensions and their terminology	dev
audio_0_114896.wav	Further we subtract 8 bytes from ECX which is an offset in the GOT table which contains the actual address of mylib int	dev
audio_0_31874.wav	The first type of control flow which we have seen is conditional execution and the other type is loops	dev
audio_0_40060.wav	I am just rewriting here bringing the f prime z naught term on one side everything else on the other side I am not done anything so	dev
audio_0_104814.wav	I will need a high pass, I will need a low pass, and I have to use an active, means, an op amp	dev
audio_0_165011.wav	That's their main right	dev
audio_0_115099.wav	So, in today’s video lecture we will be looking at another form of side channel attack known as a fault attack	dev
audio_0_102914.wav	So now we are going to be looking at in plain action, looking at shear wall behavior in masonry and it's not that shear is not going to act in the out of plane direction in a masonry wall	dev
audio_0_15859.wav	So, that is 1 watt from this equation 1 watt is equal to your 1 joule per second it is one joule per second right	dev
audio_0_51401.wav	So, I have no control over where the source is, but now if I introduce the if I introduce a lossy layer incident will continues to be at gamma nothing changes right	dev
audio_0_53628.wav	So the inductor will charge up this capacitance in this way through the capacitor and the load and then go from T to P	dev
audio_0_35561.wav	The first is the function, the second is the argument, and the third is the number of times, the repetitions	dev
audio_0_8569.wav	So, this is known to us this equation you are familiar with these from your higher secondary physics	dev
audio_0_69796.wav	but again, i said for standard cell, this kind of vertical rotation does not make a sense	dev
audio_0_55166.wav	Some people may like this background fine but I would prefer to have a light background and I would like to have the default GSM opening with light BG	dev
audio_0_47117.wav	So, this system is like 2 homogeneous for determinant	dev
audio_0_63572.wav	right so this setup and hold times, these are characteristics of the storage elements and these are something which are not under the designers control	dev
audio_0_115407.wav	This seems to be much less than 1 bit per second but nevertheless we see that attackers are quite motivated, and the rate of transmission is not a very critical issue for attackers as long as the information can be obtained on the other side	dev
audio_0_167103.wav	So, we have given this simple example here	dev
audio_0_163976.wav	Now, what we will do is we know the cost and we also know that the estimated working hours are 40,000	dev
audio_0_64125.wav	so essentially the d f t techniques which are used so one of them we will be discussing here they try to make the internal flip flops easily controllable and observable	dev
audio_0_192339.wav	You have the field current now IF dash	dev
audio_0_215261.wav	Have leader boards	dev
audio_0_118947.wav	The value of mu e and mu h are given; mu e is 3900 and mu h is 1900 centimeter square per volt per second, so that sigma is nothing but 0	dev
audio_0_195976.wav	So if I say that phi and I are not directly related to each other in some portions of the magnetization characteristics, I should say correspondingly phi by I is roughly representing the inductance, of course I have removed the N, number of turns I have removed, that is approximately representing the inductance	dev
audio_0_162280.wav	Though it is other income, it is not going to recur every year	dev
audio_0_14085.wav	So, this method used used for controlling the speed of the series motor is to vary the field flux by varying the your, excitation current because, the excitation current means the field current right	dev
audio_0_185487.wav	But, now once again here the question that we will ask is given V 1 if V 1 is given V o output is how much how to find V o ok, how to find it we need the static characteristic so, that is the input output relationship	dev
audio_0_33654.wav	So, along this purple diagonal c plus r is equal to 6 everywhere, and along this green diagonal we have 7 plus 5, 6 plus 6 and 5 plus 7	dev
audio_0_137821.wav	Main will construct local objects; use the static as well as local objects, till the scope of main ends	dev

audio_0_174877.wav	Your Norton’s equivalent impedance is 5 ohm	dev
audio_0_180800.wav	So, roughly; so I have 2 cycles of input signal within this	dev
audio_0_42277.wav	So, now I am talking about the PML region where I am going to write this Maxwell’s equation	dev
audio_0_186450.wav	So in case of government hospitals where the services services are provided almost free they do not look too much after the physical evidence many times the buildings are not well look after the plaster is falling the pipes are dripping the taps are not working etc but in for a private hospital these are very important factors and the hospital has to keep the buildings pathology labs pharmacy center etc in a spikanspan manner then comes the seven piece of the hospital services marketing there is the process so there are two types of processes in hospitals one is for outpatient and another is for inpatient for outpatient the process and the processes are meeting the doctor diagnosis treatment and medication whereas inpatient services there is for patient arrival registration diagnosis treatment future action related suggestions and discharge and payment	dev
audio_0_36171.wav	Now I need to also explore these squares for what I can reach from there	dev
audio_0_162950.wav	So, with this we will stop here	dev
audio_0_122670.wav	And, we saw that there were 2 types; the first one was called the Schottky Junction	dev
audio_0_79158.wav	Because if you don't have the sales target in your mind, you cannot know that how much production we can make, how much material is required for that production, how much other operating expenses may be variable or fixed are required for that	dev
audio_0_205685.wav	Whatever the thing we have projected that point a’ on the vertical plane	dev
audio_0_127991.wav	All the system that will talk about finish at the gate, gate meaning when the cement goes out of the cement plant ok	dev
audio_0_11493.wav	272; so, 1	dev
audio_0_111506.wav	You can see what I have in my hand, right	dev
audio_0_133489.wav	I need to convert, actually truncate that to main int	dev
audio_0_76504.wav	Direct expenses or the direct other expenses you can say	dev
audio_0_105252.wav	Actually, we areneed not usinge inverting amplifier and non inverting amplifier or we can use, the point is low pass high pass goes to buffer, buffer to a summing amplifier	dev
audio_0_215427.wav	Now, is that the right thing to do	dev
audio_0_100289.wav	And now this very nicely captures all the concepts that we've been examining earlier in our course as well	dev
audio_0_34310.wav	When we pass arguments to a function it is exactly like assigning values to a name	dev
audio_0_148971.wav	So, he said that the intellectual development is basically an evolution of cognitive processes such as understanding the law of nature, the principles of grammar and mathematical rules	dev
audio_0_106034.wav	The frequency response is the same formula and would be f c equal to one upon 2 pi R C, except that the amplitude of the signal is increased by the gain of the amplifier because here we have a non inverting amplifier	dev
audio_0_108502.wav	1 nano farad, right; 461, 464	dev
audio_0_192561.wav	If you may recall what we wrote earlier in three phase induction motor, we used to write R2 dash by S	dev
audio_0_112555.wav	It is all about understanding the concept	dev
audio_0_139104.wav	In this module and the next one, we would take a deep look into operator overloading for user defined types it is a connected discussion	dev
audio_0_210969.wav	Now, for any new drawing, we have to go to front plane, click normal to that	dev
audio_0_136985.wav	So, the swap did not work and this is to be expected	dev
audio_0_170049.wav	Welcome dear participants to the 3rd Module of the fourth week	dev
audio_0_212968.wav	Now, first of all we have to learn few key words in solidworks	dev
audio_0_128713.wav	So while test is running here you can see the load displacement behaviour of the strand and now you can see the load is linearly increasing and the force and the displacement are shown at the bottom of the screen, meanwhile reading will be taken, dial gauge reading will be taken at every 10 kilo Newton interval	dev
audio_0_123936.wav	VSWR less than 2 is considered a good matching or as we saw from the concept of impedance matching that when most of the incident power is transmitted to the load	dev
audio_0_135416.wav	Here, if you look into the, particularly the call of the sort function, you see that, the first two parameters are there, but the third parameter is not there that is, the compare function is not provided here	dev
audio_0_39741.wav	So, what is another simplifying assumption we could do	dev
audio_0_196177.wav	Now, what is available after this is going to come out as the useful output which will be Vt multiplied by IL this is what is the useful output that is available in the form of the load current multiplied by the terminal voltage that is the useful output power	dev
audio_0_69632.wav	now here, ah, of course your objective will be the minimize the overall layout area	dev
audio_0_199052.wav	2 volts, VGS minus VT is smaller than what is required, it is 1	dev
audio_0_71215.wav	so whatever i have just worked out with that example is explained here	dev
audio_0_120780.wav	So, this is what will happen if we have 3 Hydrogen atoms	dev
audio_0_83156.wav	This is going to be the only collection from the sales	dev
audio_0_4915.wav	So, this is that figure right, so 2 independent your voltage sources are there one dependent your current source is there right	dev
audio_0_64578.wav	the first one says: so you have a pair of points source and target which you want to connect	dev
audio_0_39156.wav	0 they will give you the TTL level output	dev
audio_0_71394.wav	so once you merge one and three, lets say you merge the two nodes or vertices, one and three together to form a one super vertex	dev
audio_0_83277.wav	Cost accounting answers all kind of the questions which are with regard to the costing of the production services and it certainly becomes the basis of pricing the products and services	dev
audio_0_40979.wav	So, you encounter any of these things you know they are talking about the same thing ok	dev
audio_0_192310.wav	Okay so 240 volts unsaturated shunt motors have an armature resistance including brushes and inter poles of 0	dev
audio_0_20619.wav	Yeah, it is a serious problem, I can understand	dev
audio_0_198422.wav	So by the time the rotor things of picking up speed, even aligning with the stator field, it is not even able to do that before that the stator field has already crossed almost 180 degrees	dev
audio_0_162438.wav	We get 0	dev
audio_0_42789.wav	Now, in order to implement this D because I will need this D to put it into the update equations right; what are the update equations	dev
audio_0_36083.wav	So, we get one from the top two from the bottom 3, 5, 7, 9, 11	dev
audio_0_164377.wav	Now the next one is dividend yield	dev
audio_0_5822.wav	So, d phi by d t, we can write d phi by d i into d i by d t right	dev
audio_0_141031.wav	Consider this a function, this is the functionality is not really very important we are calling this has a identity function that is it takes a parameter and simply returns the same parameter back	dev
audio_0_72588.wav	you see, suppose i have a function, any block, the output is f	dev
audio_0_116010.wav	So, we will open this and run GDB executable for the driver is dpic, so we run dpic as it is, as before we need to export the LD library path okay	dev
audio_0_51207.wav	So, this is also called the residue	dev
audio_0_17203.wav	So, when switch is closed for long time, so, that we have to find out	dev
audio_0_56504.wav	e raise to minus lambda r over r square times r unit vector, dot d s, which is going to be four pi r square, all in the radial direction	dev
audio_0_69383.wav	so, ah, lets count the pattern: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen patterns have been generated	dev
audio_0_176312.wav	Now Vf is the forced or steady state response so if you see from the figure which is the modified circuit when the switch is opened so the Vs the final value that is value of Vf is nothing but Vs because when the capacitor is charged to its value the current will be 0	dev
audio_0_117213.wav	In such cases the worst case situation is where we could actually have two units possibly designed independently and both inputs are sent into both of these units and verified at the output	dev
audio_0_215353.wav	You are creating so many new new things, for that you need to make sure that the technical content is accurate	dev
audio_0_83205.wav	This firm also has that if there is surplus they will deposit and if there is a short coming, means a shortfall they will be borrowing from the bank	dev
audio_0_140273.wav	When i becomes 1 I get the second record where I have the type as Mgr and which is 1, so I get the second function pointer and I invoke it with the pointer to the corresponding employee which is the manager record	dev
audio_0_114927.wav	Thus, the ECX register contains the address of this particular instruction, the addl instruction	dev
audio_0_82488.wav	So under these three sources banks are more concerned about that we are ready to give some funds to the industry, but since it is being given for the short term very short time period of time same time for a few months or maximum for a period of 12 months 1 year	dev
audio_0_197970.wav	Whereas if I am going to have rather, if the rotor excitation is less, it is less than phi needed, in which case it will require definitely to draw some amount of reactive current from the stator side as well, which will actually make up for any shortfall I had originally in the flux	dev
audio_0_124455.wav	Also in terms of omega 0, it can be written like this	dev
audio_0_171702.wav	Because in real scenario you will never get peak values as given in the equation or as defined in some experiment	dev
audio_0_4124.wav	So, you are what where to do if we have to measure the park phase basis right	dev
audio_0_212993.wav	That tool also comes either on the left side or right side based on how we are dragging and dropping at this suitable location, where you will see some of the things like whether we are going with assemblies, whether we have touched any features, whether we have given any annotation, all these details we will be having it	dev
audio_0_72203.wav	it looks like something like this: you see that here you have a clock source this might be coming from outside the chip	dev
audio_0_137796.wav	Now, here is a main function, but we have defined an object statically here	dev
audio_0_71181.wav	so the first four i can keep in the first partition, second in the other partition	dev
audio_0_56658.wav	what it means is: i have this wave propagating in the x direction, then e can have components	dev
audio_0_15914.wav	So, I suggest once again when we because later stage we will solve any problem is another thing	dev
audio_0_193630.wav	It is let us say I am just having you know in a room I am rotating the machine, right	dev
audio_0_164904.wav	Now what do you understand by it	dev
audio_0_100788.wav	Now in such a situation it basically implies that the compression capacity of the wall is inadequate	dev
audio_0_76748.wav	That will become the closing balance of the cash for the month of January	dev
audio_0_74292.wav	So, what is going to be the sales budget	dev
audio_0_136208.wav	Function invocation is always on the right hand side	dev
audio_0_57842.wav	and the current j, which is equal to minus d grade of row, is like a equivalent to the electric field and this row is equivalent to the potential	dev
audio_0_184629.wav	So, let this be x axis which is now will be equal to V N minus this V 2 by V 2 R 2 by R 1 plus R 2 ok	dev
audio_0_76839.wav	So, if you want to increase the profit you cannot touch the selling price because it is not determined by the firm	dev
audio_0_83534.wav	This amount is 16,367 which was the profit earned here	dev
audio_0_34420.wav	Now if we take an expression, which produces an int such as 7 times 1, i remain an int	dev
audio_0_214999.wav	At this stage the development team is unsure if they can make all these modifications and still meet the project deadlines	dev
audio_0_2173.wav	So, this side if you transform it, it will become 1 is to 1, it will become I2 dash is equal to I2 upon a	dev
audio_0_47249.wav	One grid to this one grid	dev
audio_0_152429.wav	89 now power factor is improved because of this 1000 kilo hour capacitor this power factor is improved, right	dev
audio_0_33754.wav	So, we have added this thing which says, end equal to space	dev
audio_0_153203.wav	The inertia constant H of each unit is 5 second 5	dev
audio_0_50764.wav	So, when I combine these two equations you will see this is the equation that I get ok	dev
audio_0_119059.wav	So, there is an energy spread to the spectrum, this energy spread is shown here and the spectrum or the actual intensity that is arriving at the earth is going to depend upon scattering from the atmosphere and also the incident angle of the radiation	dev
audio_0_46750.wav	I can put a check on how much numerical dispersion will be happening in my simulation ok	dev
audio_0_215363.wav	Right now there are multiple tools which are learning to do this	dev
audio_0_161471.wav	Bad dates and provisions for doubtful dates	dev
audio_0_179773.wav	So, what will happen in that case, the value of, the updated value of the resistance that is Rl plus delta R will cause a change in the load current	dev
audio_0_34040.wav	Unlike other programming languages, python does not have a specific character type to distinguish a single character from a string of length 1	dev
audio_0_5386.wav	So, only dependent source is there	dev
audio_0_71393.wav	if you feel that i and j are in some sense compatible, in the sense that they can be put on the same track, then you try to merge them	dev
audio_0_120529.wav	So, V naught is the built in potential or the barrier during equilibrium when you apply an external potential the barrier is Vo Vexternal when the barrier goes down it basically have minority carriers moving across the junction	dev
audio_0_105863.wav	What is the formula of an integrator	dev
audio_0_166176.wav	The main result that they gave is that we look at every task in the task set and then we assume zero phasing among the tasks	dev
audio_0_74305.wav	So, first part is the cash sales	dev
audio_0_198659.wav	So, this is giving you an indication of what is the internally generated voltage in a synchronous generator right	dev
audio_0_118996.wav	So, if there was a transition from the valence band to the conduction band, the maximum wavelength was defined by the band gap of the material	dev
audio_0_179224.wav	Now, in this session we will talk more about the basic concepts of electric circuits	dev
audio_0_171407.wav	Darting eyes are also associated with the line behavior of people however researches tell us that practiced liars have learnt to hold the gaze for a longer period	dev
audio_0_149737.wav	One very popular type of research that you find in psychology is the correlational type of research	dev
audio_0_65888.wav	so delays of the gates i can do by scaling down of the gates, making them smaller	dev
audio_0_163499.wav	So, you would like to show more profits	dev
audio_0_132841.wav	Similarly if I have private public, I will have private	dev
audio_0_136897.wav	If we increment a, it will become 11, so you can see here that a, has become 11	dev
audio_0_19577.wav	So, what this person told the rest of the hospital team is to pretend that he is one of the patients and just pretend the whole thing you know fake the whole thing as if he were one of the patient	dev
audio_0_46301.wav	So, you notice that your matrix elements over here these capital A’s are consisting of these kinds of terms right	dev
audio_0_31833.wav	One thing we have emphasized before and, I will say it again is that this indentation has to be uniform; in other words, it must be the same number of spaces	dev
audio_0_106674.wav	So, now, we understand right that if I apply input at inverting, output will be out of phase; if I apply signal at non inverting, output will be in phase	dev
audio_0_200401.wav	This is of course not true of all circuits in general	dev
audio_0_65351.wav	the naperian base of two point seven approximately	dev
audio_0_109596.wav	And played through a speaker it sounds like popcorn popping, and hence also called popcorn noise all right	dev
audio_0_139621.wav	And these are all as we know are C functions or more commonly global functions, and then I can use to print and if I do that the complex number will be printed out	dev
audio_0_132069.wav	So, for this code to work it is critical that we add the initial value of top marker through an assignment after the stack variable as been instantiated	dev

audio_0_135334.wav	I do that when I am trying to learn algorithms or when I am trying to learn the language, but subsequently if I want to sort a set of numbers I would not like to write the algorithm myself; rather, I will again go back to the standard library and try to use what standard library provides	dev
audio_0_90364.wav	And cell could be of 2 sources it could directly come from an animal which we call as Primary Cell directly from animal where is you have cell line, which are derived from animal and subculture derive from animal and here animal I even mean human being to derived from animal and subculture they are almost like generations after generations you are growing them unlimited or you cannot call it unlimited cell cycle	dev
audio_0_207445.wav	So, this was the demonstration for this tangent mate	dev

audio_0_133003.wav	So, the simple way to do this, I define the abs function and start using it, and the flip side of this is if we do that then, the abs function that exists in the C standard library is hidden, that is once I have defined my abs function, then the abs function that is available from the library is no more available	dev
audio_0_16870.wav	So, power variation is again double frequency because, this is actually double frequency 2 omega right and is equal to 0 because there is no resistor there	dev
audio_0_118138.wav	25 and 0	dev
audio_0_213160.wav	So, from K; mark an arc on AK line; with the same radius, from K as centre; mark another arc Q	dev

audio_0_20717.wav	So it is pretty useful for that purpose; otherwise, yeah,good thing for me will be to invest in companies which are making this but for now we will stick to the uses of design thinking for this purpose of customer journey mapping, ok	dev
audio_0_73276.wav	so whatever discussions and concepts we would be talking about, they would apply not only to digital circuits but also to this kind of mix signal and analog circuits as well	dev
audio_0_120964.wav	The probability of occupation p of e at t 1 is greater than t 2, which means higher the temperature, higher the probability of occupation	dev

audio_0_140233.wav	Similarly, I have for the next type the director type and these are three classes that we have	dev
audio_0_1443.wav	So, generally you your what we call that a simple your what you call three phase generator, we call alternator have been drawn here right	dev
audio_0_51259.wav	Yeah to get H total I add incident yeah But	dev
audio_0_41651.wav	So, let us look at the first term for a	dev
audio_0_76485.wav	For example in this total information all the information may not be of our use	dev
audio_0_46755.wav	So, we had one antenna like this let us call it antenna A ok, and what was this antenna A doing, it was radiating a field in free space	dev
audio_0_164517.wav	Suppose earning per share of a particular company is 10 rupees and it has a market price of 150 rupees so 150 upon 10 it means 15 times its earning is the market price now what does it tell you is it good to have high or P	dev
audio_0_105615.wav	We have we know this for the practical operation amplifiers, right	dev
audio_0_66031.wav	let say where you can actually rout your wires such that, or size the gates such that these delay values are actually achieved right	dev
audio_0_10701.wav	So, it has to be same right so that so this; that means, all calculations are correct if something goes wrong if it is not matching means somewhere your calculation is wrong right	dev
audio_0_134795.wav	So, in this expression we found out if each digit is ch, that is whether it is a digit can be an operand, single digit operand and then we push it otherwise we consider	dev
audio_0_116514.wav	Now, we have all of these ring oscillator outputs connected to multiplexers, so this is shown as two N by 2 bit multiplexers but we can actually have them as N bit multiplexers, and then you have counters and response which is of 1 bit	dev

audio_0_72650.wav	ok, and this decomposition we can carry out hierarchically, making the blocks smaller and smaller until we reach a stage where each of the blocks can be handled and designed independently	dev
audio_0_67629.wav	so the expression for r a t is just this: the, the r a t value of the output nodes minus the delay of the node, and you take the minimum of that right	dev
audio_0_105369.wav	Why now	dev
audio_0_127329.wav	So he was, you know he was not able to leave this industry at all	dev
audio_0_16177.wav	So, first you take it take 10 ohm resistance open	dev
audio_0_184662.wav	So, let us begin with very simple idea	dev
audio_0_211157.wav	So, there are some tools to see this visibility icon, we can see the origin of this, origin of each of the items, we can see origin of each items	dev
audio_0_111410.wav	It is very important because it will be used in a certain phase of your life directly or indirectly	dev
audio_0_11770.wav	So, it will be 10 i 1 it is 10 i 1 minus this 5 i 2, because it is it is we are moving this way we are moving this way, but it is going this way	dev
audio_0_79189.wav	Some are necessities, some are the comforts and some are the luxuries	dev
audio_0_183648.wav	So, this is the miniature version of this diagram ok	dev
audio_0_205850.wav	So, we can always construct a plane surface which is passing through these three points	dev
audio_0_109722.wav	50 milliwatt, it will be 50 into 25 into 10 raise to minus 6, because this is microampere 1	dev
audio_0_36820.wav	So, I wonder if these teenagers and all which; they might at a certain point of time may choose a different trajectory to get into repetitive thought process	dev
audio_0_177184.wav	So, loads are Zl1, Zl2 and Zl3 voltage sources are having same frequency and same RMS voltage, but the phase values are different	dev
audio_0_47287.wav	I can as well write it as like this gradient of f is equal to x hat, y hat and z hat	dev

audio_0_170385.wav	The speed of this pitch is also related in many ways with the content we have to deliver	dev
audio_0_100793.wav	So, in case the tension control criterion is not satisfied, when you then proceed to estimate A, if the under root is negative negative then there is a physical implication which has to be addressed which is lack of compression capacity which requires a change in the design strength or the cross section of the wall	dev
audio_0_4850.wav	So, using node voltage method determine v 1 and v 2 of the circuit shown in figure 32 the chapter 3	dev
audio_0_81902.wav	So, this assumption is here also, this assumption was there also at both the places assumption is same	dev
audio_0_110639.wav	So, this is how I can find my average input bias current; that is how can I find my average input bias current, all right	dev
audio_0_38844.wav	it will be a reset; so, if you apply a high pulse to the reset line then the micro controller will reset	dev
audio_0_211047.wav	Now, I am moving my mouse in the counter clockwise direction, then click the option, then it construct it	dev
audio_0_82700.wav	And on the credit side we'll put the information with regard to the sales	dev

audio_0_205020.wav	Here we are showing leader line this is also a radial line	dev
audio_0_136551.wav	That is a reference to the class as input or parameter and reference to that class as a return type for the output, so that you can make this kind of a change assignment possible	dev
audio_0_76842.wav	As I told you the success mantra or the decision making rule in the management accounting we follow is the cost and benefit	dev
audio_0_72195.wav	the second strategy is that, well, let us not not try to bring them close together, but let us try to balance the delays	dev
audio_0_73197.wav	well, the first approach will consider only inter connection length, but later on we shall see that not only inter connection length, we can also calculate the parasitics	dev
audio_0_33743.wav	There is some mistake in that, but there is an extra column, but basically you can see that if you ignore the last column which is showing the position of the queens in the first 8 queen solution	dev
audio_0_111999.wav	Output resistance, is the resistance between the output terminal and ground	dev
audio_0_34295.wav	So you take n and multiply it by all the numbers smaller than itself up to 1 and by definition 0 factorial is defined to be 1	dev
audio_0_177763.wav	So, when you will say when you will see the root of minus 1 you can simply represent with the complex variable j	dev
audio_0_4167.wav	So, if you just put all these values from the magnitude of this current and the resistive value you will get 2067 Watt here also 2067 watt	dev
audio_0_48695.wav	R prime	dev
audio_0_175220.wav	First is Loop gain, so loop gain is the product of branch gains formed by traversing the path that starts at a node and ends at the same node without passing through any other node more than once and following the direction of the signal flow	dev
audio_0_212059.wav	So, divide the complete CF into 7 equal parts 7 parts we have to divide and once we divide that into 7 parts mark V at the fourth division from centre C	dev

audio_0_115230.wav	So, for an example func at PLT has an entry in the PLT table which is this	dev
audio_0_175896.wav	Being a sinusoidal you will always get the average value of either voltage or current as 0, so that’s why it is not advisable to keep the value of voltage and current in terms of average value that’s why you will always see either the value of voltage and current is specified as maximum or rms value	dev
audio_0_79133.wav	In case of the labor efficiency variance what you will do here standard rate per hour into standard rate per hour into standard rate per hour into standard time for actual output standard time for actual output standard time for actual output standard time for actual output, standard time for actual output minus actual time paid for, These are the three variances and then the labor idle time variance	dev
audio_0_192603.wav	Within this 20 millisecond period if I try to look at it, speed will be almost like a constant	dev
audio_0_43698.wav	So, one popular way of doing it is that you take your so let us say your solution that you got at resolution N	dev
audio_0_171168.wav	This is a very significant research by Ekman and Friesen, because we find that the latest technological developments in the area of robotics etcetera are also using this basic finding by Ekman and Friesen	dev
audio_0_67634.wav	i am assuming that the r a t value is five point five	dev
audio_0_146136.wav	There you can use this MVN instruction	dev
audio_0_83430.wav	So, if any unit's cost has gone beyond the budget order budgeted or pre determined cost that unit can be held responsible for that increase in the cost and they can be alarmed that it should not happen in future	dev
audio_0_147028.wav	Thus, there will be an overshoot like this here, here and then when you turn off the heater the temperature will again slowly start to go down	dev
audio_0_126829.wav	Now, what happens is when I said that whenever a wavelength of a signal is comparable to the dimensions surface the circuit, you have this microwave distributed lines what you call as distributed line effect	dev
audio_0_167122.wav	The second constraint on the frame size is that the frame size must divide the major cycle or the hyper period	dev

audio_0_195117.wav	So the topic that we are going to cover under transformer basically are, let me talk about today first, I will be talking about types based on both applications as well as contraction and single phase and three phase these are the various types we will be talking about	dev
audio_0_142107.wav	Acts of infringement	dev
audio_0_152848.wav	78 degree right this is your after first iteration after first iteration	dev
audio_0_76002.wav	I'm going to be the	dev
audio_0_63106.wav	we just looked at, ah, the netlist requirement, the sizes of the blocks, position of the pins and so on, and our objective was to minimize the layout size and minimize the interconnection length or cost some weighted sum of the two	dev
audio_0_178620.wav	So per phase, real power you will get VpIp cos theta	dev
audio_0_178855.wav	Namaskar, so in last session we started our discussion about the 3 phase circuits and last we discussed about the star star balance circuit that means you can also say Wye Wye balance circuit	dev
audio_0_64112.wav	so in the last lecture we talked about test pattern generation, how we can generate tests	dev
audio_0_18714.wav	You know, what really turns them on	dev
audio_0_84658.wav	It can be ignored also but this is very important for us because the variance between the same level of budget and same level of the actual performance should not be there	dev
audio_0_106306.wav	So, you understand tissue, we have a well, we have inter digitated electrodes	dev
audio_0_146564.wav	But these are the following steps that need to be followed when you are using this particular STM board	dev
audio_0_109077.wav	When we talk about active high pass filter, we have to use active component, and active component is nothing but our Op Amp	dev
audio_0_79894.wav	That is actually the purpose of budgeting	dev
audio_0_111634.wav	So, this is thehow you can you can apply different waveforms, right	dev
audio_0_159907.wav	Now, as far as the P&L account is concerned, I am once again taking you to P&L, start with net profit and go back adjusting these items as for our format	dev
audio_0_69690.wav	we melt the to a high temperature for it is converted into liquid, and then you follow a cooling sequence	dev
audio_0_102641.wav	So as far as an example for the working stress method which is alive and active are the Indian standards 1905 which deals with unreinforced masonry and the National Building Code 2016 where the reinforced masonry design is addressed	dev
audio_0_103646.wav	28 kiloons	dev
audio_0_104885.wav	So now, I help you to understand what exactly this band pass filter is, and we have seen how you can design a passive band pass filter by using the high pass filter and low pass filter by integrating high pass filter and low pass filter together in passive way it becomes passive band pass filter	dev
audio_0_68403.wav	clock is there, of course, but here, whenever we look at the charging and discharging of the capacitor, see, it is not only the output node, see all the other internal nodes of this gate, like here, there is another junction out here	dev
audio_0_59216.wav	i know that e reflected, for whatever we derived in the lecture through boundary conditions is nothing, but earlier we wrote it for the string v two minus v one over v two plus v one, which could also be written as n one minus n two over n one plus n two times o e incident e incident	dev
audio_0_79101.wav	So you should not measure fire your labor or you should not assume or should not mean conclude that the labor is non responsible, non productive	dev
audio_0_3398.wav	Suppose, if it is 12 to 20 volt, that is basically rms value unless and until it is not mentioned and if it say 224 AC, you have to assume this is rms value	dev
audio_0_165098.wav	For example, most of the banks, chairman is different, CEO is different	dev
audio_0_132131.wav	Just note carefully that in the initialization we first write the name of the data member and then within a pair of parenthesis we write the value that we want to use it as an initialization	dev
audio_0_106128.wav	So, I will catch you in the next class in the next particular module and then we will see how the op amp circuits can be used as a band pass filter till then take care, bye	dev
audio_0_166641.wav	So, the solution to this is a periodic server technique	dev
audio_0_3163.wav	So, that is for t greater than 0	dev
audio_0_180084.wav	So, this is off, then this voltage will increase which will make this output high after a while ok	dev
audio_0_35180.wav	So here is another example	dev
audio_0_142577.wav	It is just reiterating what is already covered in the specification	dev
audio_0_201067.wav	The gate you can only apply the input, it can only control	dev
audio_0_215477.wav	So, without wasting more time let us just start getting into some of the examples	dev
audio_0_159223.wav	If you have still not understood it, please read it two, three times	dev
audio_0_57702.wav	now higher the conductivity, higher the magnetic moment, higher the radius and thickness of the shell	dev
audio_0_102438.wav	So these two failure modes, of course, as I said, mixed modes are possible and you will see a body of literature that tries to understand how to capture the capacity and the failure mechanism if you have a combination of modes	dev
audio_0_80426.wav	Once the agreement is or terms are agreed by the supplier and the buyer	dev
audio_0_178499.wav	We have to utilize our the knowledge of Thevenin's theorem and we need to find out what would be the open circuit voltage across terminal a and b	dev
audio_0_143766.wav	Now intellectual property and intellectual property rights that is IP and IPR are in most places used interchangeably and there is nothing wrong with that, because many a times when we talk about intellectual property we also want to cover or encompass the corresponding rights	dev
audio_0_64343.wav	now the thing is that in the single instruction you are actually carrying out thirty two and operations there are thirty two bits	dev
audio_0_215739.wav	So, you give them the first five to ten slides and say I am going to present your content	dev
audio_0_37154.wav	The second is what we use to call neurotic depression which we called as dysthymia is a low amount of depression and people continue to function and all these difference depressions vary from what we call endogenous depression, which is the part of recurrent depressive disorder, where people keep having episodes of depression with or without reason right	dev
audio_0_40908.wav	Simply f m right	dev
audio_0_51647.wav	Plus j omega t ok; so, does that tell you anything	dev
audio_0_128496.wav	And we can calculate what this means in terms of the water here	dev
audio_0_174155.wav	Now, another important thing which you have to keep in mind that maximum power theorem is sometimes misinterpreted	dev
audio_0_101660.wav	This is far lesser than what is prescribed as minimum cover for reinforced concrete construction, primarily because we are already placing it within the unit	dev
audio_0_134977.wav	Now, as you will find that the whole advantage that we want to take by modeling inheritance, by modeling the generalization specialization hierarchy, by introducing features of overriding member functions and so on will be lost, if the derived class cannot access any part of the base class, which the base class protects from everyone else	dev
audio_0_124323.wav	Even though it has two conductors, the modes are not strictly TEM	dev
audio_0_109158.wav	So, if you see there are lot of probes, always a longer one is connected to the input, and the shorter one is connected to the probe	dev
audio_0_53993.wav	So this is one important waveform which I wanted to show you	dev
audio_0_45076.wav	Sorry yeah	dev
audio_0_41629.wav	So, that can be a that is a strategy meant to get a good initial guess, that is correct and let us say a good idea	dev
audio_0_154240.wav	36 degree and V4 is equal to 0	dev
audio_0_16905.wav	So, switch is closed and initial value of V C 0 plus is given 3 volt it is given	dev
audio_0_209533.wav	So, normal to that direction if we are observing this, what we are going to see is this part and this part	dev
audio_0_55509.wav	So basically a step down as the name indicates converts the input voltage into a lower output voltage	dev
audio_0_185945.wav	So, let us make a square forearms say, I will give the input here and say the meter will be connected across the other two terminals ok	dev
audio_0_6366.wav	So, this equation you divided by R 2 so, basically your i 2 is equal to v upon R 2	dev
audio_0_64046.wav	say, after this propagation delay and the delay of this or this output of d two becomes one because q one is as become one after the delay of or this output of war becomes one	dev
audio_0_205681.wav	So, somewhere 10, 20, 30 here and 20 units above; that means, 1 2 units	dev
audio_0_170740.wav	They easily suggest class for example, a particular topping on a pizza signifies a taste in Italy whereas, ordering a frozen pizza in a supermarket signifies a fast and cheap home cooked meal	dev
audio_0_84005.wav	You can miss this equation involves four important things and if any three things are given to us, we can easily calculate the fourth thing	dev
audio_0_215829.wav	Now, if everybody starts making errors you imagine what the entire screen will look like and all modules one learner will be taking	dev
audio_0_131020.wav	I am going to show you how, how that similar method as we did in the, like this so similar way we will do the same test and then you see how, when that significant increase, the significantly increase in the corrosion current or inverse polarisation resistance and based on which you will doÖ Similar test after that, after this we will just do some chemical test on the motor powder which is collected from the adjacent to the steel in the specimen	dev
audio_0_167326.wav	Can we handle this periodic tasks in a better way	dev
audio_0_215237.wav	Because SMEs are very very busy	dev
audio_0_106611.wav	And here actually this is our next class	dev
audio_0_57624.wav	i have here a lot of l e d's connected	dev
audio_0_132917.wav	This is where we saw over this hierarchy, how does the access of different members actually again I have shown it all for the data members, but the similar reason you will apply for the member functions as well, how will this different forms of inheritance interact with the difference specifier will is clear in terms of the member functions	dev
audio_0_83217.wav	And largely, it remains a negative balance because we have borrowings are more than the deposits we make	dev
audio_0_185181.wav	Now, when will this factor be close to 1	dev
audio_0_208524.wav	So, we do not show it by any hatch; wherever material has been removed that part we will show it by hatched lines	dev
audio_0_19392.wav	So we did the five whys, we saw new things that we did with the whys the n compared to what I had demonstrated, that was the multi forked whys that you saw, that is often used also, so you could try that as well	dev
audio_0_174568.wav	Now, although the interconnected network can be described by any of the 6 parameter sets, what were those	dev
audio_0_67696.wav	so whichever path is having a negative slack, this is our way of identifying which path is critical, because you see, there can be millions of paths	dev
audio_0_125952.wav	The magnetic fields however are concentric to these electric fields	dev
audio_0_11125.wav	I have made the approximation one right	dev
audio_0_212618.wav	For that purpose what I have to do is the first always the first part is a 2D one	dev
audio_0_179051.wav	So if you put the value s as infinity this will become zero	dev
audio_0_12147.wav	So, ah if you if you look, if you look into that the capacitor acts an open circuit acts as an open circuit right	dev
audio_0_167918.wav	It is an analysis of micro expressions and body language	dev
audio_0_149566.wav	But, if Sultan could fit those two sticks together and hold it, then the length of the arm plus the length of the first stick plus the length of the second stick, this length would be help Sultan reach the banana	dev
audio_0_75934.wav	And finally, we go for the financing arrangements	dev
audio_0_116589.wav	On the other hand, if the clock in fact has arrived 1st when the clock transitions from 0 to 1, it would see that the D is still at the value of 0 and therefore the output Q would obtain a value of 0	dev
audio_0_94769.wav	So changing of the technology also puts barrier for software for project estimation	dev
audio_0_195003.wav	And I am going to have very low hysteresis and eddy current loss in a transformer, hysteresis loss I don’t have much control but eddy current loss I am decreasing as much as possible	dev
audio_0_125667.wav	Since this is now potentially unstable, instead of GT Max we will have a GTmin that is the minimum value of the transducer power gain	dev
audio_0_210727.wav	Using drafter, one can easily construct these horizontal lines, in that way measure from this centre on	dev
audio_0_141548.wav	Suppose, I have given it a name land line phone and for the call functionality, I have introduced a call method, call member function in the class and to be able to call we need the number that we have to call	dev
audio_0_2878.wav	So, that is 20 upon 31 and tau tau you got 6 by 7 second you substitute you will get 20 upon 31 e to the power minus 7 t upon 6 ampere	dev
audio_0_109186.wav	So, the output voltage would be (5 / √2)	dev
audio_0_78851.wav	If you talk about the rent, the rent is same 160, 160, 160 is there so there is no variance	dev
audio_0_134293.wav	Now, if I want to so a max will have a signature of max, I have one value, I have other value, I have the results	dev
audio_0_150265.wav	In fact, I should say that like most of the test in psychology where you have you the normative interpretation	dev
audio_0_147625.wav	And this output of the opto coupler is fed to digital input pin default, because this will be a digital output, either 0 or 1, indicating an interruption or no interruption	dev
audio_0_41070.wav	Yeah, because they are all going this way there is no swirling around over here	dev
audio_0_137080.wav	But, I am saying that the reference x is constant; which means that no change of x is possible	dev
audio_0_160661.wav	So, government, US government failed in proper monitoring	dev
audio_0_155186.wav	3027, but I square r method here it is coming 60	dev
audio_0_135624.wav	Then finally, comes the question that if we have an array of a union	dev
audio_0_214693.wav	Effective integration of ICT is often interpreted as ICT function as an integral or a mediated tool to accomplish specific teaching and learning our activities to meet certain instructional objectives	dev
audio_0_217173.wav	you can see now she publishers and it says it has published the data here and we should be able to see it here	dev
audio_0_133750.wav	What it means that you have multiple functions overloaded	dev
audio_0_77550.wav	So, you go for these 6 ratios or you calculate these first 3 ratios, current ratio, quick ratio and super quick ratio	dev
audio_0_138248.wav	5 will be the initial value of i m	dev
audio_0_12126.wav	So, here i 1 0 plus is equal to i c 0 plus plus i 2 0 plus	dev
audio_0_128628.wav	So here we compare the two different techniques for the different sample ages and you can see the MIP is measuring the voids, the voids which are created by the chemical shrinkage, it is measuring the blue part which is the capillary pores you measure by NMR and for some reason a little bit of this gel pores	dev
audio_0_214442.wav	Using Q and R as centers construct one more perpendicular bisector passing through P, so that S point we will be in a position to identify let us call, this is S	dev
audio_0_22174.wav	2 plus lambda square So this value if I put I can find out the value of phi as like this 0	dev
audio_0_69933.wav	so this shows that if we have a problem like this	dev
audio_0_105329.wav	So, one terminal is ground, one terminal is connected to the V o one connected terminal is connected to the v o	dev
audio_0_20431.wav	Right, arranging himself at the study place, so this would be 2	dev
audio_0_81176.wav	If they are investing that money by not paying it to the supplier they are investing it elsewhere and they are earning more than the penal rate of interest then it is justified that okay	dev
audio_0_151731.wav	So, many factors you have to ah consider ah I mean you have to consider many things	dev
audio_0_137042.wav	Now, here in C++ all the only change that we have made is instead of having call by reference, call by value	dev
audio_0_210615.wav	AB we have to draw first, directrix is a vertical line name it, A somewhere B draw something axis CC prime, which is horizontal line	dev
audio_0_134558.wav	So, this is just to highlight through a simple example that the order of the data member can be critical and while writing the initialization list, you should be aware of the order in which the data members are actually created	dev
audio_0_127527.wav	And there is additional information which I already talked about	dev
audio_0_205778.wav	If that is the case can we draw projections of this point A	dev
audio_0_122966.wav	Multiplication is usually called the gain will see gain in the minute and then finally these carriers are then extracted out of the device in the form of a current	dev
audio_0_138758.wav	However, deeply it may be nested and just returns it to the environment	dev
audio_0_32963.wav	So it keeps decreasing and it reaches 1 then in the next step it will divide	dev
audio_0_166190.wav	Can we have a mathematical expression where we substitute values and then we get the result whether it is schedulable or not	dev
audio_0_36228.wav	Therefore, in this case the target is not reachable from the source node	dev
audio_0_206970.wav	Now, on this surface, we would like to have a inclined surface on which there will be additional thing	dev
audio_0_119925.wav	So, consider a piece of metal, one end of it is hot and the other end of it is cold	dev
audio_0_49282.wav	Yes, that has also changed now	dev
audio_0_72312.wav	so each of these grid terminals that we have, so the clock tree is driving these terminals, all of them, which means i have some kind of a parallel driver connection there can be, for example, in this case, five by five, there can be twenty five such drivers driving twenty five pins in this grids	dev
audio_0_169117.wav	And, the insights gained from experiments in that facility have made it possible to detect the individual pose of a group of people using a single camera and a laptop	dev
audio_0_214102.wav	Let us take a plane, is more like taking a knife passing through cone; we can cut the cone perhaps at that section	dev
audio_0_197981.wav	So, which means I am going to have this work as an inductor, whereas here, I am going to make this work as a capacitor which actually tells me that I will be able to control the power factor on the stator side of a synchronous motor by adjusting the DC excitation	dev
audio_0_175863.wav	We also discussed current and voltage division then we discussed voltage and current phase relationships for inductor and capacitor and then we studied the instantaneous and average power calculation	dev
audio_0_404.wav	So, this is your a just hold down this is a b and c right this is T network the star network R 1, R 2 and your R 3 all are given 10, 20 and 30 ohm right	dev
audio_0_190529.wav	I would say it is better to look at an AC current in this case because we are looking at the induced EMF, d lambda by dt and so on and so forth	dev
audio_0_158481.wav	75, now it has become 6 by 4, that is 1	dev
audio_0_204911.wav	Top view, from top, we have to look on to a plane which acts like mirror	dev
audio_0_172279.wav	For that we use the fundamental theorem of network	dev
audio_0_106976.wav	Another way is when you want to create the diffusion layer	dev
audio_0_161793.wav	So, if you see carefully you will realize that the opening balance of 1 2 00 is received on 18th April and a fresh sale, the amount of 250 is yet to be received till 1st May getting it perhaps they have a credit period of 1 month so last month's balance is received this month's balance is due it is carried to the next month creditors there was only one credit purchase on 2nd April for 3,000 the balance is still pending we have already paid the opening balance of 8 800 on 202nd of April so these are the accounts of receivables and payables	dev
audio_0_58157.wav	i can take common and this quantity sine phi minus x unit vector, plus cosine phi y unit vector, is nothing but phi vector, unit vector, because this is for r greater than or equal to r	dev
audio_0_108506.wav	If we have a diode, can we measure with both the multimeters	dev
audio_0_39436.wav	So, this term you are saying should be like this and	dev
audio_0_5671.wav	So, in this case if you make it like this by right hand, if you grab this way your what you call this winding by right hand, then thumb will be the direction of the flux path	dev
audio_0_78926.wav	So, if you look at all these variances in total the amount is very high, that is 144,000 of the variances but means we will have to check out the reasons for that and try to find out if the reasons were controllable and were not controlled then we will have to take action against the people or those reasons who have not performed their part but if largely the say the reasons were uncontrollable nobody can control it because of the external factors because these reasons have come up because of the external factors, then I think we have to ignore it and we have to leave it to the time and the market situation that how the market responds	dev
audio_0_177879.wav	Viscous friction we represent with B into dy by dt and then force which is responsible for mass to move in this direction	dev
audio_0_2558.wav	So, now another way to get this phase current is to apply KVL, for example, applying KVL around loop, so, aABbna right	dev
audio_0_124836.wav	The synthesis techniques were very limited, for example in a narrow band filter case, we could only change some gap, introduce a gap, put it in shunt or inÉ Or put a transmission line element in Cascade and something like this	dev
audio_0_41155.wav	Now let us do the same calculation in a slightly different way	dev
audio_0_44818.wav	So, what we will do is we will start with TE and derive something, and generalize I mean the together TM is actually even easier o, so will start with this one TE polarization	dev
audio_0_112833.wav	What does that mean that if I have a chamber and if I have 2 boats right	dev
audio_0_170765.wav	The connotations which we have from food are important in the studies of body language because it imparts us various associations with the anthropological, sociological and psychological makeup of individuals in any professional situations	dev
audio_0_160227.wav	It says for the period I think you all know that profit and loss account itself is prepared for a particular period, maybe a year or a quarter or for a month	dev
audio_0_106005.wav	Now the critical frequency of a high pass RC filter occurs when; what is the formula	dev
audio_0_130687.wav	Or am I an engineer first and an academic second	dev
audio_0_65990.wav	so this diagram actually shows that exactly	dev
audio_0_106184.wav	Iit is at high temperature, high enough to melt polysilicon	dev
audio_0_43794.wav	So, here is where there is a little bit of signal processing that we need to look at ok	dev
audio_0_71718.wav	but retiming we had use to earlier we talked about to improve the performance of a design	dev
audio_0_207268.wav	So, your entire capital A capital B line up a case one projected to a point on horizontal plane whereas, is projected onto a vertical plane as a line	dev
audio_0_71028.wav	for example, here you talk about logic, here and in structurally you talk about a loose and registers and here you talk about macros and floor plans	dev
audio_0_203733.wav	It's a property of the processing with which the transistor is made and we can't change that	dev
audio_0_216543.wav	A well known example is that when learners are doing experiments with circuits, if the experiment helps them connect to a situation in their home where for example, a bulb becomes very bright just before it burns out	dev
audio_0_41128.wav	The boundary around it; the boundary is the boundary between V 1 and V 2 and I have I have pushed the boundary little bit this way, but r prime is still there; r prime is not moving I am moving the boundary a little bit	dev
audio_0_197073.wav	Only these two are deciding what is the value of no load speed	dev
audio_0_196270.wav	So physically rotating poles creates a revolving magnetic field	dev
audio_0_12506.wav	When ac circuit will come at that time instead of R Thevenin, it will be z Thevenin that there we will see the impedance part right	dev
audio_0_59110.wav	so this is going to be point zero, five, which is square root of one thousand or five, two hundred or roughly fourteen meters per second, and therefore the wave	dev
audio_0_53989.wav	And you see this is exactly what we have been discussing	dev
audio_0_130430.wav	Now, we look into the hydration of Ye'elimite, right, because that is what is causing the expansion and that is what leads to the formation of Ettringite, monosulphate and other phases	dev
audio_0_106658.wav	So, when you take our integrated circuit, when you take an operational amplifier, what you see do you see that there are five terminals, five main terminals what you will be using, we say inverting terminal, we say non inverting terminal, we say positive supply, we say negative supply, we say output	dev
audio_0_147615.wav	In the LED part there will be some kind of a LED driving circuit	dev
audio_0_84867.wav	As I told you, salaries, water wells, electricity bills, they there we get the spontaneous credit of 30 days	dev
audio_0_147409.wav	This will be required only once at the beginning	dev
audio_0_175571.wav	So, this we get in the s domain next is how represent that equation in the circuit	dev
audio_0_177831.wav	What are those elements	dev
audio_0_152233.wav	But you are what you call your ah load this Q l is equal to 532 kilo hour right, Q c becomes your ah your what you call 726 it is more than your ah your what you call that will Q l, Q l is 532 or something right	dev
audio_0_97418.wav	Let's say you're somewhere there, 1	dev
audio_0_41595.wav	So, if I want to image you know head size, the head size is fixed for this head size the bandlimit is fixed	dev
audio_0_208883.wav	And when we are projecting these in the isometric; for example, this length we are going to project it at 30 degrees thing	dev
audio_0_37720.wav	So, they induce a competition right	dev
audio_0_195086.wav	So, I may be able to measure the output power or I may say that I want an output power of maybe 250 watts from this transformer	dev
audio_0_210511.wav	So, the typical electrical motors, there will be shaft and there will be rotor and so on; there will be a plate bearing kind of supported kind of plate which you go ahead and insert it and bolt in it, tighten it, such kind of machine element what we are trying to look at here	dev
audio_0_42154.wav	Actually the answer is no, we will leave it as it is	dev
audio_0_13169.wav	This means, this means this is your this is our , current ripple this I , this b is a 25 Volt 5	dev
audio_0_175819.wav	Suppose you are not following the Thevenin theorem and you want to analyze the circuit what you will do	dev
audio_0_39675.wav	There is depends	dev
audio_0_57882.wav	if i have a long cylinder with magnetic moment in z direction, uniform magnetic moment in z direction, then curl of m is zero	dev
audio_0_43369.wav	So, its last 30 years that it has been and since then that has been developed more and more in a sophisticated ways ok	dev
audio_0_204163.wav	Many times you just see the circuit thrown in but we need to understand exactly why we have every one of these components so that is why I took time deriving this whole thing	dev
audio_0_61167.wav	so you see that our amplitude are such that they also satisfy energy conservation	dev
audio_0_18442.wav	So are you saying we add that also into	dev
audio_0_193992.wav	If the reluctance is changing for some reason or the other maybe because of the movement of the rotor which is having protruding structure, you guys understand it is not a smooth structure	dev
audio_0_149798.wav	Say for example, if you are collecting demographic details and you ask someone how many family remembers do you have or if you ask somebody how children you have; the number would vary and this would be basically discrete variable	dev
audio_0_69904.wav	now, because the wire is five m m long, which means five thousand micrometer	dev
audio_0_97163.wav	It is how much of axial load is actually coming on to the joint	dev
audio_0_94669.wav	Now let's see why you should go for project planning	dev
audio_0_128252.wav	25 percentage of solids by mass of binder which actually translates to about 5 percent of super plasticizer by mass of cement, 5 percent I will show you how to add that also	dev

audio_0_206922.wav	The auxiliary front view p1' will also be at a height m above the X1Y1 line, because the point p we are projecting it onto auxiliary vertical plane	dev
audio_0_34123.wav	The most simple way to do this in python is to take what is called a slice	dev
audio_0_150862.wav	So, accordingly generation slowly and slowly will pick up the load	dev
audio_0_195378.wav	So corresponding primary side current will be 10 ampere if I look at the total current of the primary side I should have this 10 ampere added to the 0	dev
audio_0_125673.wav	That is beyond F max it no longer gives any usable gain	dev
audio_0_78903.wav	So, largely we have to avoid this variance but we means not avoid but we have to ignore this variance because this is something which has happened because of the factors which are out of control	dev
audio_0_63344.wav	whatever is coming input in the at the input will get stored and the last value, so after clock goes down, that will be the value that will get stored	dev
audio_0_112323.wav	So, black is ground or common right and you will see here, if I just take out this probes, you see here, what is written	dev
audio_0_75863.wav	So now finally you have to balance it and while balancing it, similarly the fixtures payments are not in the month of February	dev
audio_0_179758.wav	So, this justifies that the reciprocity theorem is applicable in this particular case	dev
audio_0_146798.wav	And we have given a small delay that is 10 milliseconds	dev
audio_0_84994.wav	Now, next part we'll be talking about is that for say preparing the profit and loss account and the operating budget and the final statement of the operating budget, that is the profit and loss account, we need to have the sales	dev
audio_0_78612.wav	Second is the investment center when we want to go for the say increasing the production capacity or adding the new product lines or maybe entering into the new markets new investment is required	dev

audio_0_150355.wav	In temperament again you have affiliative and pragamatic on one hand Affiliative have two components responding and initiating, and same which pragmatic you could be responding and initiating type, Abstract and concrete type	dev
audio_0_152843.wav	So, same as before first your ah V 3 you got this one, V 2 we got this one, V 3 is equal to this one, you substitute you will get this one right and V 4 also you just substitute I 3 and Z 3 right, because Z here is decrease it is 1	dev
audio_0_112498.wav	Output is about 1 volts peak to peak	dev
audio_0_68886.wav	so here these dotted line means i am starting with a vertical cut and in fact, this is the best vertical cut	dev
audio_0_45690.wav	So, the right hand side requires what electric field at	dev
audio_0_127332.wav	Welcome you to this course and we are waiting for your lecture	dev
audio_0_141593.wav	The reason I perceive that I will rather have a member function to start with because it is possible that when I set this last dial number I may want to keep some more properties along with the just the last dial number, for example, I might want to also remember as to when did I dial this person the last time	dev
audio_0_111743.wav	This is the, i If you know this many items or this manyall these equipments, it is enough for you to run lot of experiments to test lot of circuits, all right	dev
audio_0_111398.wav	Conductor will conduct electricity very well	dev
audio_0_118424.wav	To calculate the hole concentration we can use the law of mass action	dev

audio_0_16134.wav	3 ohm right	dev
audio_0_40872.wav	This does not look like a system of equation so far right, do I have n equations in n variables	dev
audio_0_140920.wav	So, please familiarize yourself more with the standard library	dev
audio_0_138985.wav	So, but the question is if I just a shape can you draw it, it is not possible to draw in arbitrary shape	dev
audio_0_175177.wav	So, if you see this figure here F1s and F2s are the two subsystems, the transfer functions of these two subsystems are F1s and F2s and these two systems are given the same input that is Xs	dev
audio_0_194303.wav	Let me look at it here if I actually look at what is, see we are essentially looking at the oscillation of the current at three times the frequency	dev
audio_0_81442.wav	Master budget includes the total performance for the given period of time, operating budget, financial budget, cash budget, so that we call it as a master budget	dev
audio_0_11790.wav	So, if you do so; that means, if you redraw this circuit again if we redraw this circuit again, then this will be terminal 1 and this will be your 90 ohm and this will be your 10 ohm this is your common terminal and, this will be your 55 ohm and this will be your 5 ohm and this is terminal 2 right	dev
audio_0_78147.wav	So, that depends upon the marketing philosophy, marketing strategy of the forms	dev
audio_0_139613.wav	So, this part is common you have the data members here in terms of the structure definition we have the data members the same way in terms class definition	dev
audio_0_66600.wav	lets assume that the sizes of these destination gates are different and their total capacitances are like this: one point five femto farads, all one point zero and zero point five	dev
audio_0_47931.wav	Next is the field produced by the current induced on antenna B; so, limits of integration	dev
audio_0_124738.wav	So in summary I would like to mention that tapers are in commonly used in microwave engineering	dev
audio_0_33922.wav	If there is no next node right, if we have only a singleton then we just set the value to be none and we are done	dev
audio_0_61742.wav	so if i would plot this r versus sigma r where it says: is it carries sigma naught over r	dev
audio_0_177522.wav	Now you have the circuit as shown in the figure in which the capacitor is connected in parallel with the series combination of 8 ohm, and 8 ohm resistance, and j 10 ohm impedance	dev
audio_0_127050.wav	So this is the unilateral design case and as we shall see later when we discuss about gain circles that we the locus of a of of gamma S or gamma L which gives a constant value of this GS or GL will be circles so this is the equation that we just discussed GTU or unilateral gain and the locus of gamma S that gives a constant value of this GS is the circles similarly the locus of gamma L which gives the constant value of this GL will also be a circle	dev
audio_0_69419.wav	now of course there is some other property where it runs, so so here we are not wanting it now	dev
audio_0_33827.wav	We set up a temporary pointer to point to the current node that we are at and so long as the next is none we keep shifting temp to the next value	dev
audio_0_3489.wav	But, this is your T by 4 and in that case for symmetrical waveform because this side area and this side area is same	dev
audio_0_123982.wav	Now here this element is a diagonal element Z N dash N dash so what it means is that this particular diagonal element is 0, that is the real part of this particular diagonal element is 0 but then since N dash can be any value any one of those diagonal elements, we have to conclude that all diagonal elements have their real parts as 0	dev
audio_0_166229.wav	And then why do we need a operating system	dev
audio_0_116706.wav	So, in this particular directory we would actually have two source files, one is known as the driver	dev
audio_0_127895.wav	Only what happens within the concrete plant for example would be gate to gate, cement is coming in aggregates are coming in and you only worry about until when the concrete leaves	dev
audio_0_17603.wav	So your important material for preparation is basically Internet and… Internet, yeah	dev
audio_0_7849.wav	There the bar was showing in the diagram right, slightly larger than the rotor which are pushed into the slot	dev
audio_0_207747.wav	So, it is a hexagonal pyramid	dev
audio_0_124272.wav	Here HX is oriented only along the X direction and E is oriented only along the Y direction	dev
audio_0_102249.wav	So, in this segment, I've reported the expressions at the bottom, but the different steps, the different points of the PM interaction diagram	dev
audio_0_32490.wav	Finally, if I say t is s dot strip then both sides are gone and I will just get the word that I want	dev
audio_0_113058.wav	Now, comes another topic which is mask and we have already studied about it	dev
audio_0_151649.wav	So, it effect is there also for loss reduction, but here for this branch and this branch there is no effect is coming for the capacitor whether computing P 5 or P 6 there is no effect is coming	dev
audio_0_131196.wav	However the bond ability of the strand can be influenced during manufacturing processes, subsequent handling and storage conditions	dev
audio_0_69556.wav	so the path is not sensitizable and is false	dev
audio_0_3795.wav	So, this has to be removed and this has to be shorted	dev
audio_0_192625.wav	So wattmeter is here, this is the pressure coil, this is the current coil okay	dev
audio_0_63608.wav	but in the mid nineties the interconnection delays, well, they started to go up because the wires become thinner and also the gates become smaller, they become faster	dev
audio_0_74011.wav	Fix Fix cost I have just talked to you which is a period cost which remains fixed over a period of time	dev
audio_0_99729.wav	I need to estimate the seismic weight to be able to calculate the base share coefficient	dev
audio_0_105300.wav	That whatever cut off frequencies is there right you have two cut off frequency; , one is cut off frequency f L, second is f H; one is f L, one is f H right	dev
audio_0_134548.wav	Now, the question is, what if between these two data members if you swap them, will this program scale what or will this program have some difficulties	dev
audio_0_126465.wav	Now matching, note, is different from conjugate matching	dev
audio_0_184363.wav	It is not very accurate	dev
audio_0_41383.wav	So, what is the practical way around this situation	dev
audio_0_19313.wav	So my question to you again is that how shall we move forward in that and what is stopping us from taking this product out there into the market, what are your primary challenges that you want to address out of our course here, so that we can show them that this is what we are going to do in design thinking	dev
audio_0_192642.wav	So, the first thing I need to do is unless I have the R2 dash value I cannot say how much is dissipated in among W naught, how much is dissipated in the backward revolving magnetic field circuit	dev
audio_0_101407.wav	It's easier to extract cores whatever said and done	dev
audio_0_148039.wav	And lastly the entire NPTEL team at the Center of Education Technology here at IIT Kharagpur and also at IIT Madras, who were actually running this whole show	dev

audio_0_50126.wav	We have studied different types of integral equations, this is a slight variation	dev
audio_0_179808.wav	So, there is no change in the Thevenin equivalent, Thevenin equivalent will remain same, the only change would be the load resistance that is now Rl plus delta R	dev
audio_0_133715.wav	They are indeed int here	dev
audio_0_147914.wav	So, in this process we need a Bluetooth module	dev
audio_0_131806.wav	So let us now think about what can be done to really control this, how can we actually specify the control of the concrete cover	dev
audio_0_70528.wav	and when the second vectors applied, we follow ah process, which is very similar to the deductive fault simulation	dev
audio_0_147724.wav	So, there will be some pulses coming like this	dev
audio_0_12523.wav	Now, next is that unit impulse function, right	dev
audio_0_115657.wav	So, the next video we will see that instead of just crashing the program we will force one particular payload of our choice to execute from this program	dev
audio_0_63202.wav	this is for the slack value and this is for the t n s value, so how much impact a change in net weight will be having on the corresponding slack value	dev
audio_0_212741.wav	When you are removing the frontal portion, that is the way sectional views works	dev

audio_0_84673.wav	Those changes are called as a setup changes	dev
audio_0_79320.wav	So, it means we have to see that what is the target	dev
audio_0_44799.wav	So, how will we do this is let us say that I have a xy plane is denoted over here, z is equal to 0 is an interface ok	dev
audio_0_64214.wav	so i am applying s one serially, applying i one parallelly and observing o one parallelly, observing n one serially	dev
audio_0_193049.wav	On the top I have to multiply it by A and at the bottom I have to multiply it by L	dev
audio_0_84000.wav	Now we have the contribution	dev

audio_0_138361.wav	This is an interesting code given here, I will not go through the details; try to understand how this code works how to manipulate with pointers	dev
audio_0_53067.wav	So the simulation works and you can see the various waveforms to understand the Buck converter circuit	dev
audio_0_133439.wav	6, if the user has said that then which particular function has the user intended to call	dev
audio_0_148460.wav	It is nothing, but log2 128	dev
audio_0_39475.wav	So, I know that the differential equation is this	dev
audio_0_18025.wav	Here also I would need a new folder, create right because again creating my own personalised content here, so I can have a different subject and content for that different subject being added right, okay so the next would be someone clicking on any of this particular icons right	dev
audio_0_174808.wav	So you can see that these two circuits that is Thevenin’s equivalent and Norton’s equivalent are dual of each other and the Thevenin voltage that is Vth can be given as ZN that is Norton’s impedance multiplied by the current that is Norton’s current	dev
audio_0_2575.wav	So, I AB upon I CA is equal to V ab you write and V ca is equal to you know V ab angle minus 240 degree you substitute	dev
audio_0_206492.wav	So, you will be in a position to draw a center line	dev
audio_0_50405.wav	So, the variable has to be held the same	dev
audio_0_107770.wav	We were that whenhen the capacitor gets charged, right the energy gets stored in forms of in the form of electro static energy	dev
audio_0_183636.wav	So, they are actually closed curves, but I am not drawing them as close, because I do not want to make it clumsy ok	dev
audio_0_176500.wav	But here the value of current is also minus of I2 because the direction of current is opposite	dev
audio_0_96991.wav	So, it's between that 1 and 1	dev
audio_0_78357.wav	Then in that case also part of the current assets can be brought down and rather than keeping 1	dev
audio_0_206578.wav	Then press Escape and Escape	dev
audio_0_114744.wav	For hardware and side channel attacks we will be studying various forms of this attacks are such as the cache timing attacks, a power analysis attack and a fault injection attacks, now side by side we will be also looking at the popular defence strategies prevent such attacks	dev

audio_0_210829.wav	Where we will have clear indication of lengths,that is the reason why we use this kind of projections	dev
audio_0_158805.wav	As I have told you earlier, these sheets are shared with you	dev
audio_0_204611.wav	Note that, we are showing these dimensions outside of the object outside not inside something like we are not mentioning it something like this is 5	dev
audio_0_36118.wav	Once again we can use python lists and it turns out that it is convenient to assume that a list it that represents a queue has its head at the right end rather than the rear at the left and the head at the right	dev
audio_0_212491.wav	Because we already know this true line now, project all these lines up in that way we project these lines	dev
audio_0_33387.wav	So, write takes an argument which is a string	dev
audio_0_174951.wav	So, this will be anyway become zero	dev
audio_0_158902.wav	In current year it is now 6,400	dev
audio_0_136354.wav	Then, once c has been constructed, it has to come here which mean that before the function can be called this actual parameters, C has to be copied to this formal parameter c param, and this process is the copy construction process	dev
audio_0_214604.wav	So, that helps the instructional team learn the cohorts, the groups of learners present within their e learning context	dev

audio_0_210872.wav	In the earlier classes, we have learned little bit about Solidworks	dev
audio_0_50409.wav	Let us this and what is the	dev
audio_0_19046.wav	So as design thinkers what we generally need are these two which is the covered syllabus and student retention to be very high, so this is my desired result	dev
audio_0_66993.wav	what where saying is that whatever bit to us shifted here, i am moving that bit to the seven chip	dev
audio_0_83482.wav	So, it is 12,500 plus 3,000 plus 3,000 minus 750 as depreciation	dev
audio_0_37384.wav	So, is there a possibility for a common man say like concept of right now we were talking about know group resources	dev
audio_0_155353.wav	00979 or rather oh it is 0	dev
audio_0_62706.wav	ok, so let us have a quick look at the so called performance driven physical design flow which is more or less standard practice in modern day vlsi circuits	dev
audio_0_152960.wav	So, manufacturer will give you say 5 megawatt capacitor right and they will say nominal voltage nominal voltage means suppose if it is written say 33 kv right it is a nominal voltage	dev
audio_0_205371.wav	Here you can see concentric mate	dev
audio_0_166398.wav	L can release the resource	dev

audio_0_207325.wav	It makes an angle phi here and this line if we are projecting, it makes another angle	dev
audio_0_36239.wav	And we get a value error we print out a message saying try again and we go back	dev
audio_0_163612.wav	First of all what is a ratio	dev
audio_0_55738.wav	So therefore I am calling this one as VG as we had indicated in the simulation and this is the signal to drive this on or off	dev
audio_0_205891.wav	In the case of ruled surfaces, it is not necessary that you will have equal number of points on both the sides, but usually for lofter surfaces you divide it equal number of points on both sides of this curve as and joined by straight lines	dev
audio_0_78141.wav	So, their market penetration policy says that you earn the same amount of profit	dev
audio_0_103515.wav	So, this is a typology that can throw up a problem, but is very prevalent in existing masonry constructions	dev
audio_0_190341.wav	So I am writing this like this	dev

audio_0_72089.wav	so what i do in this case is that i used some special standard cells, which are called feed though cells	dev
audio_0_10475.wav	So, this is two wire single phase system	dev
audio_0_179455.wav	So what we will do we will first take the mirror image so the mirror image of x one t will be like as shown in the figure, so now it will become x minus lambda you will take the lambda as an axis so now instead of having shape like this it has become the mirror image now the shape is like this	dev
audio_0_146610.wav	There is a plate whose area is A, there are two parallel plates, the separation is d, and there is a material in between called dielectric, which has a dielectric constant	dev
audio_0_124915.wav	Then as we know for bandpass implementation, we need a series resonator in series or a shunt resonator in shunt	dev
audio_0_213894.wav	So, this supposed to be focal point	dev
audio_0_38877.wav	So, this ALE can be connected to G; so, when this G is high then whatever is in the input, so that value is latched on to the 74373 latch	dev
audio_0_101132.wav	Now, that's true for public buildings and that's true for private buildings	dev
audio_0_56154.wav	i am not disturbed anything, i am not moved, charge around, any charges have not done anything and therefore the situation inside remains the same as earlier and therefore e becomes zero	dev
audio_0_113434.wav	If I talk about enhancement type MOSFET; let us see how the enhancement type MOSFET looks like	dev
audio_0_113491.wav	So, many bias potentials I am using I am not applying I am internally connecting the source and substrate all right or you can see that when you have I c, the source and substrates are internally connected to avoid too many bias potential	dev
audio_0_16955.wav	So, next is, next is circuit, I will show you the switch in the circuit shown in figure 46 has been in position A for a long time	dev
audio_0_35296.wav	So, you can go up a road or you can go right, but you cannot come down	dev
audio_0_137282.wav	Instead what you do, you invoke this particular static member function, what is static member function does, it initially checks, if this printer pointer is null or not null	dev
audio_0_34459.wav	So, one of them must be true, but it also possible when both are them true	dev
audio_0_51577.wav	So, this is the 1D problem; that means, the wave is going like this along the x direction right	dev
audio_0_209348.wav	So, if we are drawing something like that is the line this extension line, we will see it here	dev
audio_0_13724.wav	Ah First I am coming to that R R N is equal to 2 ohm right	dev

audio_0_146558.wav	The digital I/O port lines can be used as interrupt inputs as well; this is already discussed	dev
audio_0_50506.wav	Now if you look back at this equation over here, this is what I am discretising as pulses there is this term also over here which is going to appear everywhere	dev
audio_0_108780.wav	So, that is the beauty of stimulation, that you can play with the voltage othe at rthe input and immediately you can see the changinge in the output	dev
audio_0_14723.wav	I will give you the correct answer, but put everything in the forum	dev
audio_0_134787.wav	So, that will come out first, D has been added just before that, so it will come out next and in result we will get the string that we are showing here, which is E D C B A and we all are familiar with this	dev
audio_0_36128.wav	Imagine that we have a rectangular m cross n grid and we have a knight	dev
audio_0_100073.wav	We use a factor of safety to further bring down the design force and therefore the third component of response reduction that we are bringing in is due to the allowable stress, allowable stress approach and that is your RY that is sitting here	dev
audio_0_197138.wav	And just to make sure that the two pluses are not at different voltages normally they will be short circuited externally with thick copper conductor, so we will have thick copper conductors short circuited these two similarly, another thick copper conductor short circuiting these two like this, I am sorry I have just drawn in a very congested fashion	dev
audio_0_92029.wav	And therefore we assume that for an activity duration, the resource is constant	dev
audio_0_23636.wav	4 kilonewton So bearing strength we can find out 116	dev
audio_0_83062.wav	So if you take that into account at selling and distribution overheads	dev
audio_0_60063.wav	The force is going to be given by this vector	dev
audio_0_69453.wav	so in this case, for example, you can ignore the four hundred length path and you can only consider the other paths	dev
audio_0_199398.wav	So from these two you can see that VX has to be greater than minus VT	dev
audio_0_171232.wav	Signal and decode information to accurately communicate a message	dev
audio_0_60498.wav	so i am going to take it like this: this is x, y, x plus delta, x, y, x plus delta, x, y plus delta y, x, y plus delta y, and let us calculate this integral over this entire path	dev
audio_0_176455.wav	Now in case of h parameters we stabilize the relationship between V1 and I2	dev
audio_0_131203.wav	Once the stress is transferred specimen will be cut at the end and allowed to cure for 28 days, then you will take the specimen for bond testing	dev
audio_0_34758.wav	Do we need a list of common factors at all	dev
audio_0_39971.wav	So, maybe in the displacement like D one direction of that	dev
audio_0_207177.wav	We will go to insert components for linear coupler; I am loading	dev
audio_0_193164.wav	So this is the variables voltage starting, right	dev
audio_0_12707.wav	So, at your for t less than 0 this switch was opened and at t at that at your what you call; at t greater than 0 the switch is closed right 0 minus of 0 plus just before switching it is 0 minus and just after switching it is 0 plus right	dev
audio_0_10778.wav	Now; that means, we calculate P we , your what you call P plus jQ is equal to now voltage is equal to you have this is horizontal component plus vertical component V plus jV dash into I plus j I dash look at that phasor diagram because, you have 2 component one is real component, one is real component and another is your ah your what you call complex your this thing; however, it, but horizontal one is vertical	dev
audio_0_209972.wav	Similarly, this block is that and this one is that and right side view if you are looking at it, from right side dimensions we will try to look at	dev
audio_0_102263.wav	In this case, three bars may reach FSASI, whereas one bar is less than FSAASI	dev
audio_0_210455.wav	And there are other varieties like minimum spacing of base characters, and also minimum spacing between words are also mentioned	dev
audio_0_120163.wav	Mostly intrinsic semiconductors are used as optical sensors, in the case of photo luminescence experiments or as sensors for x rays in electron microscopes	dev
audio_0_178852.wav	25 Siemens, so you can say that this particular circuit is not reciprocal	dev
audio_0_195758.wav	In this case I am going to have actually Va frozen at rated value, it is not good to increase Va beyond rated value because the insulation are designed for a particular value of voltage	dev
audio_0_179833.wav	So, in the next week, we will start with some new topic on the course that is our basic electrical circuit	dev
audio_0_198783.wav	So, now that we have kind of completed the armature reaction and its effect in the case of a separately excited DC generator	dev
audio_0_507.wav	Now, this means that the gross mechanical power output in these 3 times that is 3 phase actually the electrical power absorbed in the resistance, r 2 dash into 1 upon S minus 1	dev

audio_0_127130.wav	Will discuss a few of the common ways to do this	dev
audio_0_168205.wav	And it is this aspect of cultural associations which we will discuss in detail	dev
audio_0_196824.wav	(Professor – student conversation starts) Is armature resistance control commonly used	dev
audio_0_76319.wav	So, the actual time if you look at here is that is the how many 200 hours the gang has worked	dev
audio_0_160432.wav	It is something to do with the concept of accounting period	dev
audio_0_45297.wav	Because, this is an exponential and it is divided by root rho right; so, this is going to be much more computationally efficient without any real loss in accuracy	dev
audio_0_85692.wav	In the actual what has happened, the input quantity has increased but the price per unit has decreased but still the variance ultimately is negative that is 2,000 600 rupees	dev
audio_0_216372.wav	So, if you have learners of that kind or if you have learners who have never experienced e learning, they may be daunted or they may be unfamiliar with the medium	dev
audio_0_75992.wav	These are not for months	dev
audio_0_85540.wav	What kind of the variance analysis we did till now and what kind of the variance analysis we are going to do now	dev
audio_0_176077.wav	But suppose if the current source exist between two meshes where the both of the meshes are sharing the current source then what you have to do	dev
audio_0_126439.wav	If we have a source connected, then you might tell me that source itself is a reference	dev
audio_0_164636.wav	So, purchase of land, sale of land, purchase of machinery, sale of machinery, these are all investing activities or related to investments like keeping FD or withdrawing FD with bank, purchasing some shares or selling some shares, all this is included as investing activities	dev
audio_0_52202.wav	It is a very popular way of modeling a current source that is the reason we are doing it ok	dev
audio_0_36822.wav	Because both the places are making similar kind of demand	dev
audio_0_178918.wav	Suppose there is A, B, C phase sequence star connected source with the phase voltage Van equal to 100 angle 10 degree and it is connected to a delta connected balanced load with impedance 8 plus J 4 Ohm per phase	dev
audio_0_118979.wav	In this particular question, this also depends on T to the 3 over 2	dev
audio_0_171838.wav	Now, if you see this particular equation you will come to know there are 2 important components in the equation	dev
audio_0_127954.wav	So rice husk is what remains after we extract it what we can eat the rice from the paddy and that means that we have to burn it to get ash, calcination control burning is done obviously this is going to give up some CO2 and then we get ash	dev
audio_0_174854.wav	So, independent source in this case is the current source	dev
audio_0_217213.wav	of course there are switching losses if you go auto higher frequencies, but then thats why the design really comes into picture	dev
audio_0_162147.wav	Now, all expenses of the concern in that particular year or that for that period are listed out	dev
audio_0_49074.wav	What we have seen so far is when we started with the mathematical formulation of method of moments, the first example we took was the surface integral formulation	dev

audio_0_124629.wav	And then I mentioned how to how to adjust or how to arrange stages in cascades so that you get the lowest noise figure overall	dev
audio_0_45756.wav	So, I take this guy take this guy and substitute them here right and what will that give me, it will give me some update equation right	dev
audio_0_2012.wav	Since the rotor mmf F 2 0because rotor is open circuited so no current is showing	dev
audio_0_7282.wav	So, in this case that figure 55 shows R L circuit and may be replaced by the circuit shown in figure 56	dev
audio_0_47428.wav	So, now let us play the final card of tricks which is step 5, is that if the N points are chosen to be the roots of p N x ok	dev
audio_0_808.wav	So, up to your first 180 degree the voltage will be like this	dev
audio_0_80123.wav	We will have to find out the difference	dev
audio_0_142270.wav	Now when you follow the convention application route or the PCT route, you file a priority document	dev
audio_0_18315.wav	Sorry, you have something to… There are two ways you can go about	dev
audio_0_40601.wav	So, if this water flowing across in the interface, how much comes from the left that much goes into the right	dev
audio_0_146132.wav	You see when I am saying move register to register, I need to specify only two operands	dev
audio_0_44832.wav	Because, I mean in general that will not be true, but here it is true because	dev
audio_0_180597.wav	So, therefore, it is called inverting amplifier, because this sign of the output is inverted, this is called inverting amplifier, because of this minus sign	dev
audio_0_143238.wav	So, the PARIS convention did not set any minimum standard for patents	dev
audio_0_175615.wav	Now, another advantage is that this will give you a complete response which will include transient and steady state response of the circuit	dev
audio_0_209927.wav	And, what we have to locate is 75 mm locate that point this is our true length	dev
audio_0_107062.wav	05 to 0	dev
audio_0_168261.wav	Business culture: Here a case in high context cultures, this is lesser in low context cultures	dev
audio_0_150421.wav	And therefore it is very difficult for me to find out the complexes that the individual has, and which is a source of discomfort, a source of pathology for this very individual	dev
audio_0_61751.wav	now what the problem wants to know is the if a point charge q is placed on the axis of the ring at height z	dev
audio_0_40052.wav	Yes, the error is an order delta z squared in a centered difference, what I have written over here is called a one sided difference ok	dev
audio_0_136205.wav	There is a function which takes a call, takes a parameter by reference and returns that same parameter by reference	dev
audio_0_47702.wav	So, they have shown it over here	dev
audio_0_197864.wav	So the construction is not easy when if it has to be in the rotor	dev
audio_0_212152.wav	So, FO again equal to this new point F prime where another focus one can really locate it	dev
audio_0_124110.wav	So, we need YC of 0	dev
audio_0_109651.wav	So, this is like a potential divider	dev
audio_0_175994.wav	And then we discussed the example which was essentially a DC circuit	dev
audio_0_147718.wav	Now, the point is that for interrupt what really happens	dev
audio_0_214753.wav	You may pause the video here to answer this reflection spot	dev

audio_0_48053.wav	Write it like this H incident plus H scattered and since my variable is H total, I should not introduce a new H s over here I will just confusing things	dev
audio_0_111108.wav	So, it is very easy to understand	dev
audio_0_45109.wav	Now, let us go back and see what is the kind of term that we have to worry about right	dev
audio_0_71130.wav	now you will see, this is still not a complete description because we have not a defines sum and carry	dev
audio_0_111747.wav	He is connecting the probe right to the channel one, this is channel one, right	dev
audio_0_115062.wav	Now over here we is the part where we actually look into the EPCM check the various permissions and so on and ensure that this particular EPC where is going to be accessed has indeed the right permissions to permit that particular access	dev
audio_0_62166.wav	if i put a small stick and if it tends to turn, then curl is non zero	dev
audio_0_72108.wav	you can place a block in one of the rows, but you, if you do not have any such restriction, then you can place the block anywhere on the chip on any coordinate	dev
audio_0_12025.wav	Now, switch this on at t is equal to t 0, therefore initial values will be v, it is v t 0 minus v infinity will be there as it is, it is there as it is, then e to the power minus then t minus t 0 divided by tau	dev
audio_0_93457.wav	When the product size increases two times, please mark here the development time does not double it	dev
audio_0_72188.wav	so whatever strategy i use to carry this clock signal up to this say i can use some connections like this	dev
audio_0_128920.wav	So in such cases, for pre stressed concrete, do you have, do you think that cathodic protection will be a good thing to do, especially for new structures so that we can ensure that they do not corrode	dev
audio_0_116564.wav	So, for example, if the multiplexers select line is 0 then this input at the multiplexers is sent to the output	dev
audio_0_58367.wav	so we all ready solve problem eight, where we found that the charges plus on this side you find that chudai charges class on the siren on the side cosine khiladi discharge in august and minus on his side, cosine theta dependence	dev
audio_0_101294.wav	What you are seeing here is a wall cross section coming from a historical structure	dev
audio_0_110978.wav	R 1 equals to 10 kilo ohms;	dev
audio_0_167539.wav	And that conclusively shows that rate monotonic scheduling is stable under transient overload because whenever a higher priority task arrives even when a lower priority task has not completed that will be context switched and the higher priority task will run so the lower priority task must yield the CPU to the highest priority task to the higher priority task will run	dev
audio_0_117560.wav	Then done is that EADD completed implemented in the processor will then record EPCM information in a crypto log that is stored in the SECS	dev

audio_0_111105.wav	If I connectvert itthi sto a if I convert this unity gain amplifier to a non inverting amplifier	dev
audio_0_47185.wav	It is not minimum right	dev
audio_0_7631.wav	So, this is the iron loss and this is copper loss this is the answer	dev
audio_0_125794.wav	Now, you might ask me what is the application of a coupler because if a coupler is just providing power division between the coupled and through ports, then it looks very similar to a power divider	dev
audio_0_176874.wav	So that is why whatever the theorems we will cover in this particular module will not be applicable to power because the relationship between input and output is not linear	dev
audio_0_210395.wav	Most sophisticated drafters are also there, and those are shown here	dev
audio_0_169432.wav	For example, while we are travelling in a crowded train or a bus or we are within a crowded elevator some touch cannot be avoided	dev

audio_0_54737.wav	One is the diode, rectifier diode, and the other one is the capacitor	dev
audio_0_82183.wav	But sometimes what happens that normally we follow the absorption costing system because marginal costing is not the alternative to the total costing system	dev
audio_0_14492.wav	So, there are three paths right and say both we say either of this what coil is excited by 1 ampere current first we consider only i 1 is equal to 1 ampere forget about this one, the turns here it is 500 and turns here it is your 1000 turns	dev
audio_0_201134.wav	That is why we are able to couple the input through a capacitor, take the output through a capacitor and so on	dev

audio_0_56273.wav	that curl is in the negative z direction	dev
audio_0_1595.wav	So, here it is your reference line	dev
audio_0_215924.wav	Consider the following example in which a teacher is describing the function of a heart and its different parts	dev
audio_0_34601.wav	As saw the value of y actually did not change and the question is why it should change	dev
audio_0_129044.wav	And try and design accordingly	dev
audio_0_195480.wav	So even I am talking about as the available EMF across the winding, which will be actually inducing a secondary EMF	dev
audio_0_44872.wav	Yeah, because z equal to 0 is the tangent to the surface	dev
audio_0_113580.wav	And VDS is less than VGS minus V T	dev
audio_0_118787.wav	The first one we want to find is the concentration of electrons or holes, because this is a pure semiconductor	dev

audio_0_10723.wav	This is your a reactive or wattless component of the current right	dev
audio_0_32076.wav	We could say, define apply list, which takes the function f and the list l, and for every x and l, you just replace this x by f of x; and since l, list is a mutable item, this will update list in the calling function as well	dev
audio_0_46809.wav	So, let us proceed	dev
audio_0_103685.wav	It could be 3	dev
audio_0_108397.wav	Another thing is that, at the same time we can use 2 voltage sources, you see 2 voltages different voltage	dev

audio_0_75499.wav	1700 is the 85% of some value and what could be that value you can easily find out that that value is 2000 that value is going to be 2000 because 2000 and into how much is the waste is 15% divided by 100 so this works out as how much this is 15% so	test
audio_0_133595.wav	That is what we have shown at this point	test
audio_0_71784.wav	so that was our assumption	test
audio_0_103253.wav	So, let's keep that in mind and use this as a basis for the formulations	test
audio_0_71297.wav	i am assuming that there is an h between every pair of vertices, so every connection is possible	test
audio_0_33081.wav	There is no specific order that you can get from this	test
audio_0_40752.wav	So, its value is let us say 1 over here and at x 2 e	test
audio_0_75351.wav	So, if you calculate this, so for this calculating the rate, standard rate, we will have to do some adjustments, some updations or some upscaling of the standards	test
audio_0_195115.wav	One particular point I had forgotten which I have to mention in the next class as to why the wattmeter reading in no load test represents only iron losses, why the wattmeter reading in the short circuit test represents only I square R losses or copper losses, why not the other way around, okay	test
audio_0_162953.wav	So, far we have covered detailed discussion on financial statements, balance sheet, P&L as well as cash flow	test
audio_0_102018.wav	Therefore, what becomes important if you are actually going to make rigorous calculations on capacities which the code does not require but if you were to design something which is not a simple confined masonry construction you will have to make calculations, you may have to make ultimate capacity checks and any model that you look into must have the interaction effects of the unreinforced masonry wall panel with the confining elements and there is a body of literature particularly coming from Eastern Europe works by Tomazevich and Group in Zagreb and also from South America on analytical approaches for understanding the lateral load behavior, strength and deformation capacity of confined masonry constructions is available and you can we are also looking at a couple of such works to understand the in plane flexual capacity and the in plane shear strength of confined masonry constructions	test

audio_0_131190.wav	Now let us see the significance and use of this test method	test
audio_0_178616.wav	That means that there is no time factor coming in this particular expression	test
audio_0_36411.wav	Then finally, we look at 14 and find that 14 does not appears so we skip it	test
audio_0_17353.wav	Because it is a copyright issue, so mostly we do not get it but… Yes mostly we do not get it	test
audio_0_162525.wav	What other items	test
audio_0_39466.wav	So, for a dc problem what is the you know you have a charge and you want to find out voltage that is your dc problem	test
audio_0_38069.wav	Now, I was going to play a specific sports because of my keen interest in that, I was not interested whether I would become a great player or anything like that, but then the object of my joy is now converted into a mechanism	test

audio_0_183160.wav	Now, V o is already negative ok; so this is minus V supply	test
audio_0_178116.wav	So you can take it out	test
audio_0_127172.wav	Now one way we can do that is again you know you take a compass with the origin of the gamma plane as the center and draw an arc till you are crossing the R equal to 1 circle	test
audio_0_13598.wav	So, if in the case of voltage source, we have to sort it; if you do so, now what will happen now as soon as suppose this current is ah suppose this current say I 0 this current is I 0 right	test
audio_0_182529.wav	So, this will go up this is going down this is going up	test
audio_0_139915.wav	As we go from mobile to smart phone we find yet some more functionalities coming in and in that way the phones form a very nice small specialization generalization hierarchy	test
audio_0_61494.wav	f at x is equal to zero, to the function of time t here	test

audio_0_83206.wav	That is the purpose of the budgeting	test
audio_0_215518.wav	One principle which is very important is the affordance principle which tells you what is to be clicked and when	test
audio_0_42485.wav	So, the grid is let me use a different color the grade is this, this is still the grid I am considering	test
audio_0_62749.wav	ok, now here when you do routing, you may also land up in something called a wiring congestions	test
audio_0_46758.wav	So, this boundary condition will not be strictly true because there are more fields over here	test
audio_0_164833.wav	Do you remember what is interim dividend	test
audio_0_164694.wav	We raise money by way of shares	test
audio_0_193807.wav	That is what we are taking as the inductance	test
audio_0_126418.wav	Then if we now have a system where we can use this error, where we can you know remove this error, so to do that what we do is this output signal is now subtracted from its own version using a delay, so as to account for this delay of this amplifier	test
audio_0_103814.wav	So, this redistribution is something that is not going to be considered in your, in the expressions or the failure plane itself	test
audio_0_167638.wav	EDF, we saw that it is the optimal algorithm, there can be no other algorithm which can schedule a set of tasks if EDF cannot	test

audio_0_40952.wav	So, that was step 1	test
audio_0_185405.wav	So, we a denote the two inputs with plus and minus symbol and we call them as a inverting and non inverting inputs minus for inverting plus for non inverting inputs ok, you can also call for simplicity plus input minus input ok	test
audio_0_174842.wav	Now to find the Vth, what we will do will find the value of voltage across the terminal a b	test
audio_0_32457.wav	We insert into the tree all these values and now we are print t give me a sorted version of this	test
audio_0_39559.wav	No the U 2 two enough this two refers to left or right	test
audio_0_168857.wav	But in this group, we look at the two people are standing with certain closeness in comparison to the third person and the third person who is slightly isolated in comparison to others is also showing his isolation with the help of other body linguistic signs	test
audio_0_194869.wav	And this series resistance is known to me	test
audio_0_207573.wav	So, third part means let us use our protractor 30 degrees, again 60 degrees and 90 degrees	test
audio_0_111847.wav	And then we can write I do you want it on or you want it off	test
audio_0_5497.wav	8 right, then minus terminal encountering first, then minus V o c is equal to 0 hope I have not missed any term	test
audio_0_5727.wav	So that is why this circuit is drawn analogous to your say DC circuit say this is analogous to DC circuit so, your phi is equal to F m upon reluctance	test
audio_0_107136.wav	We can have heating coils and we can have the silicon rod to push the wafer further inside the furnace	test
audio_0_47485.wav	And, you can work through the math you will get an answer 4 in this case also	test
audio_0_102749.wav	So, that is p into l	test
audio_0_16515.wav	Therefore you you have to again series means it is like a your find equivalence in parallel, for same way for series one you have to make it for capacitor	test
audio_0_50350.wav	So, what is del	test
audio_0_125611.wav	One interesting application of the Smith chart is to read impedances and impedance transformation	test
audio_0_209453.wav	So, we do not see anything depth and this one follows that one	test

audio_0_16128.wav	So, this i this is this is actually i x and this is actually V by 50; that means, in this expression you put also 3 by 2 into V by 50, then we will get the solution for v	test
audio_0_9947.wav	So, next one you look	test
audio_0_169125.wav	It is interesting that this smart mass scale reading of body language uses the same metaphor design; uses the same metaphor the same design, which had been used in the 19th century	test
audio_0_137062.wav	You could just use reference	test
audio_0_213405.wav	So, you are the person, who is looking at the monitor and the object is slightly inclined with you	test
audio_0_116292.wav	c and just specify that s is equal to 60	test
audio_0_19898.wav	But unfortunately neither could Sir Humphry Davy solve this problem and neither could Mr	test

audio_0_177160.wav	Otherwise we will use minus n	test
audio_0_155344.wav	00979 per unit megawatt and if you take up to 7 decimal places a bracket I made it it is minus 0	test
audio_0_19735.wav	But, you can see that this is where our observations were going in	test
audio_0_68782.wav	ok, the last example that i take here is with respect to designing memory	test
audio_0_42063.wav	So, just to be even more explicit, this is what I made	test
audio_0_171315.wav	This shine and a sparkle allows the interviewer to think that what you are talking about is actually an aspect in which you are interested and at the same time you are revealing and information of which you are proud	test
audio_0_39582.wav	We are not going into the derivation of why this is required, but you can just take it as a statement of fact	test

audio_0_20249.wav	So, the plane is very, very fast when it lands	test
audio_0_151964.wav	So, delta P L upon this P L delta P L P R it will become per unit that is why this and this, but this will remain hertz frequency will be hertz right; that means, unit of D will be per unit megawatt per hertz	test
audio_0_204857.wav	All these things projected	test
audio_0_133676.wav	Now, somehow this means that if I do this and I must call that particular function appropriately which multiplies, post multiplies a square matrix with a column vector	test
audio_0_4723.wav	So, in this case it will be move starting from here	test
audio_0_216817.wav	so lets start by showing you some scripts on the producer side, ah, so, so lets take the first script which is on the producer side, and so let me move this	test
audio_0_177787.wav	So, what we will do in this module	test
audio_0_202397.wav	We connected a drain bias resistor RD and the current through this was id 0 whatever the operating point drain current of m1 is so the voltage across m1 is vdd minus id 0 times r d okay we have to make sure that this is more than vgs minus vg s minus v can use exactly the same technique here	test
audio_0_44491.wav	So, this is my k z for a matched medium	test
audio_0_101536.wav	So with this condition for our equilibrium we are neglecting the portion which is basically cracked and we are working on the partial section and in this partial section from the triangle the geometry of the triangle we get an expression of what is the compressed length of the wall in terms of the total width of the total thickness of the wall and the eccentricity of the load itself	test
audio_0_126169.wav	So, let us start with the magic tee	test
audio_0_214141.wav	So, based on the slice angle and location, we get different conic curves; that is a reason we call, from the cone	test
audio_0_36904.wav	You just survive through the inertia through many years, but for reasons; known unknown we still do not know the cause all with there are many theories	test
audio_0_101288.wav	So, it helps you establish what is the morphology of the cross section and then you can also look at the condition of the masonry, condition of the units and condition of the mortar	test
audio_0_126824.wav	So coming back to our curve here, if the group velocity is constant, then there will be no distortion or dispersion between frequencies	test
audio_0_173164.wav	Now, let us take one another example in this case the node voltage needs to be determine but here the source is one is independent current source and second is the dependent current source	test
audio_0_199407.wav	Let me consider an example where we censored the drain and feedback to the source	test
audio_0_6993.wav	Another thing is that an intermediate point v 2 also it has been asked you find out right	test
audio_0_132739.wav	So, when it had to do this conversion it has silently created another location, so p j actually	test
audio_0_32529.wav	Now, what we want to do is we want to extract this information	test
audio_0_68358.wav	it because if you run a wire like this, it can unnecessary stop the other wires from coming in this area	test
audio_0_130359.wav	So that also competes for your Gypsum	test
audio_0_185426.wav	So, on this side right side we have V P minus V N greater than 0 and on this side we have V P minus V N less than 0 this implies V P is greater than V N and, this implies V N greater than V P	test
audio_0_133964.wav	So, what it does it simply implicitly converts the enum to int and adds by the operator of int	test
audio_0_14401.wav	So, now as we have seen earlier the direction of current flow is conventionally taken as the direction of positive charge movement I told you, that current when you take the battery symbol plus minus form the plus the positive charge is flowing	test
audio_0_13512.wav	And by ohms' law, by ohms law this current is a your clock clock wise we are taking this current actually i 1, it is entering into the positive terminal	test
audio_0_13374.wav	So, you when you moving it , look I moving clock wise direct clock wise	test
audio_0_147395.wav	It should be able to control the washing machine in a proper way, so that as a user you would be happy with the performance	test
audio_0_155541.wav	So, it is coming see 646	test
audio_0_139305.wav	So, we know that if in the same expression there is multiplication as well as addition; multiplication has to be done earlier wherever it occurs in the expression	test
audio_0_32531.wav	So what we need to do is look for this text between the strings, so we want to split the column into lines into chunks between the commas and this is done using the split command	test
audio_0_72074.wav	so when you want to connect them, you run a part on one layer, a part on other layer, so that this another connection that is going side by side does not intersect	test
audio_0_143066.wav	Before a person files for a design, the person can do a design search	test
audio_0_17815.wav	Understanding	test
audio_0_40576.wav	Similarly in this the edge is common to both elements	test
audio_0_150438.wav	Now, you have certain degree of authority invested in you, you are part of a law and enforcement agency which has invested great deal of authority; you can stop anybody, you can check anybody, you can examine somebody, you can take somebody in to custody, you can file case again somebody	test
audio_0_38773.wav	So, this latch becomes 1; so this Q bar becomes 0, as a result this transistor is turned off	test
audio_0_175214.wav	Now each signal here is the sum of signals flowing into it	test
audio_0_71864.wav	so now let us see, ah these latches, how they can be implemented using mos technology, because in v l s i chips we normally do not implement flip flops like this using nand gates	test
audio_0_115217.wav	In practice having a GOT table just like how we have done with data is quite time consuming	test
audio_0_104346.wav	So we will come to this aspect	test
audio_0_202740.wav	In our numerical example it was 3 volts and this appears across the gate and source of the MOS transistor	test
audio_0_65108.wav	so we are not unnecessarily allowing the input of the other block to toggle, because this will be use useless transition	test
audio_0_48316.wav	So, we will choose the centre point axis so, what becomes like this again exaggerated drawing ok, so this is my observation point ok	test
audio_0_171068.wav	In our next module we would look at kinesics as an independent part of nonverbal aspects of communication	test
audio_0_113043.wav	If this is the mask here which is shown for the positive photoresist we will retain the same pattern	test
audio_0_172584.wav	9689 legging	test
audio_0_194139.wav	So, what is given as the voltages is 400 is the line voltage in Star	test
audio_0_61001.wav	i also know from gauss's law, which is true even in this dynamic situation, rho over epsilon zero, that e is going to be equal to sigma over epsilon zero between the plates and therefore d e d t is uniform	test
audio_0_177111.wav	Here I2 by I1 is also N1 by N2 because the 1 is going inside the dotted terminal other is coming out from the dotted terminal	test
audio_0_15882.wav	If the power has a plus sign this is this is interesting this you have to understand; if the power has a plus sign power is been delivered to or absorbed by the element	test
audio_0_137449.wav	So, whether I have manual, whether I have electric, whether I have petrol fluid and so on, instead of deriving this object jointly from two hierarchies I will derive it on one here on this particularly wheel side and then refer to the engine hierarchy as a member, as a composition	test
audio_0_57380.wav	so we can write: b is also equal to zero	test
audio_0_54451.wav	So let me just run QSIM	test
audio_0_191079.wav	So obviously, the current will be kind of interrupted and it will be forced to confine itself to only one particular stamping, I may call this as lamination or stamping	test
audio_0_85484.wav	Similarly you talk about any in the services sector have become very very strong now	test
audio_0_207098.wav	So, the next mate available over here is width mate	test
audio_0_200374.wav	And in this case, the drain is common to input and output	test
audio_0_42212.wav	Complex permittivity is one thing, but when I do complex permittivity the implicit assumption there is that I am going to I expand the fields as in the e to the j omega t form	test
audio_0_150482.wav	So, once once you make this one and this right hand side actually we have made it to the what you call left hand side because will move from your what you call that your governor then your ah there is steam valve or governor then will move to the turbine then will move to the regenerator part right	test
audio_0_111625.wav	Now if I want to convert this sine wave, or if I want to apply a square wave instead of sine wave, then what is there	test
audio_0_63075.wav	so what does this global routing problem or algorithm generates as output	test
audio_0_179120.wav	Now, similar to the spring, linear spring which we saw in case of translational motion, we can also define torsional spring	test
audio_0_58560.wav	it is bent into a ring so that it becomes a torrid which is kept at center, at the origin	test
audio_0_184943.wav	And, we have to wait before we can take the reading	test
audio_0_45440.wav	So, this is just one choice ok	test
audio_0_85864.wav	That should not change	test
audio_0_61029.wav	in this case, we have already calculated b	test
audio_0_121349.wav	If the width of the active region is comparable to de Broglie wavelength, in that particular case we can get quantum confinement within the active region	test
audio_0_79170.wav	So we will see that in the previous year we had the four quarters and in the four quarters over the different quarter first to fourth	test
audio_0_202419.wav	So this circuit is the common source amplifier using current mirror bias	test
audio_0_144555.wav	So, or if your search is particularly to enter a particular jurisdiction; say, a foreign filing then you would stipulate that you need to understand what is the patenting on this invention in a particular jurisdiction	test
audio_0_141347.wav	Then we say that we have an array of base pointers, so staff is a array of base pointers which is engineer and we put all these pointers there in the same order that we have done earlier	test
audio_0_112996.wav	Hard bake is done at 120 degrees and for 1 minute	test
audio_0_119612.wav	So, this depends upon the material of the solar cell and also the kind of the dopants the concentration of the dopants, the width of the depletion regions and so on	test
audio_0_215294.wav	Because if sometimes while creating your files, version issues happened that is your earlier versions have been improvised, and that is why you have a latest version	test
audio_0_176961.wav	So we see there are 3 loops now for each loop if we apply the kirchhoff's law then for i1 the current would be 4 ampere which is straight away you can see from the figure	test
audio_0_85224.wav	Only in the third category we could save some money where we paid actually the lesser rate as against the standard but as a net result because of increasing the number of weeks, because of changing the labor composition and because of paying the higher rate in the first two category of the workers your total labor cost variance has become negative or your labor cost has increased by a whopping sum of 13,000 rupees	test
audio_0_194695.wav	So that is why what I will do is to have several number of conductors connected together	test
audio_0_174272.wav	Now, it is convenient to define a set of state variable and set equations to model the dynamic system	test
audio_0_11915.wav	So, what you can what you can do this right	test
audio_0_120689.wav	The actual resistivity or the conductivity depends upon the impurity level and also the crystalline state whether you have a single crystal or a poly crystal	test
audio_0_215901.wav	We can also include short assessment questions, formative assessment questions in between the chunks where a learner can click a multiple choice question just like you did at the beginning of this learning dialogue	test
audio_0_72149.wav	so you see, ah, when you design some chips which we except to cell in millions, for example the processor chips which intel manufactures, the pentiums, the multicore chips, cpu chips they are, they can effort to spend lot more time and effort in order to create a chip which is much better, much faster, much optimize	test
audio_0_178123.wav	So if you see the particular condition in the a complex plane so sigma is varying in the at the x axis and g omega at the y axis	test
audio_0_133474.wav	So, if I have to call function F3, then what is to happen	test
audio_0_71346.wav	so for a general simo circuit, so any on transistoric and model as a resistance and some pull up and pull down network, any such things, you can model as ah r, c, r, c, r c kind of a ladder and there you can make a quite accurate estimate of the dealing	test
audio_0_137114.wav	So, whenever a class is instantiated in terms of an object, the object will have the data members, and those data members we know can be accessed from the pointer of the object or from within the member functions of the object	test
audio_0_72541.wav	so if suppose i apply zero, zero, so in presence of the fault coming is, lets say first, in the absence of the fault, the output will be vdd or high, because both the transistors will conducting and both the pulled down or off	test
audio_0_70667.wav	so what do we total length	test
audio_0_43339.wav	So, we will just work through this	test
audio_0_103060.wav	We plug in delta sigma y into this expression from here and you get the final expression which is sigma A or B is the A of B is the average compressive stress under the action of both gravity forces and lateral forces as being the original pre compression in the wall sigma y plus or minus the shear stress into two times the geometry components delta x by delta y of the unit itself	test
audio_0_121041.wav	You can substitute these values in this expression	test
audio_0_139926.wav	I would first like to outline that when you talk about semantics of inheritance in C++, these are the first level items that you need to be very careful about	test
audio_0_123816.wav	So short circuited line will have this kind of an input impedance	test
audio_0_129858.wav	Now the picture here I showed in most concrete structure what you see is if this is a pile you know coming out of water body you can see that the more corrosion is happening right where the pile comes out of the water body	test
audio_0_47.wav	So, that is why cross sectional area of flux we call it is a flux path at radius r, it will be 2 pi r l upon P; 2 pi r l is that your so we are assume this is cylindrical	test
audio_0_106700.wav	So, now let us see	test
audio_0_66730.wav	so there are implications	test
audio_0_51776.wav	If I know the tangential field on a close control they act like	test
audio_0_41838.wav	As an antenna designer if you are given these parameters right you do not know CEM you have given the results of CEM looking at this what will you say	test
audio_0_179332.wav	Power is nothing but time rate of expanding or absorbing the energy	test
audio_0_203806.wav	Again it has to be remembered that this needs to be true only around a certain operating point	test
audio_0_169667.wav	It is common in sports people, it is also commonly visible in security forces and it is an impersonation of the toughness; the person wants to convey a mental toughness to the other person	test
audio_0_62360.wav	and this gives me chi m plus one m equals chi m b over mu zero, or m is equal to chi m over chi m plus one b over mu zero	test
audio_0_18918.wav	So why am I telling you this	test
audio_0_105144.wav	I have I can see here SiO 2 right you can see here SiO 2 see why because there is a window created	test
audio_0_155990.wav	So, therefore, the clearance between the conductor and the water level midway between the towers will be then 40 plus 14	test
audio_0_149899.wav	And therefore what happens the nature and the nurture they act together to shape us an individual the way we look in our real life to others	test
audio_0_44510.wav	So, this is the principle of PML the rest are all details	test
audio_0_98889.wav	So, it's very different if you consider the condition of rigid diaphragm and estimate the shear forces coming onto the individual walls versus the situation of diaphragm flexibility	test
audio_0_206340.wav	Let us do that these steps on a graphical sheet	test
audio_0_71036.wav	now this net list would translate in to physical domain where you do some kind of a chip level floor plant, like you decide that on your chip you can place your processor here, first memory here, second memory here, the i o, chips here	test
audio_0_190189.wav	One more generally that is done is we try to make, we never make the core broader and thicker, we try to make them thinner and longer like this, I am sorry for the bad drawing, okay	test
audio_0_15100.wav	37 ohm resistance have to be your what you call has to be in in inserted in that in that right	test
audio_0_105683.wav	You have applied here where are the bias voltage bias voltage is here, you see the red pin and black pin in the center in the center red pin, right in green pin, right	test
audio_0_166953.wav	Now let's look at the inheritance clause	test
audio_0_26606.wav	06 into 10 to the power 6 Newton millimetre	test
audio_0_72948.wav	so we are saying that the blocks connected to each other are suppose to exert attractive forces, just like as if they are connected by springs	test
audio_0_41884.wav	So, you want what about Maxwell’s equations in free space, no current, no sources, nothing right	test
audio_0_140748.wav	But, you are not interested to specify how actually this funct function computes the result integer from the parameters x and y	test
audio_0_195712.wav	So, we are going to have 1400 rpm when we were working at, you know 220 volts, now I am reducing it to 200 volts, when I reduce the voltage to 200 volts, Va minus Eb divided by Ra is going to be the current	test
audio_0_47488.wav	And in this case N is 2 so, this is accurate to order 3 my given function over here is a cubic polynomial	test
audio_0_34234.wav	The question is what happens to z	test
audio_0_143884.wav	So, this was an initial way by which when a trader or a seller of a goods when he had to have some kind of control over his goods, he would put a mark on it, so that marks could identify the owner	test
audio_0_45315.wav	So remember, in this integral r is over the object either surface of volume and r prime is far away correct	test
audio_0_16174.wav	So, next is you are determine the current through 10 ohm resistor of the circuit shown in figure 49 using Thevenin’s theorem right	test
audio_0_48903.wav	So, let us say you are sitting over here right, so this let us call this a top view and this is your let say this is a window and let us say there is a door over here and your mobile tower is somewhere over here right which is sending out signals everywhere	test
audio_0_12460.wav	So, in this section, we will learn how to replace two terminal circuit containing resistances and sources by simply equivalent circuit that you have learned	test
audio_0_216115.wav	We often use images with labels to represent facts and concepts	test

audio_0_12585.wav	So, here similarly, that means, if t is t 0 is equal to 0 then it will be 0 minus to 0 plus integration f t d t f t delta t d t and that is f 0 because this one this one just I am making it	test
audio_0_105855.wav	So, we will also see lot of experiments as a part of this course	test
audio_0_4720.wav	So, if this way similarly for the other this mesh 3, you can apply mesh 3; also you can apply KVL	test
audio_0_13413.wav	If you do so it will be minus 8 plus 2 i, minus 3 i is equal to 0; that means, minus 8 minus i is equal to i is equal to minus 8 ampere	test
audio_0_42390.wav	The absorption is going to happen along this it is the exponential decay along the z direction yeah	test
audio_0_212351.wav	These are the points through which this rope length is a winding rope	test
audio_0_108926.wav	The sentence written is that, in the conduction region, the current rate of an depletion or of a depletion type MOSFET is slower than the current rate in enhancement type MOSFET, is this statement true or false that is a question	test
audio_0_118751.wav	So, these are just a few points about intrinsic semiconductor; we will be using them today during the course of the assignment	test
audio_0_84751.wav	When you talk about the operating budget, what you are talking about here is you have to prepare many sub budgets because master budget is basically a comprehensive document	test
audio_0_160785.wav	So, balance sheet is a statement which summarizes asset on one side and external and internal liabilities on the other side	test
audio_0_134756.wav	So, we will have to proceed from left to right and compute that in the result will turn out to be 3	test
audio_0_60803.wav	i anticipate by biosphere law that magnetic field around this is going to be the circular direction	test
audio_0_155914.wav	So, is exactly exact thing what you call whatever you design you may not get whatever you this thing, but you will have some kind of idea	test
audio_0_209437.wav	Similarly, if one is looking from this direction, this one always be opaque on the back side, but this one is transparent wall	test
audio_0_102979.wav	So, what you can actually see in this three dimensional figure is sigma 1 and sigma 2 as the 2 axis, the y axis and the x axis, sigma 1 in tension, sigma 2 in compression	test
audio_0_70809.wav	so plus will work on b and c, you get something	test
audio_0_128325.wav	74 that is theoretical maximum packing this you can manipulate and put in a few more sizes and get to a higher value	test
audio_0_162065.wav	Unfortunately, human assets are not permitted to be shown on the balance sheet	test
audio_0_106297.wav	Let me write down, micro electro mechanical systems based sensor	test
audio_0_193802.wav	Because we said that essentially the total you know total actually area will correspond to Lambda times i which will be actually the rectangle and then you are going to have the diagonal exactly intersecting you know the area into two Halves exact two halves because of which Wf and Wf dash will turn out to be one and the same in terms of the magnitude	test
audio_0_96152.wav	because if motor shrinks too much it's established a bond with the unit but if it shrinks too much you can have failure at the bond by the time the wall gains strength and hardens	test
audio_0_118813.wav	63 times 10 to the minus 18 meter cube, so that is a really small number	test
audio_0_180772.wav	Similarly, actually let me just go up bit back to the previous class	test
audio_0_49253.wav	In #b, H is going to be equal to	test
audio_0_59361.wav	so you see, i've given you two examples where we can calculate a directly from a current distribution, and now i can take its curl and get my answer for b	test
audio_0_147986.wav	And it will not send any message unless there is a change in the position of this device	test
audio_0_191861.wav	So I may have something like a rubber lining or whatever so that will essentially make sure that the two are insulated from each other	test
audio_0_203600.wav	Now how do we obtain this v0 minus irm	test
audio_0_185035.wav	So, therefore, this path gets disconnected for a brief moment and then the entire current should or must flow through the meter through the meter only and this current maybe is a of a higher value than the FSD current or the allowable current through the meter and then the meter may get damaged, because for a brief moment there is no parallel path ok	test
audio_0_14209.wav	Now, in the second case, we have to raise the speed to 750 rpm	test
audio_0_148359.wav	So, as we change the duty cycle the average value of voltage that gets applied to the relay and hence the bulb will vary in proportional to the duty cycle	test
audio_0_37697.wav	The other side of the story is the guilt which adults have by doing all this	test
audio_0_169663.wav	And finally, when two people are walking together and their steps are matched going right left, right left at the same time; they want to talk to each other and they are probably friends although that is not technically a rule, but they want to talk to each other	test
audio_0_13382.wav	So, that will show you later	test
audio_0_148326.wav	If you see the statement of this experiment, we will be interfacing the electric bulb, we have already seen how we shall be interfacing the circuit, and will be switching it on and off	test
audio_0_141325.wav	Let me just quickly take you through what the code could look like	test
audio_0_100732.wav	This quantity alpha is the distance from where the axle load is acting to the centroid of the steel, the tension steel itself normalized to the effective depth D, which is from the edge compression fiber to the centroid of the tension steel	test
audio_0_177848.wav	So what we do	test
audio_0_157806.wav	Now this shows two things, one the fact that we acquires certain know rules, certain guidelines from our environment, that is what is know, let me development theory	test
audio_0_78653.wav	So, this is the very say technical process and you can call it as the process which is causing the serious losses to the board	test
audio_0_211574.wav	And there is a tiny hole passing through that, that we can represent by this long dash dashed line; this is the way we get a sectional view of the object	test
audio_0_19772.wav	So, you can mark them out to begin with just a simple smiley and a sad face	test
audio_0_210296.wav	Once done we have this point 1, now join A 1 B to construct the triangle	test
audio_0_116218.wav	Okay, so now we would move from the Elf executable to processes, so we would see what happens when you do, when you run dot/a dot out on your shell we would see how the process gets created and we would see how the Elf executable gets transferred from the disk into your RAM	test
audio_0_38479.wav	So, at this point; in between this activation of pc low and this activation of this PSEN bar	test
audio_0_34273.wav	But the point is when reading definition of f g is not used it is only remembered that this statement which should be in a bracket, just to be consistent	test
audio_0_178368.wav	So in that way either you apply Mesh analysis or the Nodal analysis in both way you will get the Thevenin voltage same	test
audio_0_7300.wav	So, tau is equal to L by R, the time constant say this is equation 67 and a is a constant which you have to determine and we know that natural response is always a what you call decaying exponential	test
audio_0_195926.wav	So if I say that these are majority of the flux lines path, some of the flux lines can definitely go through this, like this	test
audio_0_190052.wav	No load and open circuit are synonymous with each other, they are synonymous with each other, okay	test
audio_0_68728.wav	s m level we can take some decisions like this when we can do clock gating, to stop the clock	test
audio_0_102640.wav	So, differentiation based on load started occurring	test
audio_0_7526.wav	Now, another 1 is that figure 26 shows the simple circuit under dc condition, determine i v C v L and the energy stored in the what you call in the capacitor	test
audio_0_137790.wav	And by the rule, since this is the order in which the construction happened, naturally the destruction will have to happen in the reverse order	test
audio_0_147803.wav	So, when you will be connecting the Bluetooth module connected with the STM board to your mobile phone Bluetooth device, these two will communicate with each other	test
audio_0_53827.wav	If one uses a low dropout regulator, V drop can be as low as point by holds and you will have a very less dissipation and drop out there and you will not lose out much on the size of the transformer code likewise for the other winding also likewise for this other winding, you can put a three terminal regulator and accordingly adjust the output required or output requirement of the regulator	test
audio_0_81690.wav	So if you see that only possibilities of the 15% opportunity cost, 30% opportunity cost cannot be accepted it is ruled out, then the decision is very clear that we should I wear this discount of 200 rupees	test
audio_0_34332.wav	Also jumbling up the order of statements and function definitions in this way, makes it much harder to read the program and understand what it is doing	test
audio_0_209477.wav	Here, in the first angle projection size always be our the views on which we are going to project, those will be opaque and the direction through which we are going to see will be transparent	test
audio_0_9093.wav	Find the value of R L for which the source delivers maximum, it will be to this maximum power right power is using	test
audio_0_205154.wav	For this we have to select one any one of the part	test
audio_0_146170.wav	You can specify this as a constant or you can also specify some register, logical shift left by r5; whatever is the value in r5 that many bits will be shifted	test
audio_0_99124.wav	So we write it down in terms of this value is equal to 1 by 1 plus delta 1 plus entire set in the denominator 1 by delta 1 plus 1 by delta 2 plus 1 by delta 3 but we also know that because of this because of the fact that the reciprocal of the stiffness is going to give you the deflection 1 by k 1 plus 2 plus 3 the total stiffness of the peer group is going to be the summation of the corrected deflections delta 1 delta 2 plus delta 3 so each of those therefore the the deflection of the pure group is if you use this which is nothing but because deflections and the stiffnesses are reciprocals and the first expression we can then arrive at the total deflection this is of the peer group this is of the individual peers	test
audio_0_65787.wav	so this notation i am just repeating for your convenience: this i and j indicate two blocks	test
audio_0_84970.wav	So, it means in this case you prepare the balance sheet here, that is the budgeted balance sheet and in this side we are taking the capital and liabilities	test
audio_0_214364.wav	If we are looking that we are supposed to see these legs here and there is a sudden rise, sudden rise on that and it goes meets at this location, after that looks like there might be something like a cylindrical kind of object	test
audio_0_132814.wav	Now in contrast in private inheritance, if you look at the same thing the same set of classes, the same functions, the same to P and S, eat P will work, but what is see eat S, if you have defined this as a private inheritance	test
audio_0_107380.wav	So, I thought of how we go through the data sheet and let us see, how are what are the parameters given and whether we understand those parameter, whether we can solve some equations solve some problems regarding to that particular parameters right	test
audio_0_120749.wav	So, for this we will have some equilibrium distance	test
audio_0_155622.wav	So, and I capital I 3 is equal to I 4 because this is a last node I 3 is equal to I 4	test
audio_0_178778.wav	So you can say that the component of I 2 flowing through 2 ohm resistance is nothing but he negative of the current flowing that is the negative of the current I 1	test
audio_0_45156.wav	So, why	test
audio_0_102258.wav	So, in this typically you will get all the bars in tension, but whether or not all the bars would actually reach the peak value, the permissible tensile force ASI into FS is something that is typically not seen	test
audio_0_4109.wav	Similarly, if you subtract equation 1 from equation 2 right; that is, equation 2 minus equation 1, you will get P 2 minus P 1 is equal to V L I L sin theta right or if, you multiply both side by root 3 then root 3 V L I L sin theta is equal to root 3 into P 2 minus P, minus P 1 right	test
audio_0_107172.wav	Assume that the input voltage is 3	test
audio_0_149767.wav	You have a controlled environment, but there could be cases where you still have a better control over the environment, but it is not real lab set up actually	test
audio_0_137138.wav	So, on the left column, what you see, does not use static member it is what you have been introduced to earlier in terms of the data members and member function	test
audio_0_101019.wav	Once you have all those black dots then the intersection of the best fit line, this red line being the best fit line, intersection of the best fit line will give you tau knot	test
audio_0_181838.wav	But if I draw the same thing D Q as here, but if I put a triangle and I write enable, then this triangle symbol means this is a level triggered D flip flop sorry edge triggered D flip flop	test
audio_0_43994.wav	So, it will give you numerical convergence, but you have solved Laplace equations, instead of Maxwell’s equations equation	test
audio_0_214418.wav	These three points are given	test
audio_0_153629.wav	this is the impedance of the branch	test
audio_0_83745.wav	And when you talk about the management of the cash we compare it sometimes with the management of inventory	test
audio_0_216620.wav	here you are not measuring any temperature, you are only using it for motion detection	test
audio_0_109986.wav	What will happen if I do that	test
audio_0_121582.wav	We also need the occupation probability; you can assume that the occupation is a simple Boltzmann function	test
audio_0_167627.wav	T1 has execution time of one, period one, deadline, sorry, period four, deadline four	test
audio_0_112387.wav	10 ampere current, next common ground, right here see volt, resistance, temperature, hertz, milliampere, micro ampere means you can if you measure voltage, you can connect to this particular terminal	test
audio_0_40801.wav	So, your number of unknowns	test
audio_0_207392.wav	So, this is coincident mate	test
audio_0_127297.wav	25% of the transducer range, it should not drift, meaning that the zero should not keep on changing by itself, it should be stable and it should have the right polarity, this is very very important and what does this mean	test
audio_0_179777.wav	So, now, the value of current flowing delta I would be the value of Vc which you will see in the voltage source would be I into delta R	test
audio_0_197314.wav	Now, corresponding to this I am going definitely have a higher voltage but please note I have already attained close to saturation because of which the voltage has increased only slightly may be 118 or 119 V	test
audio_0_119517.wav	So, on this side, I have a p type semiconductor at the center, I have an intrinsic and here I have an n type	test
audio_0_214101.wav	So, this one if from apex all the way to centre of the circle, if we are joining that may not be 90 degrees; it makes an angle alpha, such kind of cones are called right circular cones, and these are generally named as cones	test
audio_0_201079.wav	It is a very popular way of biasing the circuit	test
audio_0_210054.wav	In two dimensions if we are seeing that, it makes 120 degrees angle, in between these sides	test
audio_0_10888.wav	Suppose, this is your what you call this side is A and this side is B	test
audio_0_123458.wav	By adding a really small amount of arsenic, so much small that it is of the order of parts per billion, we have increase the conductivity by more than 5 orders of magnitude	test
audio_0_4142.wav	44 degree Ampere	test
audio_0_72462.wav	it is at least greater than ninty five percent	test
audio_0_165206.wav	so you are ready	test
audio_0_72763.wav	any edge you cut it will divide up into two parts, because you know a tree is a kind of a graph where there is a unique path between two vertices	test
audio_0_84508.wav	It take some time is not that easy that you any time you want to sell the securities into market	test
audio_0_184902.wav	And, we will also have another term, so this will get multiplied by e to the power some call it sigma t or minus sigma t	test
audio_0_86131.wav	So, generally whenever we talk about muscle culture, we talked about there are 2 possible ways and here we will talk about say skeletal muscle	test
audio_0_116647.wav	Now if the server actually sent the same challenge again, the man in the middle the attacker would be able to actually respond to that corresponding challenge without actually forwarding the challenge to the device	test
audio_0_69651.wav	lets say some of the point here	test
audio_0_215185.wav	And you start with the following introduction	test
audio_0_129349.wav	Now control of DEF of course we have to understand whether it is really a problem depending upon the situation it can be a problem, if you have very high temperatures during precasting so generally because of that most concrete it says the specification for concrete construction typically put a limit on the maximum temperature permissible inside the concrete	test
audio_0_20404.wav	Hello and welcome back to this module on empathize	test
audio_0_80550.wav	In between this and this the variance will be called as the sales activity variance, sales activity variance and this column will be known as the flexible budget variance	test
audio_0_40670.wav	So, it is going to be if I am going to use my fantastic drawing skills this would be alpha then gamma and beta and it is a plane that is at suspended by these heights over here ok	test
audio_0_140871.wav	So, this particular function becomes drawRec function and so on	test
audio_0_138896.wav	And then in the last module, we have formally introduced a Notion of Binding	test
audio_0_155225.wav	5 V1 is magnitude V1 square into the V2 square plus r 1 square plus x 1 square into P 2 square plus Q 2 square is equal to 0, this rewriting equation what this number is 74, right	test
audio_0_44648.wav	So, now, proceeding further towards our actual objective, what we did right now was the general derivation	test
audio_0_2102.wav	In this case of in that case of squirrel cage motor all these things are not there because rotor itself is shorted	test
audio_0_92522.wav	So, effort is measured normally person month	test
audio_0_150020.wav	I was looking at her history, I heard interview of her mother, who said that in the family nobody is into wrestling, but then they go on to say that Sakshis grandfather happened to be a wrestler	test
audio_0_16762.wav	So, just let me clear it	test
audio_0_113311.wav	So, this is how you can derive the formula for the magnitude of voltage gain, in case of the low pass active filter	test
audio_0_16894.wav	So, so many you know, in this case, now we are seeing that your RC circuit	test
audio_0_57251.wav	and this session and the next one will be solving a assignment, number five and assignment number six	test
audio_0_58355.wav	we know bound surface charges are nothing but p	test
audio_0_5780.wav	So, this way your B H loop will be completed right	test
audio_0_124309.wav	This is the apparent wavelength and this term is related to the frequency like this	test
audio_0_203833.wav	I have the resistor R1 over there	test
audio_0_207427.wav	So, if we want to demonstrate this tangent mate we will select this surface and this slot path holding the control and click on mate	test
audio_0_148116.wav	This is the Arduino Uno board, this is the 5 volt pin, which is connected to the GSM 5 volt pin	test
audio_0_131257.wav	So, we will be using a combination of two axial extensometer one is axial extensometer, another one is a video extensometer and with combination of this we will be trying to find the strain variation or the displacement in this material with respect to the load acting on the element	test
audio_0_178037.wav	So, let us first write the mathematical equation for the translational mechanical system, which you are seeing in the figure	test
audio_0_134125.wav	So, if we use the public data that is if we do not enforce information hiding then you can very well see that between these two codes, which both of each are actually trying to take a string and reverse it	test
audio_0_40447.wav	How do I simplify further, do I have a relation that tells me what is del cross B, do I have a relation that tells me del cross H	test
audio_0_63501.wav	so so if this is not ensured, your this operation of this circuit might fail, ok	test
audio_0_64287.wav	so percentage of the faults in f that can be detected by t	test
audio_0_52853.wav	So based on this, you know this, you know this by design, this by design, this by design, this can be the value, data sheet value chosen from the other chosen device	test
audio_0_109181.wav	If I go for 159 hertz, it is decreasing, because now this is slightly below our cut off frequency	test
audio_0_50336.wav	So, what we do in this coordinate stretching approach is going to be very interesting	test
audio_0_70294.wav	you see what is physical verification	test
audio_0_101340.wav	A standard prism is made by stacking one brick over another and having about five or six bricks in one stack	test
audio_0_44734.wav	Now I want to calculate more complicated problems for which there is no analytical solution	test
audio_0_13999.wav	So, half L is 0	test
audio_0_138412.wav	And certainly while building the data type, there are certain point to keep in mind which I would specifically like to remind you off is a fact that while you bring a data type	test
audio_0_4638.wav	So, if you plot like this it will be and an omega C minus 1 upon L omega less than 0	test
audio_0_31550.wav	We have two alternative modes of operation it is an error to try an append to a non existent key, but if there is an existing key we do not want to lose it by reassigning s	test
audio_0_110168.wav	iImpedance in this condition is minimum, which is resistance R	test
audio_0_139217.wav	Which I would like to little bit highlight you to	test
audio_0_166227.wav	Just to give an example of a real time system let us say that in a chemical reactor if the temperature exceeds 500 degrees, then the coolant shower must be turned down within 100 milliseconds	test
audio_0_48796.wav	So, in the transmitting mode I am going to draw the circuit equivalent of antenna right	test
audio_0_208566.wav	For example, if it is a cast iron or general use of all materials we show it by incline 45 degrees lines as a hatch and these are the parallel lines we have to really represent	test
audio_0_167239.wav	Its period and deadline are the same	test
audio_0_32542.wav	Now if I say CSV line dot split using comma as a separator and then I get a list of values the string 6, the string 7, the string 8	test
audio_0_137504.wav	So, this is called an input streaming operator, It is again a pair of arrows, but the arrows now direct in the left from left to right	test
audio_0_180929.wav	Now, let us compare these two instruments; so two instruments two meters; this is one, this is another	test
audio_0_34588.wav	And as you will later see, it also plays a major role in what happens when we pass values to functions as arguments	test
audio_0_207953.wav	Some of them about size, position, how to represent them and for example, if there are any diameters how to represent them	test
audio_0_3203.wav	So, in that case this is in active right it is short it is shorted	test
audio_0_215040.wav	Primarily, students do not get the opportunity for immediate application and practice after they learn the content from each of the interactive videos	test
audio_0_33729.wav	So, we take board dot queen dot keys will give us 0 1 upto N minus 1 in some random order we sort them and for each such row we print the row and the column number for that row	test
audio_0_205000.wav	So, this kind of dimensioning which we are going to learn it in this lecture	test
audio_0_194443.wav	So if I have a circuit for example that I am going to have an alternating voltage then may be a resistance may be an inductance, another resistance may be a capacitance and another resistance, it is not going to be very easy for me to draw for each of them, let us say I call this as iL, I call this as iR1, and I call this as iR2, let me call this as may be i through C and let me call this is iR3 and when I add these that is these two currents I will be able to get what is iR3 and when I add the voltage drops across these two elements and this element I will be able to get what is the voltage source, but it’s not going to be easy for me to draw all these phases and add them	test
audio_0_42745.wav	What will have	test
audio_0_50315.wav	So, at the boundary, what is the value of n	test
audio_0_195276.wav	And because it is made up of silicon steel or ferromagnetic material to establish a flux which will cause electromagnetic induction in the secondary side I would not require a large amount of MMF	test
audio_0_139211.wav	So, while you do the design of classes please keep this point in mind because copy assignment operator is a very critical operator which needs to be overloaded	test
audio_0_70009.wav	ok, so these are some of the techniques which are usually used	test
audio_0_8339.wav	Now, similarly now that is I that is i1 enters the dotted terminal of coil 1	test
audio_0_69489.wav	but spice is a circuit simulation tool which is pretty accurate	test
audio_0_4176.wav	So, , we will come back to this	test
audio_0_33418.wav	This tells that I am going to read from infile and write to outfile	test
audio_0_212621.wav	Now, next to Sketch there is something like Features button	test
audio_0_114038.wav	Now it features go through at a very high level, we just look at this invocation, we see that the e value is used over here, essentially e i would indicate the ith be present in e	test
audio_0_38101.wav	Also, I think the adults who are into care giving should not be hyper sensitive to small changes	test
audio_0_209063.wav	For parallel projections which are quite common for our engineering drawing course and machine designing kind of courses there are two types of projections exists, one is orthogonal projection, other one is oblique projection	test
audio_0_54546.wav	So this would be the the input output relationship for the forward converter that we have drawn shown here and when this inductor when the inductor when the inductor here is freewheeling in this fashion, this diode is off, secondary is open, the primary is also freewheeling in this fashion	test
audio_0_50466.wav	Method of moments	test
audio_0_207723.wav	So, all this line has to be rotated in that direction	test
audio_0_125151.wav	This time, power gain or operating power gain comes across frequently, now what is this power gain	test
audio_0_106919.wav	We have seen how to fabricate an inter digitated electrode in an SU 8 well and how to fabricate a gas sensor	test
audio_0_83842.wav	Now how we have arrived at this profit	test
audio_0_151440.wav	4 kilowatt per phase	test

audio_0_127724.wav	Even at 4 percent chloride that is lower than the 3 percent chloride at 30 milli amps per meter square so it also depends on how quickly we apply the charge, so on the current density basically as to how successful we are going to be in stopping corrosion So that proved the idea of using a 2 stage cathodic protection method	test
audio_0_130855.wav	So, the NaOH side of the compartment is connected to the positive and NaCl side is connected to the negative and the potential of about 60 volts is applied	test
audio_0_208428.wav	Now, let us ask a question if a cylinder or cone is placed on horizontal plane, how it looks like, what are the projections for the solid	test
audio_0_39216.wav	So, accordingly you can set the timer value that for getting that delay	test
audio_0_40620.wav	So, similar accounting happens in the case of two dimensions ok	test
audio_0_190852.wav	So you can look at DC current as an equivalent per phase AC current in a 3 phase system	test
audio_0_33483.wav	Now it might be that the solution that we are trying to get does not work	test
audio_0_69154.wav	so you cannot reduce the height, which is eight lambda by eleven lambda	test
audio_0_49552.wav	Well in this case infinity by infinity from I can do it in either way right	test
audio_0_133556.wav	And therefore, this will result in ambiguity	test

audio_0_163409.wav	To put it in specific terms, it states that accountant should not anticipate any income but shall provide for all possible losses	test
audio_0_135379.wav	So, all of these assuming that you have a pointer to some type which is not known and, since you do not know the type while you actually want to do the comparison in the return statement of the compare function, you will have to first tell the compiler that, what indeed I now have is an integer	test
audio_0_70295.wav	as the name implies, we are trying to verify something through physical inspection	test
audio_0_205041.wav	75 in this case	test
audio_0_207472.wav	So, now, it enters the bolt and we can see this see the threads uncovering one by one as the nut revolves into the bolt	test
audio_0_52672.wav	That is what	test
audio_0_193686.wav	I am neglecting the losses, so I am not writing the losses at all	test
audio_0_154796.wav	So, note that distribution negatives are along the stroke path; so all the plus, minus signs are shown in this diagram	test

audio_0_141155.wav	We will again show in this module that why global and member function solution for operator overloading fail in such cases and how the friend could help	test
audio_0_116639.wav	Essentially it would look at the Hamming distance between the two and determine whether this response has actually originated from this specific device so in this way the edge device will be authenticated	test
audio_0_111935.wav	wWhatever we learn in theory applied, is applied in some form and let us see in few lectures from after this particular module, how we are going to use the operation amplifiers and MOSFETs for the from the experiment point of view, all right	test
audio_0_67756.wav	so there is one issue that arises here	test
audio_0_142743.wav	We had already brought out the distinction between these 2 reports	test
audio_0_59981.wav	please do not confuse between this v and this v	test
audio_0_198848.wav	So it is not a great option if I am trying to start an induction motor which is probably coupled to a hoist, coupled to an electric vehicle or coupled to an elevator because those things require a high starting torque, whereas here the torque is going to be very very limited, I am not going to get a good amount of torque	test
audio_0_213159.wav	From K point, pick another arbitrary point P such that AP is smaller than PK; so something like this is greater distance	test

audio_0_111811.wav	After you compensate your probe, then and then only start using your oscilloscope, all right	test
audio_0_53424.wav	Now during this time D1 and D4 are conducting and other two diodes are conducting during this period d2 and d3 so basically this would form the diode currents and if you if you calculate if you draw the waveform for a in the input current this is the wave shape for during the positive half cycle and during the negative half cycle this would be in reverse like this now this is the wave shape for the input current	test
audio_0_116474.wav	Okay, so the first thing we need to do is find where libc is present	test
audio_0_139860.wav	But in addition, rose has some additional properties that is why you would like to specialize that	test
audio_0_58494.wav	we want to find this now	test
audio_0_179611.wav	Now, once the value of k i are known, we can easily find out the inverse Laplace transform for F s	test
audio_0_40167.wav	Is the flux through it is the flux through dl in the normal direction, over here was in that the same interpretation is a flux of A	test
audio_0_183167.wav	So, let us put that value V o R 1 plus V i R 2 divided by R 1 plus R 2; this has to be greater than 0	test
audio_0_82109.wav	Which formula will be applied here	test
audio_0_129626.wav	So we see that the total solid volume that is to say this part plus this part is now roughly double the original solid volume we had at the beginning	test
audio_0_194009.wav	I will not have the torque due to rotor side current because rotor side current zero and I will not have is ir into d is by d theta because I am not having ir at all,right	test
audio_0_86275.wav	so this theta prime value, which is the value, what you have do plug into the stoneys equation and this will give you the force generated by the myotube	test
audio_0_80660.wav	The first situation is when the actual weight of the mix first case when the actual weight of mix and the actual weight of the mix and the standard weight of the mix, do not differ	test
audio_0_50788.wav	So, this is as far as tangential boundary conditions go the other	test
audio_0_193177.wav	So if you are going to have actually the current flowing through the DC motor drive, which is inductive because La is there	test
audio_0_25013.wav	46 into 16 into 10 into 410 by 1	test
audio_0_166290.wav	But then if there are multiple tasks synchronization among the tasks you need to manage the memory, like memory demanding tasks, we need to store data in file, we need to network to other devices, we need graphics displays, we need to interface with a wide range of IO devices, we need to have buffering of the IO applications, security, power management, etcetera	test
audio_0_108026.wav	One is your negative feedback, another one is your positive feedback	test
audio_0_80957.wav	And it is very useful for the small scale industries especially for those firms who do not have a say desired credit rating and who are little say you can call it as uhhh not having a very good financial position in the market whom the banks sometime are reluctant to lend the funds	test
audio_0_105428.wav	Now you know, what areare band pass filters	test
audio_0_62555.wav	so let us do that	test
audio_0_144855.wav	There are instances where the universities can also file it internally, but it will require a different kind of a setup and different kind of professionals to do that	test
audio_0_173040.wav	Now, node is the network node of a network is defined as a point where two or more branches are joined	test
audio_0_426.wav	So, how to find it out right	test
audio_0_158801.wav	Namaste In last three sessions we have discussed a lot about financial statement analysis and its interpretations	test
audio_0_74551.wav	Payment for, payment for salaries, wages, commission and other variable expenses and other variable expenses	test
audio_0_103562.wav	So, this particular example, we will use this example to estimate what the eccentricity is and then from the eccentricity arrive at what the design forces are going to be to the walls in the in plain direction	test
audio_0_70414.wav	for this first test vector, or first test vector, t one is zero, one, zero, one zero	test
audio_0_43514.wav	So, can we say when the field is not unique and set a example	test
audio_0_82774.wav	If that information is given about the units produced and sold, then how to treat that	test
audio_0_129915.wav	And now one this is some examples which we did it in our lab, you can see here the blue curve here is for OPC concrete and then the red curve here is for the fly ash based concrete and then the black curves are for a new type of concrete which is made out of LC3 cement	test
audio_0_139775.wav	For example, this is a member like a r e components of a complex number i m component of a complex number or so, I would need to read and set the value of this component if I am reading a complex number	test
audio_0_39960.wav	So, might a what beam as sent through it, but in optics particularly they are there are non linearity	test
audio_0_198547.wav	I understand that this is not exactly equivalent to the radius but assuming that it is a big circle	test
audio_0_190913.wav	So I am going to have Xs value to be really really large	test
audio_0_176516.wav	So means that we have to convert first this circuit into Laplace domain that is S domain	test
audio_0_201612.wav	But the point is to understand the systematic method so that if you have to do it, you have to be able to go through all the possibilities systematically, you have to consider all the possibilities systematically and eliminate all the wrong ones	test
audio_0_60824.wav	as a second example, i will take a heat of charge in the x y plain carrying a current, let's say in the y direction, surface current	test
audio_0_73327.wav	around the x axis you see the years starting from nineteen seventy up to two thousand fifteen, which is shown here	test
audio_0_177239.wav	So, what you can do you can arrange them in such a way that it looks like there are 3 different voltage sources	test
audio_0_60641.wav	now, in finding the curl of h, we know that the point dipole is placed at the origin, r equal to zero	test
audio_0_34135.wav	Similarly, if I leave out the last position it runs to the end of the string	test
audio_0_180449.wav	I want to plot the strength of this magnetic field as a function of time ok	test
audio_0_69679.wav	there are methods like breuers algorithm and some modification, terminal propagation, and there are some other methods also: cluster growth, force directed also	test
audio_0_126159.wav	But then at port 3, where constructive interference happens, there there is addition of power	test
audio_0_105475.wav	Again, we have seen in the theory class how we can understand what are the phases, right	test
audio_0_109008.wav	This is already given here	test
audio_0_62854.wav	so each of this rough connections and actually map to horizontal and vertical segments	test
audio_0_159795.wav	Whatever is a portion related to loss of machinery that will be considered as a cash inflow due to investing activity	test
audio_0_82721.wav	And what is the gross profit	test
audio_0_65762.wav	so you do not have enough space to keep e either to the right or left	test
audio_0_83985.wav	Application of the marginal costing as a technique of costing, very useful technique of management decision making has to be applied here for the different applications which I told you that those different applications if you talk about here the applications of marginal costing which we discussed in the previous class all these decision making process fixation of selling price buying or make or buy decision key or limiting factor effect of change in the selling price so and so forth we will be now learning some basic concepts of the market costing which will be useful in say taking the different decisions in the different market situations	test
audio_0_72290.wav	and if we can layout this kind of a network, we shall see later how we can have a very regular layout of the clock tree which can ensure the equalization of not only the buffer delays but also the delays of the interconnections, so that way you can ensure your overall delay will be means equalized and skew will be minimized	test
audio_0_63176.wav	lets look at some of the existing methods which have been proposed for this net weighting, how they how they make the estimates	test
audio_0_184734.wav	Now if R V is very high then this current will be almost equal to 0 and this current according to current divider rule this is I multiplied by R V divided by R V plus R X	test
audio_0_178217.wav	So various appliances will have their own current level	test
audio_0_149727.wav	There is another format of observation what is called as Subjective Observation	test
audio_0_203345.wav	So let me also label these this is G1, D1 and S1 meaning that they are gate drain and source of the most transistor M1	test
audio_0_19620.wav	The kids do not figure this out, I doubt that but anyway the assumption is that and they are able to open by only adults who figure this out is pressing on top and opening it	test
audio_0_7.wav	And these two dots are here, this is basically the neutral zone right	test
audio_0_17719.wav	You said you write notes regularly, so do you refer those notes while you prepare for the exam	test
audio_0_49912.wav	What about the entire x axis sorry the entire y axis	test
audio_0_182615.wav	It takes a binary number in as a input and gives a continuous output	test
audio_0_32633.wav	As before we can directly translate this into an inductive into a recursive program	test
audio_0_76107.wav	We checked up the total, you can call it as the number of hours	test
audio_0_176104.wav	So, now have got another equation first is this equation, second you have got from the Kirchhoff Current Law	test
audio_0_46345.wav	Do we know how to integrate over a special kind of triangle, supposing I give you a unit triangle ok	test
audio_0_209675.wav	So, our vertical plane now looks like this	test
audio_0_183245.wav	So, when we connected here the voltage increases and when we connected here the voltage decreases	test
audio_0_122979.wav	Now we will be mainly dealing with the second type of photo detectors, where your photons generate electron hole pairs	test
audio_0_36023.wav	So, we say that this is 4 not because we did plus 3 because s is not equal to b, we did 4 because we got the max value from here, why is this 4 again i is not equal to s	test
audio_0_24114.wav	2 right 118	test
audio_0_39773.wav	Sir, in coordinates we have r theta and phi right This is 2 D polar coordinates; you are thinking of 3D cylindrical 3D spherical coordinates where there is a r theta and phi but this is just a 2 D problem, so there is no phi yeah	test
audio_0_129395.wav	It has many cement plants there because it has rich limestone deposits	test
audio_0_209640.wav	And, this one what we call front view and this one top view	test
audio_0_176658.wav	So, let us say that 1 function ft we have and we are associating 1 direct delta function with it	test
audio_0_205658.wav	If we are drawing that will be 20 mm and 30 mm in front of vertical plane	test
audio_0_16417.wav	It is 2 less than t and other this way you can when t greater than 2 right	test
audio_0_15249.wav	This is just for purpose of general knowledge will not study that	test
audio_0_215411.wav	And also the teaching and learning activities should be designed such that they facilitate effective achievement of those learning outcomes and subsequent assessment tasks	test
audio_0_175102.wav	So in this session, we discussed about the Network Synthesis in detail and also carried out our discussion on Network Stability	test
audio_0_171287.wav	Manusov and Patterson have reflected on the potentially important eye behavior for teachers which they have termed as the “teacher stare” and we often use it to manage the students class room behavior	test
audio_0_37515.wav	Let so, you do not find	test
audio_0_43949.wav	So, you have to write wrapper that will correctly read in the data in a pass the coma whatever all of that	test
audio_0_203985.wav	And when is it large when VD is large and positive when I say large and positive VD must be much more than the thermal voltage	test
audio_0_177430.wav	Similar exercise can be done with the help of converting cos into sign and then comparing with the voltage V2	test
audio_0_206800.wav	So, for that problem what we have done	test
audio_0_12648.wav	So, now when it is switching on it is a value has given 10 volt, v t right, it is a 10 volt	test
audio_0_19321.wav	So this again it is like the same process of design thinking applying itself into this evolution of the product concept within itself	test
audio_0_179135.wav	So, in this mechanical system we have one motor connected to a load through shaft which has the friction coefficient as we will rather say stiffness coefficient as K which defines the torsional spring coefficient	test
audio_0_36976.wav	And also we do not have many vocational rehabilitation centers and things like that; even I see people with dementia, a psychologist will sit and make them a home based plan which is half understood, half not understood; the people because of their financial thing are unable	test
audio_0_179258.wav	So, if you see the figure you will see that the flow of current is opposite to the direction of flow of electrons	test
audio_0_35197.wav	And Python being a simple language to start working with and to use and itÕs nice built in things like dictionaries and stuff like that, exception handling, are done in a very nice way, so it makes it very attractive to learn	test
audio_0_111834.wav	What is the position	test
audio_0_32620.wav	In general, when we do insertion sort we will find that we need to sort things a segment of the list	test
audio_0_113951.wav	Now 1st of all creating this bit fault is extremely difficult and furthermore we would require 128 such bit falls to completely extract the secret key of AES	test
audio_0_138687.wav	So, create, report, detect, handle, and recover are the basic five stages through any exception can be handled	test
audio_0_107964.wav	Now, here today we will be understanding what exactly an inverting amplifier is	test
audio_0_195242.wav	So these are two types of construction depending upon where I cannot tolerate more reluctance I have to adopt this construction, shell type construction, right	test
audio_0_191703.wav	If the armature carries current, it is definitely going to throw its own spanner into the entire field of things, so I am going to have some variation in the flux, in the form of something called armature reaction	test
audio_0_60036.wav	remember earlier, when i was discussing this, this formula, i had said that in the continuous distribution, this row r d, v, integrated over smaller and smaller volume	test
audio_0_203729.wav	The distance between drain to source is the length and the width of this region through which the current flows that is the width W	test
audio_0_209867.wav	By rotating it so, that I will get a b 2 then transfer that a b 2 all the way up, then extend this line get this one, this will be the true length	test
audio_0_174368.wav	So, this we will analyze when we'll discuss about convolution integral	test
audio_0_83906.wav	After calculating this GP, this GP comes here by GP now, this amount of 30,000 will come here	test
audio_0_51438.wav	The system of equations accepts it only at gamma in the total field formulation	test
audio_0_103007.wav	So, what really the basis of this experiment is very interesting to see how the physical behavior under compression and shear has then been nicely translated to an analytical form, idealized into an analytical form	test
audio_0_110336.wav	Once you calculate I b plus, I b minus, you have to take the difference of I b plus and I b minus, and then again you see some mode some mode	test
audio_0_11209.wav	Therefore, your equivalent circuit say this is R 1 and X 1	test

audio_0_58177.wav	let's take m in the z direction with magnitude m	test
audio_0_71851.wav	now a simple latch that uses gates is shown here	test
audio_0_161948.wav	Keep in mind that the whole exercise of financial accounting is mainly for preparation of financial statements which are intended for external users	test
audio_0_194624.wav	Let me explain it once again separately drawing a diagram,ok, somewhat like this, I am going to have actually the magnetic field direction like this this is the magnetic field direction,right	test
audio_0_47845.wav	Right so, due to causality this will becomes 0 due to causality and for the same reason we are going to limit our upper limit to t right otherwise this will like E at future time instance will also come over here right	test
audio_0_86972.wav	But one thing which I personally have felt is that somewhere these books are more or less like a protocol book, but cell culture has such as not just a mere protocol is definitely, there is a significant part of it which is protocol driven just like an molecular biology in a manual, even you can go through it, but a still molecular biology has a subject has tremendous amount of chemical logics and unless you understand that you will be working like a blind person; that is precisely what happens in cell culture that my young student or young enthusiast take under graduate or a post graduate; just embraces that this is technically just let follow it	test
audio_0_210976.wav	Right now my hands are not touching mouse, but I have already clicked that circle icon, so still it is maintaining on that monitor	test
audio_0_111216.wav	But then you have to do it by yourself	test
audio_0_112931.wav	So, what is that E beam evaporators cannot be used in MOSFET because x rays will damage the substrates and dielectric	test
audio_0_170826.wav	Therefore, a stereotyping is a habit should always be avoided in the context of interpreting the body language of other interactants	test
audio_0_117212.wav	However, as we have seen there are many cases or many circuits where making such designs is incredibly difficult to do	test
audio_0_83782.wav	So, this is the one important point which has to be born in mine that cash is the earlier profit where is the profit is if it is only profit then it is a nominal profit	test
audio_0_102098.wav	So, we use that as the basis of the shear strength but then enhance this because you have sigma not here and this sigma not can now be replaced with not only that coming from compressive stress due to the vertical load but also due to the interaction force	test
audio_0_149708.wav	So, hypothesis that you initially made once you realize that repeatedly the hypothesis gets proven this hypothesis gets converted into theories	test
audio_0_194700.wav	So let me try to draw the winding diagram also towards the end	test
audio_0_11913.wav	So, now this capacitor actually initially assumed, it was charged say some volt[age] say some voltage say v 0 not necessarily that it will be charged all the time v 0 can be 0 also	test
audio_0_16937.wav	So, it is 1 by 3 divided by 4 by 3 right	test
audio_0_195301.wav	And I am applying a voltage of V1 here, I am expecting that a voltage of V2 I should get here	test
audio_0_19894.wav	Edison from the general electric actually gave it a shot	test

audio_0_32481.wav	So, we will see all this in this lecture	test
audio_0_14011.wav	So, little bit you should be careful right, so with your what you call	test
audio_0_41858.wav	So, you have reactive I mean the resistance part is about you know as I mentioned 80 Ohms 75 80 Ohms, and the input the reactance part is almost exactly 0 and both methods are giving the same answers	test
audio_0_9181.wav	64 plus j 7	test
audio_0_61488.wav	so this is i will call description of a wave propagating with speed v along the positive x axis	test
audio_0_171443.wav	People when they are being emotional upset the feeling channel is down here and to the right whereas, we quite often see people when they are talking to themselves, they will look down and to the left as they formulate an answer to something	test
audio_0_127076.wav	If just at the operating point of the circuit you can ensure that the circuit is stable then that is enough and in fact in the next module we shall be discussing how potentially unstable circuit can be made stable	test
audio_0_59409.wav	we have learnt that energy density in a magnetic field b is given as one over two, mu zero, b square	test
audio_0_69363.wav	ok, so there can be an x or gate here, so one input will come from here, one input from here, like this	test
audio_0_75022.wav	So, if you look at this entire process, if you backtrack now what we have, means where we started from while preparing this budget and where we have ended up is we have ended up with the two statements	test
audio_0_59818.wav	So, I have to put in minus sign out of here which I can equally well write as 1 over 4 pi Epsilon 0, q 1 q 2 over r 1 2 square r 2 1, where r 2 1 is a unit vector form 2 to 1, r 2 1 should be unit vector	test
audio_0_86236.wav	so you must have seen a person kind of standing here and and this moves like back and forth, like this, and then this person jumps into the water	test
audio_0_37816.wav	Yeah, that is true, that is true	test
audio_0_167704.wav	The original Unix developers wanted an efficient operating system and they did not visualize the use of Unix in real time and multiprocessor applications	test
audio_0_149306.wav	The 50th division is the addiction psychology division which basically looks at addictive behavior including problematic use of alcohol nicotine and other drugs disorders which involves gambling eating sexual behavior or spending is also taken care by psychologists, who work in this very area the 51st division is of psychological study of men and masculinity	test
audio_0_175659.wav	5 ampere current source	test
audio_0_211973.wav	So, if we are taking a circle, for example, let us pick a circle, locate the first point something like P which is going to touch the bottom	test
audio_0_42038.wav	So, domain is the union of both total domain	test
audio_0_156336.wav	Those encoded and rehearsed further move to the long term memory system	test
audio_0_19596.wav	So, they called up a lady in her 60’s, mid 60’s maybe and they said, ‘Ma’am, can we do something to help you	test
audio_0_32301.wav	Here is the code, it is very straight forward we want to find value of v remember, this is this python syntax	test
audio_0_42649.wav	Variables will be same in	test
audio_0_142404.wav	The advantage of these codes is that regardless of in what language the patent is written	test
audio_0_194947.wav	So, I know for sure that probably this side is grounded, it doesn’t matter	test
audio_0_50296.wav	So, let us say that this is my computational domain over here and this wave is coming over here may be it's coming at this angle whatever variety of different angels and I am talking about let us say this boundary	test
audio_0_193851.wav	So, this is going to be again If I say B Square by 2 mue naught multiplied by ag multiplied by lg, lg will just be eliminating when it differentiated that is all	test
audio_0_216993.wav	who holds the topic	test
audio_0_4545.wav	So, in that case yourand maximum and the and in that case has a maximum response to a fixed magnitude of driving force	test
audio_0_35605.wav	There will be my values and there will be other values	test

audio_0_204620.wav	75, this is 3	test
audio_0_11524.wav	So, while we go for single phase as well as three phase ac circuits, at that time this you know this theorem all will remain same, but as AC a AC circuits complex number will be involved	test
audio_0_109418.wav	So, I will ask again Sitaram to come here and connect it	test
audio_0_190697.wav	Due to which for a given voltage and for a given power IL will be minimum when Cos phi is unity, right	test
audio_0_40818.wav	What you are thinking of is Gauss quadrature which is the integral of a function over the given interval, here we are not considering a integration; we just talking about given these 2 nodes how many degrees of freedom are there	test
audio_0_126162.wav	One term that is frequently associated with couplers is what is known as a hybrid coupler	test
audio_0_112292.wav	So, alternatively there is a connection given to this breadboard	test
audio_0_47475.wav	So, you can see that the trapezoidal rule is already over estimating the exact answer and not by some small amount 5 when the actual answer should be 4; so, that is the big change	test
audio_0_136143.wav	In C, we use the mechanism to get a value back from a function; is called return by value mechanism	test
audio_0_134718.wav	The similar observations will happen if you want to return a value, return something from a function by value because we will again need copy constructor to copy the value	test
audio_0_43844.wav	But the main thing is that U is not known, we have not yet come to that problem; so, let us see what happens here	test
audio_0_111467.wav	Diodes and transistors, if required can be externally connected on to its corresponding pins finally; But resistors and capacitors can be integrated	test
audio_0_140304.wav	So to bring it to the actual details, suppose I have a base class B, so I have for this base class I have two functions; one is function f and this function g	test
audio_0_157019.wav	In our young days adulthood usually we do not have this type of problem, unless we are too busy and we are into multitasking then it might happen, because of competition between two thoughts which are going parallel	test
audio_0_201737.wav	So, this is used many times	test
audio_0_39888.wav	So, a few very general points first	test
audio_0_216650.wav	the magnetic fields of line lines of force have been cut, captured by this coil, and essentially a small voltage is developed here which can be used, after suitable power conditioning, to actually power this board ah, um and all the energy is actually stored on this capacitor	test
audio_0_137811.wav	But, the computation necessarily does not start with main	test
audio_0_148084.wav	Mobile Switching Center, a gateway MSC that is Gateway Mobile Switching Center, Home Location Register, and Visitor Location Register, which I have already discussed	test
audio_0_116157.wav	So, note that this format is very similar to the linker view, except that there are few changes	test
audio_0_126409.wav	So this is one method where you have an input matching network and then three individual transistors each of which produce their amplification and then finally at the output of the transistors, the powers are combined through an output matching network	test
audio_0_70727.wav	like cadians, we looked at some design flow in specific emphasis on physical design process, the backend design and also special emphasis on static timing analysis and related issues	test
audio_0_107116.wav	This is the velocity of the water vapor that we can pass through the silicon wafers loaded inside the horizontal tube furnace	test

audio_0_192554.wav	Now, if my machine is rotating in this direction let us say it is rotating in this direction in omega R	test
audio_0_32366.wav	Let us just see how this works through some examples right	test
audio_0_36408.wav	It does so we add to the list of common factors	test
audio_0_100770.wav	You just have to then go ahead and provide minimum steel that is required as per the code, but there is no design steel required for that particular condition	test
audio_0_155179.wav	So, in this case and if you compare if you compare the they result for your P method 1 and method 2, that just what difference we can observe after your what you call after second iteration, right	test
audio_0_34094.wav	So, we actually saw this and we did the gcd, we talked about the last element of the list say the list of common characters, and we said the minus 1th element n the list is the last element	test
audio_0_79171.wav	Whether it was having a static trend or it was having a rising trend or it had a zigzag trend, maybe some time some quarter sales went up and then went down	test
audio_0_101798.wav	125 square root of fm	test
audio_0_118915.wav	So, we find it even for a small increase in the value of n i	test
audio_0_177525.wav	We will first try to find out the total impedance of this particular block	test
audio_0_66125.wav	this is a sub function where, where the other variables remain same, only x	test
audio_0_65070.wav	so this is the so called low power flip flop, which you can use in a design to reduce the signal activity inside the flip flops	test
audio_0_153400.wav	It is I c; this angle is 90 degree and because of that right suppose this angle is delta dash because as you have ah your what you call from this diagram you can make out the current here I dash is equal to I c plus the I; current which is going to the load it is at the receiving end side right	test
audio_0_125758.wav	So, the Z0 is or the characteristic impedance for the E even mode is simply C11	test
audio_0_66835.wav	of course this test generated and response evaluated must be there inside the chip and the additional control circuit, so this will also incurred some area overheads	test
audio_0_149794.wav	So, there is continuity and there is an equal gap between the lines there you know	test
audio_0_183242.wav	Now, what we do, we first connect it to say this switch this integrator, we connect it here to the unknown	test
audio_0_182247.wav	So, then the RMS value of that voltage will be by root 2	test
audio_0_100383.wav	So if you consider a state of pure shear stress, then your principal stresses can be considered on a 45 degree rotated plane, but depending on the magnitude of the normal stresses, you know that the principal stress direction would change	test
audio_0_206488.wav	For example, like a center line instead of a continuous line we would like to draw a Centerline	test
audio_0_128602.wav	So what we see is this, we see that in the top case everything is fine but in the bottom case all of a sudden this huge volume here gets intruded when we force the mercury through this very small pore size here	test
audio_0_46666.wav	But how do I bring in the discrete world	test
audio_0_159509.wav	Now, what are the types and what are the examples of those liabilities	test
audio_0_63192.wav	omega two has a higher weight, ok, so if the slack value is negative you give those nets the higher priority	test
audio_0_134231.wav	And this is what are outline would be the blue part is what we will do first which will significantly covered the function template	test
audio_0_184709.wav	So, this circuit has a problem	test

audio_0_5450.wav	So, in that means, in this case it will be your 6 i 1 this 6 i 1 say you write like this 6 i 1 plus 12 into i 1 minus i 2 this one, because we are moving this you are going to this right minus 12 is equal to 0 right	test
audio_0_147629.wav	In the first experiment, we interface the motor using the circuit that you have just now seen; in addition, we are also interfacing a push button switch like this	test
audio_0_38611.wav	So, it is also done that way	test
audio_0_180635.wav	So, this shortcut is based on the assumption that virtual sorting is true, is happening; the two input terminals are virtually sorted it is based on that assumption ok	test
audio_0_163503.wav	Each year the depreciation is 10,000, first year 10,000, second year 10,000	test

audio_0_100749.wav	Let's say you have a combination of P and M which keeps the wall in region one	test
audio_0_80858.wav	So, plastic component is the or the glass plastic component that is the important component here	test
audio_0_121005.wav	So, will take the example of silver and you will calculate the density of the states and also some values of the Fermi function	test
audio_0_144053.wav	When a person looks at a product and sees that Apple has created or designed that product then, the buyer would attribute so many things because, it has come from that entity	test
audio_0_153406.wav	So finally, it is coming to I dash right	test
audio_0_13516.wav	So, your v 2 will be 6 i 2 here here it is v 2 is equal to 6 i 2	test
audio_0_207261.wav	Now if we are looking at that this is the perpendicular line	test
audio_0_204697.wav	5 dimension from here to here as a point then, I go ahead using my protractor with 45 degrees line and stop it when it is these vertical line going to intersect	test
audio_0_194414.wav	I think this is from Tata Macgraw Hills, it used to be from Tata Macgraw Hills so this is now Macgraw Hill India	test
audio_0_164589.wav	I think they are common for any company, rent, taxes, salaries, travelling expenses, all of them are considered as for running of business	test
audio_0_15276.wav	For example, I want to bring this one this side this side my power glass will be the current magnitude this is I 2 square is the magnitude in to R 2 to this is a power glass, right	test

audio_0_100702.wav	W and the distance from the centroid of the tension reinforcement to the edge compression fiber	test
audio_0_153343.wav	So, the resultant condition is known as overcompensation right	test
audio_0_200669.wav	And again, this is technology dependent, but for the most frequently used flavor of the transistor, the threshold voltage is also greater than 0	test
audio_0_107900.wav	Then this wave is stabilized and inverted by the amplifier	test
audio_0_162594.wav	The net amount is considered as cash generated from operations before taxes minus income tax paid you will get the net cash from operating activities	test
audio_0_183322.wav	This is called a ramp type voltmeter, linear ramp type voltmeter, linear ramp type voltmeter; this is the name we can give to this digital voltmeter ok	test
audio_0_191011.wav	So I can write A times DB, so I am essentially going to replace this by H times LA multiplied by DB which means I can integrate it from minus B max to plus B max, right	test
audio_0_104229.wav	So, there are formulations, there are specific details of these formulations	test
audio_0_107434.wav	Why we need to understand input offset voltage drip	test
audio_0_147108.wav	And for speaker we have set a period of 3 milliseconds that means 333 hertz of frequency will be played on the speaker	test
audio_0_164320.wav	Now, next is R O P A return on total assets or return on assets as it has been called here	test
audio_0_173367.wav	So, basically we started our discussion from week 1 where we discussed about the basic circuit elements and waveforms	test
audio_0_194082.wav	So this is a single phase transformer, then if I am connecting all these three in three phase configuration	test
audio_0_132716.wav	Finally, I have given some I say set of other examples here, showing you that if you have a constant member function then you can still make changes within that constant member function by changing the const ness of this pointer within that member function	test
audio_0_118949.wav	022 ohm inverse and centimeter inverse	test

audio_0_165536.wav	You can pause the video for the time being so that you can complete and verify the solution	test
audio_0_104308.wav	Again, we are examining compression and in a way it's not very different from concrete in its behavior in compression and studies were carried out a few decades ago and they still valid because they do a rather good job in capturing the stress strain behavior of masonry in compression	test
audio_0_8276.wav	So, M 21 mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1 this is the meaning of the suffix right	test
audio_0_146469.wav	Welcome to week 4 of the course	test
audio_0_154188.wav	What should be the sag and tension	test
audio_0_282.wav	So, how to because basically you have to either star to delta and delta to star conversion; so, how we do this	test
audio_0_177498.wav	So lets us understand the superposition and the source transformation theorem with respect to AC circuit analysis	test
audio_0_214848.wav	There are meaningful visuals in the video, there is a dialogue between two children	test
audio_0_137367.wav	So, virtual inheritance basically eliminates that problem, but with one small restriction that for doing this since we have done this automatically we could use only the default constructor the person class	test
audio_0_177798.wav	We can build and study its electrical analogous which is much easier to deal with experimentally	test
audio_0_104966.wav	So, next step would be we after developing, next step would be we will do hard bake	test
audio_0_175230.wav	Now, let us talk about Forward Path Gain	test
audio_0_186043.wav	Therefore, this line will remain same, now if V o increase a bit V P will also increase a bit	test
audio_0_202046.wav	Now, now I said that I will have a source of signal and another additional source of power	test
audio_0_73649.wav	but again, most of the algorithms they do some kind of a systematic transformation of the problem to a, some kind of a layout that uses some kind of a reserved layer model	test
audio_0_214139.wav	The first point what we have to remember is, from slant if we are going in a parallel direction, make a cut section, remove; the top portion the leftover portion on coordinate axis of x and y we see it as parabola	test
audio_0_147134.wav	So, in this experiment what we have seen is that we can have multiple devices interfaced	test
audio_0_177687.wav	So, now you have the initial value of I and initial value of di by dt in your hand which you can utilize to solve the equation	test
audio_0_175405.wav	So, this way you can calculate the value of I1 and I2	test
audio_0_34819.wav	So in this lecture what we have seen is that we can start with a very naive idea which more or less implements the function as it is defined and work our ways to dramatically simplify the algorithm	test
audio_0_168743.wav	The punctuality which is practiced over there and the precision which is preferred in these cultures is reflected in various routines also	test
audio_0_71658.wav	now a days, as i mentioned earlier, also, reduction of power has become of paramount importance	test
audio_0_174051.wav	You will use Kirchhoff's voltage law in each mesh and then you will try to find out what would be the equations for those mesh currents	test
audio_0_4417.wav	Similarly, for parallel equivalent I by V is equal to I P because, it is admittance that is why I by V and is equal to 1 upon R P minus j 1 upon X P is equal to g minus jb right	test
audio_0_145916.wav	You can read the value of the analog voltage through built in A/D converter, you can read the data and you can make a calculation what is the actual temperature outside	test
audio_0_161627.wav	Most of the top rated companies have a high level of reserves	test
audio_0_138941.wav	So, here the call landed at a wrong place	test
audio_0_148065.wav	Then we have Base Station Controller or BSC	test
audio_0_164194.wav	So, you have tried to cover the whole course in 20 hours to discuss important part of accounting	test
audio_0_168619.wav	All types of verbal messages as well as nonverbal messages have their own temporalities	test
audio_0_116610.wav	So, these are the properties of weak PUFs, 1st of all it has been noticed that weak PUFs have very good inter and intra differences	test
audio_0_47862.wav	The problem comes in now when I am explicitly in time domain I have to worry about what is the relation of D and E in time because our Maxwell’s equations the way in the differential form they need time yeah	test
audio_0_176580.wav	It is dimensionless like any other mathematical function such as sine and cosine	test
audio_0_73746.wav	So, it means this cost is equal to this cost and this cost is equal to this cost we have seen in the previous structure also that where both the cost are equal, they are intersecting with each other	test
audio_0_181031.wav	What is the comparator we have studied this	test
audio_0_14261.wav	Look at the cursor, 1 into 2 volt right so; that means, 230 minus 40 into 0	test
audio_0_153974.wav	05 ohm and here in this case everything is given that here no question of iteration or anything because data results are given	test
audio_0_127910.wav	Then we have the usage the structure is used from many many years normally and if not for more than 100 years so the structure is going on being used with sometimes some maintenance some repair, finally it is demolished	test
audio_0_190405.wav	And let me talk about another lambda value which is actually somewhere here which is actually lambda 1	test
audio_0_123710.wav	So, we can substitute in the values and evaluate this expression	test
audio_0_102472.wav	It reaches a maximum if you take a rectangular cross section in a beam that is subjected to vertical shear itself you get a parabolic distribution with the peak shear stress being at the neutral axis	test
audio_0_30249.wav	Now, in case of zig zag bolting, if position will be in a zig zag way, so we have bolting here, then we have bolting here may be again here here	test
audio_0_12690.wav	So it will be 4 t u t minus your 4 t u t minus 3	test
audio_0_36683.wav	If I apply all this then first of all because I have only two digits after decimal point this 3 gets knocked off, and then because it’s set to use 6 character, now if I count from the right, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 characters but it’s set to use 6 characters, that is why there is an extra blank here	test
audio_0_38034.wav	Dyslexia which we will talk about in the next session, maybe autism which I will just try to briefly tell what autism is	test
audio_0_3385.wav	So, rms value is equal to point this rms value is equal to 0	test
audio_0_209787.wav	Similarly, through a also we should draw	test
audio_0_122487.wav	So, I will write this as mu L to denote that it is due to lattice scattering	test
audio_0_65642.wav	and once you have done this, you can fix the thickness of this lines	test
audio_0_105093.wav	20 seconds starts now let us see whether you can understand or not	test
audio_0_42203.wav	So, wherever there is a square grid I assume the epsilon is constant over there	test
audio_0_147354.wav	We again give a delay of 100 millisecond and send the SMS	test
audio_0_177021.wav	Now, if you generalize this particular equation, you can extend it for multiple resistors	test
audio_0_192139.wav	So if it is generator we are not talking about electrical output and if we are talking about motor we are talking about mechanical output, clearly	test
audio_0_120031.wav	So, we now have an electric field and the contact potential between the metal and the semiconductor, just like we had in the case of 2 metals this contact potential depends upon the difference between the work functions	test
audio_0_157488.wav	And even thereafter although we have a memory of it, we have the recollection of only significant events not everything	test
audio_0_10893.wav	This is the area of the coil right	test
audio_0_53249.wav	So how do we implement such a controller and generally that will lead to a improved control action and I will just in a short while redraw this and show you how to implement that	test
audio_0_13991.wav	6 square 2	test
audio_0_137648.wav	Before that, from the time E2 happens and to the time E4 happens, that is, during E3 the object has what is known as an inconsistent state	test
audio_0_192781.wav	So I am showing this as M, this as L and this is a common point	test
audio_0_147275.wav	This is printing some value from LDR; it is getting some value from the analog pin, and after analog to digital conversion it is showing the digital value	test
audio_0_153522.wav	Sometimes book may not be given ah, but sometimes some time re such researching via found that this loss was actually this loss actually can be made it I Id square plus R I q square	test

audio_0_51115.wav	Finite element; so this is finite element ok	test
audio_0_165882.wav	Actually, task scheduling algorithms were the focus of the research in the 1970s and 80s	test
audio_0_5503.wav	Nnow how we are getting it right	test
audio_0_5734.wav	So, there being of reluctance you are comparable to that of the gap right	test
audio_0_68381.wav	ok, and some works have been done where steiner tree with arbitrary orientation, particularly diagonal connections, forty five degree angle connections are also allowed	test
audio_0_209428.wav	And these blocks boxes whatever the first quadrant, second quadrant these are imaginary kind of boxes	test
audio_0_35572.wav	Sometimes, we need to sort values based on different criteria	test
audio_0_165189.wav	Now Jala Ram starts a store on 1st January 2012 with investment of 2 lakhs from his personal savings	test
audio_0_72198.wav	maybe, like i have a certain number of pins where i have to send the clock signal	test
audio_0_40929.wav	Sir could	test
audio_0_75003.wav	The amount to be collected is you can call it as the 100% of 90% of this amount, 4 lakhs	test
audio_0_200059.wav	Now what it means is if the op amp is arranged to be in negative feedback, what does that mean	test
audio_0_132034.wav	It is a pleasure to be here as always and hopefully they will get something from these lectures	test
audio_0_33355.wav	They will remain faithfully as part of your input	test
audio_0_162111.wav	Now, for every entity to calculate the profit you will need to know the incomes and expenses	test
audio_0_126303.wav	Suppose I choose a certain value gamma N and this is the value as say that any time my value of the magnitude of gamma in is below this gamma M, then that frequency range over which magnitude gamma that is for F such that magnitude of gamma in is lesser than gamma N	test
audio_0_54690.wav	VG is the gate drive that you are giving to the VJT or any power semiconductor switch	test
audio_0_84854.wav	So, you have to think about what are my fixed expenses, you have no control upon them	test
audio_0_53960.wav	So this will take some time	test
audio_0_54962.wav	So what is the transfer function between VC and E	test
audio_0_36212.wav	So, an unmarked neighbor is 1 2	test
audio_0_120760.wav	So, the overall energy of Helium 2 is higher than just 2 Helium atoms	test
audio_0_172290.wav	So with this we close todays session	test
audio_0_53422.wav	Now we see that this is the wave shape of the voltage with a ripple and this is the current that is flowing output of the rectifier just before the filter	test
audio_0_145364.wav	So, the first thing is they are enforceable, the second trait is that they are different from normal property we can use the word intangible these rights are intangible	test
audio_0_41557.wav	So, if you do not know chi you also do not know E at that point	test
audio_0_123796.wav	Now let us see let us come back to our definition come back to our transmission lines where we had found out the solution for Vx or Z	test
audio_0_78090.wav	Now the profit planning, you see that you have different products you are manufacturing in any firm, A, B, C, D, four products, for example, we are manufacturing	test
audio_0_179388.wav	You have to first find the expression for voltage	test
audio_0_122221.wav	4 electron volts below the conduction band	test
audio_0_103794.wav	Therefore now we have looked at three different ranges	test
audio_0_14732.wav	Suppose it is not there, if it is not there then this is I I 1 only, this is X m and rest remains same right	test
audio_0_73510.wav	now one thing: you see that here i have shown the connections by different colors	test
audio_0_48881.wav	So, basically what is the current and voltage at the input terminals that is the impedance right	test
audio_0_51049.wav	So, you learn one technique and you have not studied other techniques, so, you applied everywhere we do not want to do that	test
audio_0_154378.wav	And similarly, P L 4 is equal to 600 kilowatt is equal to 0	test
audio_0_217004.wav	if you do as closed standard ah, you are bound to that vendor right for any further improvements or anything	test
audio_0_13527.wav	Substitute in v 1 is equal to 16 i 1, and v 2 is equal to 6 i 2 into equation 2 we will get the substitute	test
audio_0_88877.wav	These cells have lot of you know membrane proteins which are setting there, now if these cells have to adhere to a substrate or adhere to each other they secrete specific cementing materials and by virtue of which these blue arrows coming out are telling or telling about the cementing materials	test
audio_0_214144.wav	For example, let us look at any machine gear or mechanical gears; in automobiles, perhaps for cycle, motor vehicles, even pulley shaft kind of things, the circles are quite common features	test
audio_0_18457.wav	So there is a generic equation where this is the best available content	test
audio_0_17253.wav	So, ; that means, this is your your what you call i 1 infinity is equal to this one	test
audio_0_141470.wav	Since we have done that we have moved the data member here	test
audio_0_11449.wav	98 from which we will get W i is equal to 153 Watt	test
audio_0_70433.wav	there is nothing common	test
audio_0_122482.wav	So, tau due to the scattering of the lattice, I am just going to denoted as tau L is proportional to T to the minus 3 over 2, may call this	test
audio_0_46695.wav	Can you think of a relation or a condition where you will get the ratio that like we got in this case, we got the ratio that omega by k is equal to c over here when I took delta x delta t tending to 0	test
audio_0_53736.wav	Next what we have to do is open G S Shem, GEDS G EDS G G S, put the circuit in it and then use NG Spice to simulate and see the various waveforms and that's what we will do	test
audio_0_76810.wav	We are borrowing this month so we have nothing to pay	test
audio_0_36090.wav	In other words, odd numbers that are not prime, in this particular collection 1 and 9 are examples of odd numbers that are not prime	test
audio_0_179736.wav	Now, we have to prove that if you exchange value of, sorry, the location of I and E the values of current I is not going to change	test
audio_0_121061.wav	So, again we can substitute you get f of e is 0	test
audio_0_133606.wav	And therefore, the compiler cannot resolve	test
audio_0_184163.wav	So, these resistances they do not come into picture at all	test
audio_0_34056.wav	So, you can open three single quotes, and then you can write whatever you want with multiple double quotes and single quotes	test
audio_0_3478.wav	So, this is v should be is equal to m into T right and your m is equal to nothing but this is your slope v is equal to V m upon T by 4; that means, somewhere I am writing ah	test
audio_0_105542.wav	Ah if you do not remember do not worry that is why I am kind of repeating the things that you have already been studying in the theory class	test
audio_0_200075.wav	And this other input of the op amp I call it VD 0	test
audio_0_137029.wav	But, in swap we need the changes in the formal parameter to come back to the actual parameter	test
audio_0_133009.wav	So, I have given the name of that as my n s	test
audio_0_7518.wav	Because anything that v t is given and find the current your 5 milli ampere if the voltage across because, v t is 0 for t less than 0 right, so your in this case your i t 0 is equal to 0	test
audio_0_164991.wav	Between the shareholders also, there are many groups	test
audio_0_195483.wav	So I would definitely have only e1 available across the primary winding which will be instrumental in inducing a secondary EMF of e2	test
audio_0_184677.wav	So, we know that ammeters are connected in series	test
audio_0_163885.wav	It is the long term borrowings divided by the shareholders fund, debt was 0	test
audio_0_179550.wav	Now, in case of time shift, if the function is like f t minus a and multiplied by unit function, unit is step function, that is time shifted by a, then your Laplace transform would be e to the power minus a s into F s that is the Laplace Transform of Function f t	test
audio_0_196474.wav	For short circuit characteristic I have to see where may be Ia rated is been reached at what IF	test
audio_0_213003.wav	We may have to provide certain additional features for that, ok	test
audio_0_207942.wav	If it is angular information we usually represent it in terms of angles	test
audio_0_51372.wav	How do I compute without solving the system of equations first and once I solve it with a inexact boundary I do not know I mean what I have got is everything put together reflections everything put together	test
audio_0_40165.wav	outward surface	test
audio_0_113521.wav	And in this case what will happen	test
audio_0_137234.wav	Because, like the static data member is static member function is also not associated with any object, it is just associated with the class since it is not associated with an object, it does not have the objects address of the this pointer	test
audio_0_68407.wav	so c internal will also go through charging, discharging	test
audio_0_146306.wav	But in the conditional variety, the second compare instruction also you can make conditional	test
audio_0_124675.wav	Now we saw that when we have multi section transformers, both for the binomial or the Chebyshev polynomials that we have considered the bandwidth increases when we increased the section that is the general trend that we saw	test
audio_0_191767.wav	If you are talking about of hundreds of kilo watt, we may call that as high capacity right We are not talking about fractional kilo watt at all hardly ever 3 phase machines are used for fractional kilo watts	test
audio_0_112057.wav	And then because of the virtual ground concept we have difference voltage zero	test
audio_0_136496.wav	When an object has pointers that is referring to other objects that are dynamically created, then while copying it, if we just copy the pointer, but do not copy the object, then we say that we are doing a shallow copy, but in contrast while copying the object, if we do not copy the pointer, but you copy the pointed object, then will say that we have done a deep copy	test
audio_0_209431.wav	For first quadrant system the bottom plane always be opaque plane similarly, the back side is also opaque	test
audio_0_24939.wav	0125 tPkg so this is 1 minus 0	test
audio_0_199400.wav	Now this VX could be negative but it cannot be more negative than one threshold voltage	test
audio_0_119422.wav	For simplicity let us just call these a, b and c	test
audio_0_214496.wav	So, semicircle is constructed	test
audio_0_148219.wav	I think I have already motivated you like why do we need object tracking, but let me give you some more examples, where you will see that just tracking the object may not make sense	test
audio_0_190493.wav	We are saying ok that is some electrical energy input	test
audio_0_44193.wav	So, if you notice our equation over here	test
audio_0_100884.wav	As you start filling the flat jack, the flat jack starts exerting pressure against the masonry and as this pressure increases you decide at what resolution you are going to start taking measurements	test
audio_0_192570.wav	Let me write here this is R2 dash by 2 S, this is X2 dash by 2 which means this voltage is going to be corresponding to EF or forward revolving magnetic field dependent induced EMF	test
audio_0_178821.wav	So, this you have got, now you can put the value of V 1 in the above equation so you can also get the I 1 in terms of V naught so that is minus 0	test
audio_0_6086.wav	So, this is your what you call minus 2 ampere	test
audio_0_82860.wav	119,200 is the cost of the raw material consumed because we had the total cost of purchase and opening stock, 1,141,440	test
audio_0_104656.wav	In a certain oscillator circuit, the gain is given and the feedback is given, verify Barkhausen criterion for sustained oscillation	test
audio_0_176779.wav	Now if you are taking convolution of f with unit step the output would be minus infinity to t , f lambda t lambda because for lambda greater than t the unit step would be zero so that is why the value of lambda up to t is the upper integral component for the convolution of f with unit step function	test
audio_0_71834.wav	so exactly at the point where the edge occurs, whatever is the input value, that will be taken and the corresponding value will get stored	test
audio_0_210239.wav	In isometric projections first of all we have to construct this isometric axis where lengths can be measured on true scale basis	test
audio_0_51204.wav	So, I have to compensate for this segments among because the integral is from minus a to b	test
audio_0_4390.wav	So, in general, in general this is the circuit here in general	test
audio_0_3540.wav	You have to put and you have to solve for m and c no need	test
audio_0_32674.wav	So, as a result of this re computation of the same value again and again, though we in principle only need n minus 1 sub problems	test
audio_0_10897.wav	So, this is at some angle theta and this is your center, this is the center right and it is revolving	test
audio_0_172200.wav	Because the graph what we are creating is describing the topological properties of the network	test
audio_0_213880.wav	But in this problem what we have is; we have this line, we have this line if I am keeping this one Q, point P and T we know	test
audio_0_162423.wav	15 and 53	test
audio_0_134306.wav	So, this kind of you know pitfalls make macros quite unusable and we lead to what is known as templates	test
audio_0_112349.wav	We see another multimeter, again in multimeter there are probes these are called probes right	test
audio_0_169360.wav	Head nod suggest a particular sense of likability or its absence	test
audio_0_57693.wav	you observe this electric field because the bulb lights up	test
audio_0_203276.wav	It is not that for this particular simple circuit this happened to be the case	test
audio_0_3011.wav	So, figure 28 a shows a voltage source v 0 u t and it is equivalent circuit is shown	test
audio_0_212062.wav	If we draw perpendicular V B is equal to V F	test
audio_0_49705.wav	So, now let us come to the different so called regimes	test
audio_0_85202.wav	We could get 15 semi skilled less workers and to compensate for that we have to increase the number of the unskilled from the 60 to 80	test
audio_0_208765.wav	So, we go ahead mark these end points this supposed to be 200 mm, then vertically we have to go by 50 mm	test
audio_0_190901.wav	And we are assuming that the currents are perfectly sinusoidal	test
audio_0_143788.wav	Now, you could also say products, you could say a merchandise, but largely this comprises and that is the reason we have the GST tax; that is goods and services tax because, the goods and services is understood to encompass everything, that can be a part of trade	test
audio_0_35530.wav	So, this does not work, right	test
audio_0_177378.wav	You will write sine a cos b plus cos b, right	test
audio_0_2475.wav	Similarly, similarly you add equation your add equation 3 equation 3 and equation 4 already equation 3 equation 4 we have got it	test
audio_0_95076.wav	In other words, we can say that discount rate is defined as the annual rate by which the discount by which we discount the future earnings mathematically	test
audio_0_78223.wav	I gave you the example of A, B, C, C, D, E, you are manufacturing five products or you can manufacture five products	test
audio_0_6967.wav	And you solve equations 1 and 2 you solve because only 2 are known v 1 and v 2 if you solve you will get v 1 us equal to your what you call this 50 volt right v 2 is equal to 30 volt and i 1 is v 1 by 5	test
audio_0_181109.wav	So, for a normal comparator ok	test
audio_0_168406.wav	Because they have developed a particular association unconsciously	test
audio_0_13753.wav	So, no current is here also here also it is going 0 current because i s c here it is 0 it is dependent source here it is 0	test
audio_0_198559.wav	And N is how many slots are allocated per pole per phase	test
audio_0_3424.wav	So, anyway, that is why that is why ah, that is why 1 dash line is shown here right and another thing is that ah for this one	test
audio_0_163825.wav	Here the capital does not refer only to equity but the total capital employed	test
audio_0_163227.wav	The type of analysis which we are doing in portfolio management parlance, this is known as fundamental analysis	test
audio_0_145761.wav	We'll see those things in a few minutes	test
audio_0_115520.wav	When the malloc from this thread gets invoked for the 1st time what would happen is that the ptmalloc code would determining that this is a new thread and is the 1st invocation to malloc from that thread and therefore it will request the operating system to issue another 132 kilobytes of memory	test
audio_0_210079.wav	So, call this one C then from C, D goes parallel to our A B line, transfer C to D length, which is 50 units here	test
audio_0_5519.wav	So, if generally any source any current flow through the short circuit, it will not go to any your what you call any other electrical element	test
audio_0_211189.wav	Another thing, another important feature that we generally use this coincidental mate is to fix the origins	test
audio_0_103061.wav	Okay, so this is the average compression in the masonry that we can define	test
audio_0_208776.wav	So, this is out of paper	test
audio_0_203483.wav	So you choose R1 and R2 such that R1 parallel R2 is much more than RS	test
audio_0_196541.wav	Because, the flux gets minimized tremendously under short circuit condition, essentially even the voltage generated somewhat is compromised, the voltage generated also becomes compromised	test
audio_0_201149.wav	I will redraw the circuit here	test
audio_0_160347.wav	So, we had come up to this net working capital to sales ratio and we had seen that the movement is really very interesting from plus 8% to minus 32%	test
audio_0_174902.wav	You can write Zth is nothing but that is Rth plus j Xth	test
audio_0_124203.wav	So, such a situation actually exists, for example, if 2 networks are connected in series or in shunt, then actually, we just discussed it that Z and Y parameters might actually be more convenient than S parameters	test
audio_0_80309.wav	So, difference is in the 1 case we are receiving the material, in the other case we are sending the material	test
audio_0_125372.wav	So, these are some of the 2 port devices that are commonly used, of course as I said, filters are also examples of 2 port devices but we shall cover them in a separate module	test
audio_0_18762.wav	So these blind men, this is from an old Indian folklore so to speak, 5 men blind men were moved on to an elephant	test
audio_0_55445.wav	Another exercise which I have included is this	test
audio_0_18498.wav	Then note taking application	test
audio_0_145937.wav	This you should remember; that means, the response time is not of the order of microseconds or very lower milliseconds	test
audio_0_106606.wav	The point is once I finish the whole series, I hope that you would be able to understand how we can fabricate that single MOSFET right	test
audio_0_151174.wav	Time is 5	test
audio_0_163491.wav	So, which are the assets which are subject to exhaustion	test
audio_0_120372.wav	In part c, we want to calculate the depletion width on the p and the n side	test
audio_0_54380.wav	So you can do some documentation with that	test
audio_0_58376.wav	now, this is a very simple, because p x means there is a surface charge, there is no bulk charged, but the surface charge sigma is p dot s, because s n, which is p cosine of phi	test
audio_0_42196.wav	So, then what would happen is that you would simply have this equation would become epsilon E dot is equal to curl of H correct and that is how we deal with in any Yee cell I assign the permittivity to be epsilon 1, epsilon 2 whatever right	test
audio_0_124815.wav	So if you see if gamma l is equal to 0 then gamma in reduces to S 1 1	test
audio_0_117036.wav	The mov instruction moves the contents of edx register plus 64 bytes into the eax register	test
audio_0_205471.wav	On which we start saying the threads	test
audio_0_185082.wav	And this chapter is going to be on Ammeters, voltmeters and oeters	test
audio_0_54471.wav	One of the most popular Buck Boost derived converter is the flyback converter which is very very popular and you will see it in most of the commercial power supplies	test
audio_0_135784.wav	It will simply not take will not be able take cognizance of the extended part of B, but it will get valid A object which is the base part of the B object and will just give you that object	test
audio_0_86249.wav	as you keep on etching out the surface, the resultant stuff will be like this: you will have an array of [mit/micro], micro cantilever which will be etched out from the surface, of course with a certain amount of depth profile which will be how there	test
audio_0_49262.wav	Now #a, if I want to write	test
audio_0_182713.wav	So, how will the display	test
audio_0_15300.wav	That means this side that means, this side voltage transformation it will be K into V 2 because it is ideal transfer this trans ratio is N 1 this is N 2 E 1 upon E 2 is equal to N 1 upon N 2 that is your E 1 upon E 2 is equal to your N 1 upon N 2, right	test
audio_0_73996.wav	So, it means in this case these three components one is the material then is the labor and then we have the direct expenses, these are the direct cost components	test
audio_0_49245.wav	So, the local edge number is T is 1 in green right	test
audio_0_125257.wav	Similarly say if I want to implement an open termination, an open termination or simply an open	test
audio_0_115589.wav	Therefore, we would corresponding to the fast bin of 16 bytes we would have the chunk x that gets allocated	test
audio_0_201133.wav	So this has to get connected to ground for signals	test
audio_0_169504.wav	It may also result from the acute awareness of ones social position where you want to look down upon somebody and therefore, you do not want to shake hands with the other person	test
audio_0_177400.wav	Now you can easily compare this with VM cos omega T plus 5	test
audio_0_41299.wav	So, 1D medium so, very simply I will take the two Maxwell’s equations take curl of the other and get a wave equation and this wave equation that I get is off this kind over here the only change that happens is that instead of k naught squared I get an epsilon r prime whatever was the relative permittivity over there comes in over here ok	test
audio_0_2727.wav	So, this is figure 20 one and if you do so, if you do so, this angle is 30 degree right and your V an, your what you call V an is nothing, but your V p V bn also V p we solved that here what we call all these magnitude	test
audio_0_81428.wav	It includes the operating budgets that how much production we are going to do	test
audio_0_48728.wav	Linear operator	test
audio_0_16119.wav	So, V and V because this this is your nothing is there this is a common node	test
audio_0_103141.wav	So, if you recall we will, we had this table where there are two parts to the table when you design, when you design considering the masonry to take care of the shear or you design such that the reinforcement takes care of the shear coming onto the wall	test
audio_0_47728.wav	So, they have a you know the width of the waveguide radius all of these have been specified	test
audio_0_5811.wav	Then two loops are there, if one loop is carrying that your what you call that time varying current, and another loop that some flux will be it will links some flux to the other coil right, and they are said to be actually magnetically coupled	test
audio_0_177045.wav	It means that i1R1 equal to i2R2, so from here you can find out the value of i2 that is nothing but i1R1 by R2	test
audio_0_126860.wav	And the current IZ is equal to the difference of 2 waves and the Zo is a constant, it is a constant for a lossless line but for a lossy line, it is equal to this equation	test
audio_0_115727.wav	So, what an ROP attack actually does, is that it replaces this return to main and starts filling in gadgets over here	test
audio_0_7330.wav	So, equation 77 actually give the step response of the R L circuit with I 0 is equal to 0	test
audio_0_42565.wav	I mean the hint is that I would have drawn three boxes	test
audio_0_146016.wav	And then you select NucleoF401RE; this is the board that we are using	test
audio_0_45056.wav	So, if this is a solution, this is also a solution right	test
audio_0_40678.wav	Whatever is happening at alpha has more influence on this because the way the shape function corresponding to this becomes 0 by the time you come over here, similarly whatever is happening over here has no influence on this	test
audio_0_49823.wav	So, the first operator is the divergence	test
audio_0_159018.wav	Last time also I had told but once again I am reminding here it is expected that you sit with the printout, take that particular sheet and try to solve the case along with me, then prepare the balance sheet in your own notebook and check with the balance sheet as shown in the video	test
audio_0_73147.wav	so what is the maximum difference in the delays between any pair of i and j	test
audio_0_53852.wav	So we could have a BJT something like this, PNP based	test
audio_0_71692.wav	lets assume their all of equal size, means they take equal times	test
audio_0_203587.wav	Nothing goes into the op amp	test
audio_0_171233.wav	In this particular video, we find that cultural variations in certain aspects of our behavior which was earlier considered to be universal are displayed in an interesting fashion	test
audio_0_70504.wav	one fault will be a, stuck at one, for which the inputs will be one one and the output will also become one	test
audio_0_85533.wav	He imported in millions of units from Taiwan	test
audio_0_209084.wav	The intersection of this vertical and two others would be at lower front corner of a block with square corners we will see	test
audio_0_48271.wav	Basis yeah so basis functions may be unrealistic like using a pulse basis function may be unrealistic, but using you know a triangular basis function may be better right	test
audio_0_134780.wav	So, if it is minus 1 then we designate that the stack is empty	test
audio_0_174367.wav	This, we will discuss in the next session where we will see what do we mean by the convolution integral and how it can help in finding out the output response of a circuit where we know the input impulse response of the network	test
audio_0_163998.wav	Just have a look once again	test
audio_0_204134.wav	So, this is the incremental part	test
audio_0_206687.wav	If we do that b will be visible it goes and from b there is a line which goes and joins the top apex that one will be this one	test
audio_0_127676.wav	We had zone 2 which was corroding a lot	test
audio_0_148769.wav	Over emphasis, over gratification of one of these three structures is going to cause severe problem	test
audio_0_35017.wav	We never bother about where the space is coming from or where it is going	test
audio_0_173481.wav	What is the theorem	test
audio_0_123640.wav	The next thing I like to do is, in last class we never calculated the position of the fermi energy	test
audio_0_16836.wav	This is what you call, if you to take the derivative of this one that i is equal to dq by dt	test
audio_0_111962.wav	That is to null my output voltage, typically if you come back on the screen what you will see, typically the value is 2 millivolts, and the maximum the value is 6 millivolts	test
audio_0_191044.wav	So we cannot use a normal ferromagnetic core for these kinds of transformers which are working at kilo hertz frequency, right	test
audio_0_168744.wav	In the context of the business world sometimes we find that too much of an emphasis on monochronic perspective can backfire in a multicultural setting because the idea that sometimes it may take years to develop a loyal customer base is not understood by such people	test
audio_0_186102.wav	So, then V P will be equal to 10 volt, this is 5, this is 15, this will be average 10 volt	test
audio_0_11303.wav	So, if you consider this part	test
audio_0_46510.wav	So, this is your this is just the definition of FEM take your waiting function, take your residual integrate	test
audio_0_141602.wav	So, if you think about a physical phone, you have a options for doing all of these interface activities on the keyboard or the graphics display, your touch screen, the phone, but do you really see any functionality where you can set the last dial number, you do not because you are not supposed to do that	test
audio_0_37915.wav	I think even when we were kids being introvert was ok	test
audio_0_64401.wav	or this, so this second bit becomes zero	test
audio_0_5469.wav	So, here also same thing we have to find out your V Thevenin and R Thevenin one dependent voltage source is there this is i x, current is here is i x this this i x is here right	test
audio_0_42480.wav	The first term will be del by del there is a minus sign right	test
audio_0_136266.wav	But, still your results will become unpredictable	test
audio_0_39998.wav	f of z naught cancels off right and then I am left with delta z by 2 is common and its their 2 times right	test
audio_0_113408.wav	And we already know n channel enhancement type structure as a P type substrate right is the substrate and then you have source, you have drain, it can be like this it can be in in a different way also the same the same thing does not matter it does not matter whether you consider this is source you consider this drain that does not matter ok	test
audio_0_11277.wav	Therefore, this is my Z we got	test
audio_0_118194.wav	So, metals are so much more conductive	test
audio_0_194778.wav	So this is going to be let us say e,right	test
audio_0_52349.wav	So, there is a phi 1 here and there is a phi 2 here, the 2 on the boundary are the same because continuity of tangential equations right	test
audio_0_35199.wav	We cannot talk about privacy in terms of implementations or objects and so on	test
audio_0_200068.wav	Now if two nodes are shorted to each other, obviously they will be at the same voltage	test
audio_0_42828.wav	So, this whole term is remember that we cannot actually do any analytically evaluation of this integral	test
audio_0_99972.wav	It is a perforated unit and you can see that it's cored	test
audio_0_2313.wav	So, from equation one you please solve this one you please solve this one for your l	test
audio_0_63395.wav	i have another register, lets say ri plus one	test
audio_0_50514.wav	This is not while yeah this is you can call it susceptibility yeah which is going to be also written in n is equal to 1 to N right	test
audio_0_175548.wav	Now, properties of the Laplace transform and the Laplace transform of basic common functions were discussed in the previous classes	test
audio_0_70566.wav	so one of the main objectives of placement may be to reduce the overall wire length, because one intuitive argument you can give that if i minimize the overall wire length it is expected that the performance of my circuit will also improve	test
audio_0_34685.wav	So, we say list1 is 1, 3, 5, 7 list2 is also 1, 3, 5, 7 and list3 is list2	test
audio_0_42401.wav	So, question so, if you look at the way we derived this	test
audio_0_108224.wav	Is it correct	test
audio_0_46786.wav	So, in terms of a circuit model, how can I think of this	test
audio_0_113637.wav	Nature of the output waveform parameters used a range of frequencies etcetera	test
audio_0_45630.wav	We could put it at the middle of the cell, but then the problem is boundary conditions enforcing	test
audio_0_201078.wav	And this type of biasing naturally is known as source feedback bias	test
audio_0_46194.wav	So, I have not actually solved the problem, I have just converted it into a form that is easier to look at	test
audio_0_126628.wav	We want that the total power consumed by our transistor is very less	test
audio_0_109015.wav	So, I will have 8	test
audio_0_163119.wav	One is borrowing's long term and one is only borrowings	test
audio_0_118216.wav	So, you can have s p 3, s p 2, s p hybridizations	test
audio_0_194756.wav	Now these 2 are connected together you can very well see that they are connected in series,right	test
audio_0_204711.wav	Whenever you have available long dimensions, we show it like over that	test
audio_0_52378.wav	r un primed coordinates right that is that is indicated over here	test
audio_0_125610.wav	Now, the Smith charts are commercially available, they can be downloaded from the Internet	test
audio_0_34066.wav	If we say t is equal to say just the letter x, then the type of t is also a string	test
audio_0_171301.wav	In fact, it can be said that a direct and positive eye contact can often make the difference between one selection or rejection	test
audio_0_65672.wav	so in the next week we shall be starting our discussion on the timing analysis, the various ways you can carry out timing analysis, static timing analysis and ways in which you can annotate or modify a design so that they perform better with respect to timing	test
audio_0_196723.wav	So, this is slip ring or wound rotor, whereas this is squirrel cage rotor okay	test
audio_0_66259.wav	what are the other three dimensions	test
audio_0_127161.wav	And that makes it sometimes inconvenient because we would prefer to have uniform aa characteristic impedance and also uniform with	test
audio_0_105313.wav	So, now we have here three operational amplifiers; 1, 2, and 3 right because in our circuit also we had three OP Amps right	test
audio_0_73410.wav	let here i am giving an example again	test
audio_0_212430.wav	So, this is the top view that has to make 45 degrees inclined to the vertical plane	test
audio_0_105936.wav	Input was a square wave and the output was a triangular wave	test
audio_0_148488.wav	But on the other side if it is greater than, I am not changing, the next bit I am changing to 1, and this process repeats	test
audio_0_78034.wav	So, this is the process how we prepare the cost sheet	test
audio_0_51141.wav	So, how do you again same problem I want to you know send a beam here, but not that all of those things	test
audio_0_102601.wav	What's the shear force, axial force interaction for a given masonry wall for different levels of axial force acting on the wall	test
audio_0_71877.wav	so ah, for n type mos transistor, for example sorry for a n type transistor if c equal to one, which means the transistor t is on, which means it conducts	test
audio_0_168799.wav	It is very common in certain societies as well as in certain organizations to make the subordinates wait for the appointments so that they can internalize the significance and importance or the higher rank of their superior	test
audio_0_210672.wav	Let us look at that a parabola has to be constructed with a rectangle size of 140 mm by 100 mm	test
audio_0_140265.wav	So, this p s array if I just use a different color, say this particular one is a function pointer, because p s array is this array	test
audio_0_170625.wav	It can be symbol which denotes that everything is all right, it may also suggest that it is zero	test
audio_0_211655.wav	Once it is done with F 1 as centre; so, F 1 is centre the distance from A to 1, this distance let us measure it with that distance from F 1 make an arc something like that on both the sides	test
audio_0_199546.wav	And just for comparison I will show the single port or a 2 terminal non linearity here, we have a single voltage and a current	test
audio_0_65593.wav	so i needed another layer and i need wire connection	test
audio_0_52137.wav	So, in our FDTD simulation let us for now forget PML and all that right	test
audio_0_35643.wav	It just keep this in mind every python function, every python class, if you want to use a function in the object oriented style, the first argument must necessarily be self and then the real arguments	test
audio_0_125016.wav	What happens is when z2 is very close to z1 then this gamma21 is small & so this expression, gamma L & gamma21 magnitude, will be even smaller because gamma L is either 1 or lesser than	test
audio_0_45237.wav	It will go everywhere and why depending on the shape of the object	test
audio_0_14656.wav	So, minus sign so, minus j 2 mutual your reactance is j 2 minus j 2 into i 1 plus i 2	test
audio_0_43523.wav	So, we practically speaking when you think of antennas radar cross section of antennas you know the issue of charge is sitting out there is not very relevant ok	test
audio_0_134858.wav	So it must have a prototype included in the scope of the class and must be prefixed with friend, we have just in the example of the display function as to how do you write the signature of that function within the class with a friend in the front to say that this particular function is a friend of this class	test
audio_0_64138.wav	so this is the model of the sequential circuit that i showed just now: that you have a combinational logic where the primary inputs and primary outputs are coming and going	test
audio_0_180625.wav	Now, how to remember this you just remember only one circuit difference amplifier, how to remember, remember this rule NOPG	test
audio_0_55987.wav	does it mean that electric field is only in that wire or does it exist everywhere	test
audio_0_139414.wav	There some additional noting have made here, which is a immediately not very important, but you can note that since this is a private member of the base class, private member cannot be access from outside	test
audio_0_111678.wav	Ist isit 90 degree	test
audio_0_61099.wav	let us see one medium on one side has permittivity epsilon one	test
audio_0_111284.wav	All of us have done basic electronics project in our undergrad studies, where we have done soldering	test
audio_0_170665.wav	And therefore, effective displays help us to avoid friction in a particular situation and this is there significant role	test
audio_0_120738.wav	So, your bonding orbital has a lower energy that is your sigma, anti bonding orbital has a higher energy that is sigma star	test
audio_0_104469.wav	No input signal is needed to start the oscillation	test
audio_0_185041.wav	So, these two are the terminals of the meter through which the unknown current I should entered and leave	test
audio_0_19095.wav	So it does not actually start from 0 to 200 kilometre or whatever speed it is going at, at that moment but it is already at a rotating speed so the tyre ware is minimal	test
audio_0_141422.wav	This virtual function will get delegated because manager classes over did in this function with the logic of how to compute manager salary and this will correctly invoke the process salary of the manager	test
audio_0_105491.wav	And what are the process flow, the op amp is fabricated on tiny silicon chip, right	test
audio_0_47476.wav	Let us see what a 2 point Gauss quadrature rule gives us	test
audio_0_122622.wav	So, these defect states can essentially modify the electronic properties	test
audio_0_100188.wav	It could be a flexure dominated mechanism, it could be a shear dominated mechanism	test
audio_0_114843.wav	Notice that a mylib int is used in exactly two locations, one is at this point over here in function setmylib int and the second one is at this location getmylib int	test
audio_0_172233.wav	Sub graph of a given graph is formed by removing branches from the original graph	test
audio_0_108233.wav	So, for now, let us quickly recall what we have seen we have seen inverting amplifier, we have applied the input at a inverting amplifier, we measure the output from that output, V out by V in, we have measured the gain, right	test
audio_0_150443.wav	Large number of employees in given organization, you want to identify who are the people who should be transferred to RND section, who are the people who are who can be sent negotiate which are the other agencies, who are the people who would be very very reluctant to these changes, who are the people who would be extremely balanced if they are given certain critical tasks; you can use big 5	test
audio_0_139942.wav	Private access is for the members of the class, public access is for everybody	test
audio_0_211103.wav	In next classes, we will learn about more options available at Solidworks	test
audio_0_130285.wav	So, with that, as the reaction proceeds, you see reaction of Ye'elimite, right	test
audio_0_110606.wav	We can increase the band width we can increase the bandwidth	test
audio_0_100135.wav	So, you see that how the different lengths of rigid offsets is then used to ensure your total frame along the height is modeled as an equivalent frame	test
audio_0_108040.wav	Now given that you are have, R 1 equals to 1 kilo ohm this one, right	test
audio_0_43524.wav	All of those charges once they start moving they become currents and we already dealing with currents	test
audio_0_40067.wav	Nothing special about Maxwell’s equations right	test
audio_0_5843.wav	And we are trying to find out the mutual inductance M 2 1 that is that is this one M 2 1	test
audio_0_206893.wav	So, fix this X1 point and rotate it so that we will be in a position to see that	test
audio_0_86932.wav	so the plating rule was, or e is you plate the muscle first and wait for one to two hours and then add the motor neuron	test
audio_0_70669.wav	so if you take the manhattan distance, the wire length will be simple, this, but for a general multi terminal nets, how to estimate	test
audio_0_190555.wav	You will look at it that way	test
audio_0_36747.wav	Likewise if we define d to be an empty dictionary then we can use a function such as d dot values to get the list of values currently stored, but we cannot manipulate d as a list	test
audio_0_108649.wav	How non inverting amplifier operates	test
audio_0_190499.wav	Where as in this particular case we have considered two magnetization characteristics	test
audio_0_206539.wav	If I want to delete everything in this Sketch mode what I can do is, use your left click button, hold it; hold it mean press continuously without releasing then select the object, then it select everything, then you can delete	test
audio_0_48354.wav	So, may as well and put the source here and observation over here ok, it is a symmetric situation over here	test
audio_0_18481.wav	So I think that should be the first step	test
audio_0_108564.wav	Now we are connecting this to the power supply, and we have switch on the power supply	test
audio_0_13714.wav	So, we have here we have to obtain the Norton equivalent circuit	test
audio_0_30251.wav	so its failure may occur in this way	test
audio_0_191685.wav	So, I should be able to write some of the equations electrical equations based on whatever characteristics I have drawn, I can say Vt is equal to Eg minus Ia Ra, right	test
audio_0_190425.wav	So we are looking at the two endpoints and then we are trying to see how much of mechanical work has been done	test
audio_0_150378.wav	What was the need for that	test
audio_0_163013.wav	So, increase in the inventory will it increase the expense or reduce the expense	test
audio_0_82673.wav	If the tax information is also given, then we work out the net profit before tax and after that we treat the tax, adjust the tax and we work out the final profit which is called as the net profit after tax	test
audio_0_38356.wav	The other person may gets stuck as we were talking about the memory keeps haunting you and then it may lead to whatever else like it happened in Mahabharat; a small land piece he would Duryodhana would have given, but it did not happen	test
audio_0_113498.wav	So, VGS VG minus VGS plus VDS equals to VD	test
audio_0_38310.wav	That quantification may be different, it may have less or more or like people who suffered in people who fought in partition in the partition of India; people killed, they got killed	test
audio_0_17124.wav	So, this is a correction right	test
audio_0_117951.wav	So this particular figure over here shows how the refreshing occurs, so refreshing typically occurs periodically in a DRAM structure, so these particular areas is where the DRAM is inaccessible due to the refreshing period where the capacitors are recharged, while the accessible regions in the DRAM is over here	test
audio_0_10828.wav	47 angle 59	test
audio_0_117190.wav	So, for example if we have this memory controller what we could possibly do is if your input is 5 you EX OR it with a certain specific key and obtain a value of 8	test
audio_0_58012.wav	so we know just e equals to q naught e to the power minus tau y r c pi a square epsilon naught	test
audio_0_215408.wav	These are some of the technological literacy concepts that we need to keep in mind while designing learning activities in e learning	test
audio_0_194437.wav	Now, if I am having 1 inductance probably let us say L di by dt equal to VL, voltage across the inductance, lets say I am going to have i equal to some Im sin omega t, right	test
audio_0_43951.wav	So, once I read in these things I mean what would I read in to	test
audio_0_125358.wav	Now, in the book by Pozart, solution for this implementation is given	test
audio_0_57892.wav	that's very easy to see, because z is nothing but cosine of theta r minus sine of theta	test
audio_0_102818.wav	3 meters in length and hence we expect the response, lateral load response of this wall to be basically governed by shear deformations	test
audio_0_192541.wav	That means the copper losses are going to be high, which means efficiency will be low	test
audio_0_207189.wav	Let us just align these wheels to this rail track; I will make it mate	test
audio_0_147630.wav	If the switch is not pressed, the output point will be high, if the switch is pressed it will be low; it will be connected to ground	test
audio_0_179617.wav	So, this will become k1 into e to the power minus p1t and similarly, for other times also you can find out the inverse Laplace transform	test
audio_0_36756.wav	Our question is, that instead of using the built in list for stacks, queues and heaps and other data structures can we also defined a data type in which certain operations are permitted according to the type that we start with	test
audio_0_36588.wav	If on the other hand it did, what we would perhaps think is more natural and it will do i, i plus 1 up to j, if this were the case then every time when we wanted to actually range over the list positions, we would have to go from 0 to length of l minus 1	test
audio_0_129727.wav	Traditionally people used what is called a front loading technique	test
audio_0_119766.wav	The corresponding current Im is 0	test
audio_0_4458.wav	4 degree volt	test
audio_0_131676.wav	So designers seem to be quite a bit interested in this and we will see, of course the challenge is, we have only done this in the lab menu and to do it for concrete, we are going large, you know even though 0	test
audio_0_111657.wav	33 microseconds	test
audio_0_33781.wav	So, inside each node we have 2 attributes value and next as we said and remember that self is always used with every function to denote the object under consideration	test
audio_0_35406.wav	So, we just add an extra clause which says paths(i, j) is 0 if there is a hole at (i,j); otherwise we use exactly the same inductive formulation and now what happens is, if I have a hole below me, if I have a hole below me, no paths can come from that direction because by definition paths(i, j) at that point is 0	test
audio_0_179890.wav	we are simply removing means, removing means your short circuiting the voltage source and leaving the current source as it is	test

audio_0_106492.wav	So, there is a chemical here which is called photoresist developer	test
audio_0_46340.wav	Now, what remains is to calculate this integral and the integrand is a polynomial in general	test
audio_0_7465.wav	However the voltage across an inductor can change abruptly, next 1 is an ideal inductor does not dissipate energy right	test
audio_0_141818.wav	So, we use these words interchangeably a research if research needs to be commercialized, then the technology developed in the university has to go to the market or to the industry players	test
audio_0_51013.wav	So, the approximation made is approximate your circle sorry your square by a circle of the same area	test
audio_0_162463.wav	In the first session we had seen the purposes of each of these statements	test
audio_0_12613.wav	So, it is minus t 0, if you take the this side negative will come, but distance is 1 minus t 0 minus your t 0 plus 1 right	test
audio_0_203307.wav	Now you see why this method is easier, we don't even need to write the nonlinear equations of the original circuit	test
audio_0_174252.wav	So, an nth order differential equation can be decomposed into n first order differential equations	test
audio_0_112756.wav	We will see how you can deposit dielectrics or semiconductors right using physical evaluation	test
audio_0_74550.wav	So, what is the particulars here	test
audio_0_16294.wav	So, it is approximately 6 ampere	test
audio_0_49430.wav	So, I cannot simplify this, so what would do you in this case	test
audio_0_100970.wav	This is, it requires a lot of gymnastics in the site but it is something that is feasible and particularly when you are working on existing buildings, seismic assessment of such buildings where you have sacrificial walls where walls are actually going to be torn down because of alterations being made or because of heavy damage a building is going to be pulled down then that presents you a wonderful opportunity to actually execute such a test because it gives very valuable in situ information of sheer strength of masonry	test
audio_0_212966.wav	Similarly, you want to increase that size use these two buttons together, you press them together so that it enlarges or change the size	test
audio_0_183737.wav	So, now if we change theta the phase angle of E will change ok	test
audio_0_177673.wav	Now, if you write kvl around this particular loop where we are assuming that current I is flowing in this particular loop	test
audio_0_181592.wav	So, now this is what, this is nothing but the input impedance, this is the input impedance; input voltage by input current input impedance, this is equal to 2 R 1 ok	test
audio_0_79959.wav	So, for that you don't have the budgets because you have only static budget for one level	test
audio_0_11186.wav	But in the laboratory right that generally we will perform that this one on LV side your what you call the supplier that youryour open circuit test, you perform on the LV side andnot on the high voltage side right	test
audio_0_124543.wav	Let us see a simple MOSFET which is an active device and has some noise associated with it	test
audio_0_145237.wav	Student: Then the medical therapy is all process of procedures can be protected to mutual properties	test
audio_0_7244.wav	For source the circuit, we have seen that and this is actually we call forced response that is some that is the due to that external force, that is your nothing but that your voltage source, right	test
audio_0_42022.wav	So, of the two terms that come on the right hand side one remains, which has a known information and the rest goes back right	test
audio_0_146204.wav	So, the next instruction will be from somewhere else	test
audio_0_137296.wav	Similarly, you can again do a print of 20	test
audio_0_34989.wav	So, we build this heap now we said that the delete max will remove the element at the top because that is the root, but it will also create a vacancy here, this is the value that will go to the top, this is the last leaf which will go the top when we fix the delete max	test
audio_0_10335.wav	This is your Z y is given, and V ab is also given	test
audio_0_55901.wav	how about theta unit vector	test
audio_0_136606.wav	So, this is the initial one, it is initialized with 4	test
audio_0_8415.wav	So, this is understandable right instead of L 1 I make reactance and and this current i	test
audio_0_170782.wav	Silence can be understood as a vocal absence of words or any associated voice yet the way the silence represents our meanings is very subtle and yet it is resonant	test
audio_0_152800.wav	So, better not a suitable for this course at least right, some just some general ideas right, but the length of a typical damper is about 60 centimeter and weighs about 5 kg or more	test
audio_0_203883.wav	Now, this GM is nothing but the partial derivative of ID with respect to VGS	test
audio_0_63393.wav	so we have a scenario like this	test
audio_0_182190.wav	So, this is the current	test
audio_0_151062.wav	So, l is equal to 2s, s small 2 into small s this is equation 50	test
audio_0_107447.wav	So, the data sheet when we say it will show you the Ib value, which is nothing, but Ib1 plus Ib2 by 2 right	test
audio_0_135905.wav	But if I invoke the methods through functions or through reference then I may have static or dynamic binding depending on whether the member function I am invoking is a non virtual one where the static binding will happen or when the member function is a virtual one where dynamic binding will happen	test
audio_0_40219.wav	So, I am going to call this phi i what should it will be a function of r or r prime	test
audio_0_170755.wav	Within ritual contexts, food often stands in its expressions of life, love, happiness and grief	test
audio_0_48677.wav	Exactly he has a right idea right	test
audio_0_64922.wav	so after small delay, d is changing from one to zero	test
audio_0_45286.wav	Typically you are we want to know what is the overall behavior	test
audio_0_76773.wav	Other disbursements are now wages and salaries	test
audio_0_160628.wav	And Enron is a very striking case because Enron was a very big donor to both the major parties in US	test
audio_0_45343.wav	So, this is a very common approximation that is used and that gives you very good accuracy also	test
audio_0_65609.wav	so it is better to layout the power lines on one of the top layers because they will be, they will be thicker in any case, they can carry more currents	test
audio_0_133520.wav	But, I have just passed the function name directly	test
audio_0_107479.wav	So, this is the way how you can understand the input bias current ok	test
audio_0_140960.wav	Then for every function or for group of functions, you have separate implementation files, which will include the same header	test
audio_0_59047.wav	we call from previous lecture that b zero is nothing but e zero over c	test
audio_0_33045.wav	And internally they are again dictionaries, so they have their own key value	test
audio_0_166144.wav	But now is the time to just look back and just think about one thing is that EDF and RMA they are actually different types of schedulers	test
audio_0_124327.wav	If we had just air in between, then it would look something like this will all epsilon 0	test
audio_0_127440.wav	Ok so a little bit of electrochemistry	test
audio_0_194277.wav	In this case then maybe 2 times the fundamental, 3 times the fundamental, 4 times the fundamental and so on	test
audio_0_198873.wav	So these are generally inherent problems that are face in such application where I am going to break the circuit and reconnect the circuit	test
audio_0_173605.wav	So we can in this way we can eliminate the i1 from the equation	test
audio_0_93424.wav	EFOT is equal to C into size to the power K where C is a constant based on the developmental mode	test
audio_0_36994.wav	That we have discussed	test
audio_0_38468.wav	So, as far as this EPROM is concerned, it continually seize the address bus address bits A7 to A15 and a when this PSEN bar line is activated	test
audio_0_97275.wav	If you don't have sufficient space, the arch cannot form and then you will not have load being resisted in the form of an arch or the arching action itself cannot be fully, you can't fully depend on the arching action in case geometrically you don't have the sort of a configuration	test
audio_0_213235.wav	So, this again becomes true length and this angle is the true angle similarly the line c d 1' with horizontal axis whatever angle its making true angle phi we will find	test
audio_0_146609.wav	This diagram shows how a parallel plate capacitor looks like	test
audio_0_1415.wav	So, let me clear and go back to that equation at KCL at node B, right	test
audio_0_176083.wav	So, like in this case we have two meshes we have assumed that both are in the clockwise direction with i 1 and i 2 values, so current will remains same but the link between these two meshes have been removed because it was containing the current source	test
audio_0_152654.wav	Now, equation 83 right, we know W is equal to F square plus W square this is We this is your W and this is your F right	test
audio_0_153691.wav	this is djj minus ajj, right	test
audio_0_57365.wav	for r is smaller than capital r and for r is greater than capital r	test
audio_0_208151.wav	In top view we can observe this inclination angle with the vertical plane, so that a point, b point and c point we can draw it	test
audio_0_67390.wav	so this is the basic idea behind writing a polish expression	test
audio_0_207735.wav	Similarly, transfer that length in this direction with the same 45 degrees angle	test
audio_0_190246.wav	Now, I am going to connect this to something called as an auto transformer, auto transformer is like an inductor, iron core inductor, nothing else, I just have a larger number of coils, okay	test
audio_0_46137.wav	So, I can have one another object over here no problem, I just have to include that in the definition of epsilon ok so, this is very general	test
audio_0_33701.wav	So, board of queen will tell us how many rows there are in the thing	test
audio_0_98290.wav	So, the stress due to compression is actually removed from the estimate of the flexual tensile strength	test
audio_0_212204.wav	How to construct such kind of spirals	test
audio_0_173668.wav	This is what we have also computed	test
audio_0_31546.wav	Now suppose we want to add a score to this	test
audio_0_199474.wav	So, again, I hope this part is very clear, otherwise, please go back and think about it	test
audio_0_113328.wav	This is my ideal response, it should look like this right	test
audio_0_158338.wav	And the debt equity ratio, which is perhaps the most common and extensively used debt is calculated as a percentage of equity but while calculating the ratio in the numerator we take debt plus preference share capital keep in mind actually normally shareholders equity includes preference share capital, but for the purpose of this ratio, we deduct it from the denominator and add it to the numerator because though it is a shareholder's funds, it is repayable within 5 to 10 years	test
audio_0_211824.wav	The top view front view we will be new portion to draw and it is inclination angle with hp also we will be in your position to find it	test
audio_0_77927.wav	On the basis of that we will prepare a cost sheet and that cost sheet will help us guide us to attain that cost which has been worked out in the cost sheet or in the statement of the cost	test
audio_0_47408.wav	So, this integration goes to the first term goes to 0	test
audio_0_66207.wav	so all this faults along the path will also be detected by this test vector	test
audio_0_123557.wav	We saw yesterday, was 1350 centimeter square per volt per second, mu h is 450	test
audio_0_202924.wav	And hopefully you will be able to recognize the structure	test
audio_0_124119.wav	So, how do we go from lumped elements to microstrip or distributed elements which we have to use when we are in the microwave domain	test
audio_0_31977.wav	Therefore, this means that for this permutation the next permutation is this one	test
audio_0_48484.wav	And the reference book for example, which is chapter 3 of this book by Volakis, they do not do the shortcut they go through get a larger system of equations then do some algebra to reduce it further	test
audio_0_64826.wav	now the way this tree is constructed is based on parameter epsilon, which is a positive constant which determines some kind of a tradeoff between radius and cost	test
audio_0_183867.wav	This is the upper trigger point of a Schmitt trigger lower triggers point of a Schmitt trigger	test
audio_0_47268.wav	Now, let say that this observer wants to change in some wants to move in some direction and this direction could be arbitrary and I want to know how does the potential change	test
audio_0_212757.wav	The 2D sketches what we have drawn the same representation you will have at computer level also because earlier days something like some 50 60 years back people communicate their skill set in terms of drawing, production drawings everything through 2D drawings, but nowadays these 3D softwares really help us to visualize the object to design it	test
audio_0_171307.wav	During the interviews sometimes candidates become confused as to with home they have to maintain the eye contact	test
audio_0_82767.wav	So, on the one side you will calculate the total cost from the cost sheet and then you will calculate the per unit cost also because number of units information is also given to us	test
audio_0_3557.wav	So, this; that means, this example intentionally I have taken	test
audio_0_126553.wav	You know that V out over V in can also be written as A V upon 1 AV Beta	test
audio_0_128617.wav	And we don’t really know why we seem to be able to get mercury in some gel pores in white cement but not in other cement	test
audio_0_174574.wav	There may be some cascaded networks also where the output of one network goes as an input to other two port network, in that case individual transmission parameters can be multiplied together to get the transmission parameters of the larger network	test
audio_0_4139.wav	67 angle 0 degree Ampere	test
audio_0_48907.wav	So, if this were light would you be able to see the tower	test
audio_0_75198.wav	5 but from the standard expected was 18	test
audio_0_129128.wav	But if you have magnesium sulphate as the attacking solution you form an insoluble solid called magnesium hydroxide or brucite and this brucite because of its nature of insolubility keeps promoting the dissolution of calcium hydroxide, this forward reaction involving magnesium sulphate and calcium hydroxide is promoted to such an extent that you can actually lead to a complete removal of calcium hydroxide	test
audio_0_41281.wav	So, the failure of absorbing boundary conditions is what we start with right; so, let us jump in to this discussion by starting by considering a lossy medium ok	test
audio_0_63601.wav	but subsequent to nineteen, nineties, when ah, the devices started to scale down the mos transistors this is called technology scaling	test
audio_0_135810.wav	Now, let say we have done an up cast	test
audio_0_46414.wav	The convention for this Jacobian differs from people to people some people take the transpose of this as the Jacobian whatever, but transpose does not alter determinant	test
audio_0_22226.wav	5 right So if I put the value of different parameters as fy as 250 gamma m0 as 1	test
audio_0_171453.wav	In this lecture, we will more focused about the circuit where the dependent sources are available, and we will try to solve the circuit for maximum power transfer	test
audio_0_149835.wav	Questions usually can be open ended or it could very tightly structured type of questions	test
audio_0_5419.wav	So, i L is equal to from this circuit i L is equal to V Thevenin by R Thevenin plus R L	test
audio_0_84557.wav	And ultimately uhhh desired amount of the return or the percentage of the return can be found out right	test
audio_0_33776.wav	Now the reason that we have to do this is because actually python does not allow us to create an empty list if we say something like l is equal to none and we want this to denote the empty list the problem is that none does not have a type as far as pythonÕs value system is concerned	test
audio_0_206500.wav	You pick some object; you will be in a position to draw	test
audio_0_132825.wav	So, the question is if I just draw, I could have base and specialized as D which is basically public, or I could have base and there is no specific notation available	test
audio_0_35490.wav	It is usually sound to just use dynamic programming as the default way to do the computation	test
audio_0_102046.wav	So, in the first case where the steel reinforcement in the Thai column which is in compression is also considered, then the axial force resistance, the total axial force equilibrium comes from the two, the location of this stress block	test
audio_0_40267.wav	This is actually now operating only on the surface	test
audio_0_124593.wav	And special case, this is the case when we have the gain stage connected to an attenuator	test
audio_0_41080.wav	Yes, that because any where inside and on the surface what is the electric field	test
audio_0_134902.wav	Unless I can access the next field of the node I cannot go to the next node on the list so I need to access them	test
audio_0_13375.wav	So, again again again for your understanding initially I am showing everything, suppose I am moving clockwise; that means, I am moving like this moving like this, moving like this, clock wise, right	test
audio_0_165093.wav	Now there are two important positions in the company, chairperson and CEO	test
audio_0_183981.wav	Thank you for watching	test
audio_0_103425.wav	We use top soil which is environmentally degradation in the environment which is today not acceptable and they are fired at very high temperatures which means that the embodied energy in manufacturing these bricks is rather high	test
audio_0_72648.wav	so while during the decomposition we have to care that the number of connections between these partitions or subsystems must be minimized	test
audio_0_79428.wav	We don't have the unlimited income so we always look for the quality	test
audio_0_111225.wav	I am sure that during your undergrad or masters, you must have studied electronics instrumentation or applied physics or electrical engineering or mechanical engineering, and have come across discrete components	test
audio_0_46066.wav	So, the right hand side which I evaluate now which now that I have done a little bit more carefully node 2 still gives me 0 as before and node 1 over here this is what I will replace over here ok	test
audio_0_182031.wav	So, maybe we can zoom into this, so look very carefully this trapezoidal shape is there, you can see it let me draw maybe some lines	test
audio_0_81362.wav	In that case again if you compare then there is a variance between the budgeted and the actual results	test
audio_0_195561.wav	So rather than writing capital XL1 and so on I am writing this as small x1, fine	test
audio_0_73215.wav	so this can also be used to carry the signal to various regions or zones	test
audio_0_134966.wav	We have talked about the basic requirement of inheritance and we have touched upon; we have discussed the very core two concepts of the affects of inheritance between two classes, that is how does the data members are inherited and object layout done and how does the member functions can be inherited with overriding and over loading playing a role	test
audio_0_166409.wav	In the worst case, the number of priority inversions suffered by a higher priority task can become unbounded and this situation can cause a high priority task to miss its deadline and therefore every real time application developer must take adequate precaution against unbounded priority inversion	test
audio_0_111397.wav	It is nothing wrong if you do not recall; what is conductor, what is semiconductor, what is metal; all right, I will give you an example	test
audio_0_143592.wav	The registration process is different for different rights the exclusive set of rights that patents and trademarks and copyright encompasses, they themselves can be different because of the subject matter being different	test
audio_0_106896.wav	What is the supply current	test
audio_0_179128.wav	What are those frictions	test
audio_0_49794.wav	Ok, it should be fairly clear till now	test
audio_0_208546.wav	There are important points	test
audio_0_174969.wav	So, first we will remove the load from the circuit	test
audio_0_58246.wav	we also said there the question we are traced was: can we define a potential for magnetic fields	test
audio_0_40336.wav	Right and I intermediate into a new scalar variable, I called it rho	test
audio_0_110504.wav	CMRR equals to Ad by Acm, so Acm would be nothing, but 0	test
audio_0_181025.wav	Now, we can give this square wave to the clock input of our counter here and then it will count the number of edges and that will give us the frequency right	test
audio_0_198296.wav	They have fairly not exactly accurately but fairly constant speed because you would see that series motor is just the other way round	test
audio_0_50009.wav	TM polarization	test
audio_0_129435.wav	In LC3 we looked at before what would be the composition 50% clinker, 30% calcine clay, 15% limestone and some gypsum and in each of this cases you see how much of electricity is required and how much of transportation is involved in the raw materials	test
audio_0_196688.wav	So, this will be the Te max, one thing one thing I would like to point out here in Te max, Te max does not depend on the rotor resistance at all, it does not depend on the rotor resistance, all though all along when we were talking about the torque, we always said I2 square R2 by S omega S	test
audio_0_153194.wav	Because I strongly believe that everyone knows MATLAB sim MATLAB simu link thing nowadays right	test
audio_0_61999.wav	this is a slight settle point, because this divergence will give me v, grad, v dot d s over surface of shell plus surface at infinity, and that gives me zero	test
audio_0_199174.wav	If you had a different kind of biasing or somehow modify this biasing so that this voltage is far above the gate voltage in quiescent condition, then the swing limit will be higher because the gate voltage can rise by a large amount and drain voltage fall by a large amount before the transistor enters triode region	test
audio_0_195479.wav	So what is available as the induced EMF which is actually giving me the relationship finally e1 by e2 equal to you know N1 by N2	test
audio_0_7165.wav	So, now in this case, 15 volt source is there and this is 10 i and this is your v 1 1 upon 4 Farad	test
audio_0_45643.wav	Delta t right so, that delta t the question can be should I have the variables being updated at the same delta t or some staggering over there as well	test
audio_0_7227.wav	One is natural response and other is the forced response right	test
audio_0_37848.wav	And, the best example is if for the sake of people who know and people want to study, one should study Eric Ericson’s	test
audio_0_12624.wav	So, this is your unit ramp function delayed by t 0	test
audio_0_184840.wav	So, this is the; this is the expression or the dynamics that governs the motion or movement of the moving coil at any instant, at any moment	test
audio_0_158612.wav	So you can see your instrument but in that instrument there are apps, there are various other things which are loaded on instrument which don't have physical existence but which are of very much used to you	test
audio_0_20222.wav	I guess he doesn’t have an iPad or a tablet or a mobile phone but I don’t know what he is up	test
audio_0_38071.wav	To earn from my parents	test
audio_0_2406.wav	Suppose this is my Q 0 is equal to I mean you write separately say Q 0 is equal to omega 0L by R and again you write Q 0 is equal to 1 upon omega 0 CR	test
audio_0_140288.wav	But if we just compare this to solution side by side you will see that this is the C solution this is the corresponding C++ class	test
audio_0_65800.wav	and the third move says: swap two adjacent operators and operands	test
audio_0_100177.wav	I am making reference to a simple equivalent static procedure the modeling and analysis that will lead to a simple equivalent static procedure, the modeling and analysis that will lead to a simple equivalent static procedure	test
audio_0_107105.wav	We have taken this image from the lecture given by Professor Bo Cui and he is from Waterloo	test
audio_0_117136.wav	So this means that at regular intervals as the counter is incremented the comparator would check the number of clock cycles that elapsed or the number or amount of time that elapse and typically would give a value of zero after right amount of period has elapsed the comparator would provide an output of 1	test
audio_0_31870.wav	So, if you have say seven different options, and you are only doing special things so 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7 are all the same then we can use else; we do not have explicitly enumerate all the other option	test
audio_0_82227.wav	But sometimes it may be possible that it is not possible for the firms to recover the full cost of production that is both variable and the fixed cost	test
audio_0_204419.wav	So, this is VGS minus VT square times the current factor and GM the expression we have been using is MUNC C Ox W by L VGS minus VT	test
audio_0_57545.wav	an electric field direction is in the direction of the current and, by boundary condition, right outside the surface	test
audio_0_214268.wav	When we are looking at this kind of views if we already know cylinder of so and sodiameter just representing something like a rectangular portion showing long dash, short dash clearly indicates that it is a cylindrical object	test
audio_0_112451.wav	How can we calculate the gain of a differential amplifier	test
audio_0_172991.wav	And when current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to time rate of change of current	test
audio_0_107722.wav	So, the reason is because I do not want you to miss out on the filters	test
audio_0_80748.wav	So, store if it is not properly managed or maintained then the material can get spoiled there also and or that material can become obsolete and we will have to pay the cost for that	test
audio_0_195185.wav	So there will not be any direct current flow from the high voltage side to the low voltage side or low voltage side to the high voltage side, so they are not conductively connected	test
audio_0_125538.wav	We started from 50 ohms first we have a capacitor in shunt and then an inductor in series	test
audio_0_51754.wav	So, now the usual problem is to find out the far field right	test
audio_0_103339.wav	So, that's the gist of what we had seen in yesterday's lecture	test
audio_0_161359.wav	And there are several items which do not form part of cash flow	test
audio_0_126077.wav	The input stability circle does not touch the smith with unit radius at all	test
audio_0_136941.wav	So, when the call is done, the function is in call	test
audio_0_207935.wav	Similarly, if these are cylindrical objects, we went ahead and showed the major diameters outside of the object through the symbol phi	test
audio_0_104951.wav	Next step will be 4th step which is expose it to u v light	test
audio_0_190492.wav	But now we do not know how much is the electrical input	test
audio_0_180333.wav	So, experiment you have some observation now we need some explanation why is it happening ok	test
audio_0_36806.wav	Inside we have a private implementation	test
audio_0_20538.wav	Then the activity is clearly marked as to what the person is going to do before, during and after and at least 3 steps, so this guys followed that	test
audio_0_215455.wav	Therefore, it is kind of agreed upon that content should be governing the decision of what way, it should be presented which should be supported by good and supportive appropriate visual and a strategy which will enhance the content communication	test
audio_0_109787.wav	You got the process	test
audio_0_150450.wav	So, with this we complete our discussion on personality	test
audio_0_173932.wav	So you will get simply the value of Rb	test
audio_0_72216.wav	so it will be something like this: these legs can be treated as transmission lines	test
audio_0_56204.wav	x is l by two	test
audio_0_183043.wav	So, let me draw the op amp plus minus; you can give the input here, you can give feedback to the negative side; negative input like this is V o this is call this R 2 R 1, this is grounded which means this is what	test
audio_0_69601.wav	so we discuss the asic design styles, in particular full customs, standard cell and gate array and the main issues involved there in for placement	test
audio_0_4579.wav	So, this side if you take omega less than X 0 omega here what we call less than omega 0 right, this side omega less than omega 0; that means, your capacitance inductance your reactance X C right it is greater than your X L this side	test
audio_0_65591.wav	see, this are the two parallel vdd and ground i am showing here	test
audio_0_131265.wav	So basically, I have marked 4 points or 4 positions in the gauge length of the specimen, the first one is 100 mm gauge length which is equal to the axial extensometer, why	test
audio_0_111098.wav	We already know the formula of summing amplifiers	test
audio_0_114943.wav	If, the value is either 1 or 2 it would mean that ASLR is enabled on that particular system	test
audio_0_2613.wav	So, 173	test
audio_0_127157.wav	Only this part is different from this part	test
audio_0_24432.wav	This, this bracket in bracket, whatever it is giving it for, it is for flat product	test
audio_0_180830.wav	So, I put this and gate here and the other input of the AND gate will decide how long or for what duration the accounting should continue	test
audio_0_147913.wav	We need to have some communication through which my mobile phone and the microcontroller with which it is connected with the accelerometer should communicate	test
audio_0_164507.wav	Now this is very important because if you tell somebody that total net profit of our company is, let us say, 1,300 crores	test
audio_0_209183.wav	One of them is in this direction; the other one is from this direction; the other one is from this direction	test
audio_0_59717.wav	i can also write this as a function of vector r	test
audio_0_212314.wav	So, call this point as N	test
audio_0_210539.wav	For example, we have such kind of machine element, more like our screwdriver type, where this is the handle portion and there is some kind of tapered hexagonal kind of pattern	test
audio_0_183078.wav	So, then let me write input equal input less than 0 will also imply output equal to V supply	test
audio_0_175252.wav	So we will only consider the nodes which are not, the loops which do not have common notes for non touching loop gain	test
audio_0_40099.wav	So, this we will say only acts on unprimed that is fine, so that is just a assumption	test
audio_0_60842.wav	k surface current is percent unit length	test
audio_0_44176.wav	So, E s x for example, what is the definition	test
audio_0_42166.wav	So, imagine 2 triangles over there right	test
audio_0_209275.wav	There is no difference between 1st angle projection and 3rd angle projection as long asfront view is concerned	test
audio_0_52071.wav	Can you think of a possibility where phi is non zero, but grad phi dot n hat is zero; what kind of a material would it be	test
audio_0_103546.wav	Let me move on to the second illustrative example and the second illustrative example is one that deals with a single story building again but with a rigid diaphragm and in this condition I would like to arrive at the diaphragm, the design forces for the different walls	test
audio_0_194204.wav	This is half wave rectified, but it is full wave rectified I have to again draw on the top of this also one more voltage right	test
audio_0_8670.wav	And next one is an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy, I told you earlier right	test
audio_0_49255.wav	There is a slight subtlety over here let us write this a little bit carefully	test
audio_0_41234.wav	The term that is left is what is the term that is left only second term right	test
audio_0_146988.wav	There will be a comparator, which will be checking whether this feedback, whatever you are reading is less than or greater than the set goal	test
audio_0_76445.wav	If there is a difference then we will use the fourth formula but if the total time is same summing up scaled, semi scaled and unscaled workers time then we will be going to use the in case of the labor mix variance or the gang composition variance the formula number 2	test
audio_0_62829.wav	when contrast the grid routing algorithms which you discussed, they are used, not directly associated with global or detail routing, but whenever we run into some problem, we use are routing because area routing is considered to be one where you can find path between two points which are otherwise not so easy to connect	test
audio_0_201240.wav	It could have a series resistance, it could be a current source and so on because all the arguments we will make now will be general and in terms of only the port variables	test
audio_0_197779.wav	So, this is having a cylindrical structure, at least and it will not have much of opportunity to get deformed	test
audio_0_37004.wav	So, they will bring; they will treat and person becomes alright, but then he has no work he has no work, he is empty	test
audio_0_70358.wav	this is d, so we are interested in line d	test
audio_0_127486.wav	Let us just keep it in the passive region	test
audio_0_174614.wav	So, let us write first the network equations for these two two port networks	test
audio_0_200031.wav	Now if ID is too large, that is, ID is larger than I 0, then this current will be negative, current will be drawn out of the top plate of this capacitor	test
audio_0_194622.wav	So Z axis will show me the current either going into the board or coming out of the board	test
audio_0_51750.wav	r square right, but here what do we see electromagnetic fields 1 by r far away from the sort of this smallest building block of an antenna which is a Hertz dipole, gives me a 1 by r ok	test
audio_0_145931.wav	You see in this typical curve here we have a resistance of the order of mega ohms, and on this point we have a resistance of the order of hundreds of ohms	test
audio_0_106848.wav	How this will affect on the Op amp circuit, we had PSRR of 90 6 dB we will have was 63000	test
audio_0_216674.wav	the name of this protocol is a m q p advanced messaging queuing protocol, ah	test
audio_0_1507.wav	And your b terminal is your negative right, it is negative, so that means when it is V a b this is positive, this is negative, it is V a b you can write V a b, arrow means positive arrow means positive, and here no arrow means negative	test
audio_0_206028.wav	Let me explain once again; this is more like a welded kind of thing portion what we are trying to see here, but the cylinder line comes there	test
audio_0_194852.wav	That is the reason I am trying to conduct this test by applying the voltage on the low voltage side, just for logistics reason, right	test
audio_0_143992.wav	A business is something, which continues over a period of time selling goods and services to customers, so the quality was required or some kind of a guarantee was expected for a business to continue	test
audio_0_8585.wav	This is the current and voltage relationship for a capacitor, assuming positive sign convention the relationships shown in figure 5	test
audio_0_7967.wav	So, determine i 1, i 2 and i 3 of the circuit as shown in figure 3 by using node voltage method, right	test
audio_0_153422.wav	So, power loss is high, but here from this diagram we can make out I dash; if you take it is magnitude I dash actually compared to this I is decreasing	test
audio_0_4174.wav	So, if you come back to figure 29 it is here , this is the , just hold on, is just the same figure where where you have derive the formula right this is the figure 30 and this is your this is the figure in this figure right	test
audio_0_181635.wav	If I give 0 and 1, Q will become 0	test
audio_0_67744.wav	now we shall see a little later how compaction is different from compression	test
audio_0_153597.wav	That is why you will find industry the shunt capacitors are always there	test
audio_0_179493.wav	So fro time t ranging between zero to two this will be zero so finally we are left with only only this will will which will become one and e to the power minus t minus lambda because this the u lambda is one for t greater than zero so when you will solve you will get the value of this I naught t between time t zero to two as one minus e by t minus and p f	test
audio_0_44470.wav	So, let us spend some time interpreting equation 2 so, equation 2 it is a three dimensional equation in the variables k x, k y, k z right and this e x, e y, e z all of these are numbers some numbers that I choose	test
audio_0_149651.wav	And nonsense syllables are basically very generously used in research in psychology, because it helps you understand learning in its purest form	test
audio_0_40318.wav	No problem I calculate this, but this summation goes over all the pulses	test
audio_0_38586.wav	So, externally we connect 64K	test
audio_0_155191.wav	If you do so, then this equation becomes this equation	test
audio_0_53469.wav	So let me clear up this clutter here	test
audio_0_43350.wav	So, the first variety is what is what would be called local ABC ok	test
audio_0_49126.wav	So, I can take all the metal parts and say this is	test
audio_0_169628.wav	This is the posture of a person who is willing to accept the proposal for example, where do I signed now to move on further	test
audio_0_178224.wav	And if you start doing the mesh analysis or nodal analysis it will take a lot of time and it will be almost impossible to do it in a reasonable time frame	test
audio_0_206925.wav	So, this is the X1Y1 axis above that point because it is a vertical plane, projection also front view	test
audio_0_217068.wav	if there is a node n who does not want temperature, you will simply not subscribe to it	test
audio_0_51341.wav	So, this is this term is called grid another term that we will encounter in finite difference time domain	test
audio_0_149519.wav	Now, for such type of things if I go for aggregating data then of course, now I get a compromised score wherein certain valuable information will be lost	test
audio_0_19799.wav	So we employed couple of methods one was the multi why approach	test
audio_0_184049.wav	Now let us consider this circuit once again	test
audio_0_75690.wav	The firm has earned during the year it is the shareholders share it has to go to the shareholders versus there is a time period allowed under the Indian companies act 3 months	test
audio_0_127785.wav	And I think the use of the bundle of information may be used for that	test
audio_0_79755.wav	So, the solution to the limitations of the master budget is the flexible budgets and variance analysis	test
audio_0_65066.wav	this end gate will be enabling the clock and the clock will come	test
audio_0_5956.wav	So, we can so, we must consider the 2 extreme possible values of R that is when R is equal to infinity and when R is equal to 0	test
audio_0_73448.wav	ok, this is the you can see in this step when you are talk about transistor layout	test
audio_0_61989.wav	so what i have tried to show you in this lecture is that you can think of the energy of a charge distribution as if it is stored in the electric field produced by this, with the energy density one half epsilon zero e square, and we have seen through three examples that this gives you the same answer as we obtained earlier with the direct formula	test
audio_0_10470.wav	And this is the load connected for the sake of our calculations easy calculations are for the sake of explanation	test
audio_0_203042.wav	It looks like this	test
audio_0_11223.wav	And here, Wattmeter reading gives only iron or core loss	test
audio_0_74442.wav	It means 60% is the cost of goods sold and 60% includes the material as well as the other expenses	test
audio_0_51063.wav	So, if I wanted to solve this problem in frequency domain, I have to solve for various omegas; then take the inverse Fourier transform and get the time response	test
audio_0_80024.wav	You are able to change or automatically the other figures or the other values are changed automatically	test
audio_0_118210.wav	So, you have two electrons in the s, two electrons in the p, they hybridize to form 4 s p 3 hybrid orbitals	test
audio_0_79505.wav	If you cannot serve their needs be the best product, you don't have the right to be in the business	test
audio_0_85474.wav	Now the sale is reduced either to the eastern market, central India or the northern part of India	test
audio_0_10609.wav	1 if you divide 100 by your your what actually this will become approximately 7	test
audio_0_165880.wav	These are simple schedulers	test
audio_0_76018.wav	So now we have to convert that into the proportion of 2 by 10	test
audio_0_36478.wav	So, the same function append is being use throughout	test
audio_0_122512.wav	So, r here is the distance between the electron and the ionize impurity	test
audio_0_93494.wav	The nominal development time, again we have seen the equation for nominal development time earlier	test
audio_0_178707.wav	Now, in this case what we have to do	test
audio_0_101860.wav	But it is also interesting to see where the additional resistance, where the global resistance to earthquake, favourable earthquake response of confined masonry constructions come from and simple calculations can actually be done to estimate the improved flexual capacity of walls when you have confinement and improved shear capacity when you have confined confinement by the confining elements in reinforced concrete	test
audio_0_4025.wav	So, if you this Thevenin equivalent if it is converted to the your what you call a current source and 6 ohm will be in parallel right with this	test
audio_0_4180.wav	So, your V P upon Z Y right	test
audio_0_151689.wav	So, as you know and indivisible part of a capacitor consisting of electrodes separated by dielectric material this you know; perhaps you might have seen in the, you know laboratory also and next is the capacitor unit	test
audio_0_20480.wav	D1 the first activity in during learning, yeah	test
audio_0_206180.wav	Second, we have to pick the views which one is front view	test
audio_0_118679.wav	This is called your saturation temperature, so that within the between the saturation and intrinsic your concentration of electrons which is your majority concentration is within 10 percent of the donor concentration Part e, you are asked to sketch a schematic	test
audio_0_208064.wav	So, perhaps this is the center from there it might be at R5 units	test
audio_0_6412.wav	In other words all this are all are underlines a linear circuit is one output is directly proportional to its input right output is directly proportional to its input, then the circuit is called a linear circuit	test
audio_0_53288.wav	Now here on the other terminal of the add adder we are having a DC voltage and here I have given minus 0	test
audio_0_209004.wav	A side view projected on to profile plane	test
audio_0_84717.wav	And then we talk about the cleaning, say next thing is the cleaning up time, cleanup of spilled solvents	test
audio_0_190622.wav	So I am having a reduction in the field energy and the reduction is the field energy is this shaded area	test
audio_0_216829.wav	lets clear this screen and lets try the round robin part of the direct exchange	test
audio_0_204797.wav	Now, these two incline lines, we are observing it on this plane	test
audio_0_205740.wav	Project D on to horizontal plane, then use this radius transfer that all the way down	test
audio_0_128678.wav	7 mm diameter which is typically used in pretension concrete systems and the next one of 15	test
audio_0_104489.wav	In phase, in phase means your input is this right their output can be in phase or out output can be out of phase, and this part is feedback to the input that should be in phase with the input, it should be in phase	test
audio_0_52117.wav	So, TE case what are my variables	test
audio_0_55910.wav	its component is cosine theta, so it's going to be cosine of theta	test
audio_0_46023.wav	So, point piecewise constant approximation I can make for or if k is something more complicated there is no problem what will I do for this term	test
audio_0_204947.wav	ISO is International Standards, SAE is Society of Automotive Engineers, ASME is American Mechanical engineering associations and BIS is Bureau of Indian Standards	test
audio_0_44788.wav	As you see it these equations do not have frequency directly anyway right	test
audio_0_198588.wav	So, whenever I do short pitching I cannot say that I am going to have actually, originally I should have E plus E, I should have had one of them as E another one also as E	test
audio_0_103480.wav	So, an entire family of thin, ultra thin, strong motors are being prepared today particularly to take care of this twin requirement of keeping joints thin but giving adequate protection to the steel reinforcement	test
audio_0_1528.wav	That means that means if for balanced voltage, magnitude V a n is equal to magnitude V b n is equal to magnitude V c n right	test
audio_0_347.wav	So, and this is the opposite term here it is R 1 you divided by you divide it by R 1 right	test
audio_0_19987.wav	You need to check each one of them to see if they are right or wrong	test
audio_0_170386.wav	Even in official presentation we find that as a general rule we present the easy portions of our message and presentation in a faster speed and the complicated parts of the information are passed on in a slow manner	test
audio_0_198599.wav	I am going to have this angle to be 30 degrees, which is corresponding to 180 minus whatever is the short pitch angle	test
audio_0_99049.wav	Now, the next goal is to be able to apportion this floor shear QI that we established in the previous slide to the different walls themselves and then to the separate resisting elements within the wall	test
audio_0_204205.wav	So essentially using these, any controlled source can be built using negative feedback	test
audio_0_101106.wav	And therefore what we will examine from the next lecture is how you could actually model a masonry structure using an equivalent frame approach	test
audio_0_177591.wav	Now first task is that again we have to transform this into frequency domain	test
audio_0_7046.wav	So, this is your if you apply your what you call that KCL at node 2 this is the equation	test
audio_0_166873.wav	So T1A, at the end of T1A it must leave the system with a consistent state	test
audio_0_114105.wav	So initially we have this processor and as we know that there is a cache memory which caches some of the recently used data and then we have the large lower cache memory of the data	test
audio_0_131727.wav	Without water being there in the system you really will not have any durability problems	test
audio_0_196458.wav	So, synchronous impedance is going to be the ratio of the current obtained under short circuit condition at rated IF	test
audio_0_56639.wav	we can do the same thing for b equation and we get in the b equation is curl	test
audio_0_205866.wav	For example, we can have one is a straight line other one is a curve	test
audio_0_208675.wav	If I am straight away looking from side view, it will be up to this portion we will be in a position to see	test
audio_0_171416.wav	Here I would also like to point out that there is a variation between the speed of speech and the speed of comprehension	test
audio_0_136482.wav	What does a distractor do	test
audio_0_123847.wav	So from here we get this is nothing but Vo the reflected wave at the source upon Vo+2gama x	test
audio_0_105860.wav	Integrator means it will integrate a lot of things in one	test
audio_0_69497.wav	you you have a simplified model that you can estimate that this is the delay of my gate	test
audio_0_106832.wav	Does not function properly means it will get damaged, in this case assuming plus minus 15 volts apply the input should stay below plus minus 13 volts right	test
audio_0_204224.wav	When VIA is 0, this is at 0 volts, and the output is also at 0 volts	test
audio_0_48780.wav	So, f must be in the range of L that is kind of obvious, but I am just stating it anyway ok	test
audio_0_157024.wav	Now retrospective memory, if you think that today I submitted documents to the bank, you have already performed the task and you remember okay	test
audio_0_59191.wav	so here is the pulse coming and it is getting transmitted after sometime	test
audio_0_123163.wav	Another way to do that is to have a hetero structure based device	test
audio_0_213758.wav	And, they are widespread in terms of shipbuilding and the other one is shoe industries also is quite popular	test
audio_0_161137.wav	That will be shown as intangible asset under development	test
audio_0_177504.wav	Whenever we have different set, different voltage or current sources operating at different frequencies we will see that the value of inductance and capacitance C not the value of inductance and capacitance, we will say that it is the impedance offered by the inductance and capacitance will be different	test
audio_0_108074.wav	So, for today I will request my another teaching assistant for this particular course, and he will be showing you how we can perform this experiment	test
audio_0_191095.wav	The flux lines are still flowing through every lamination without any problem, are you getting this point	test
audio_0_109539.wav	It happens regardless of any apply voltage that means, that you see motion at absolute is zero, slight heating will cause a random fluctuation or motion of the electrons	test
audio_0_30674.wav	5 for site welding gamma mw gamma mw is a partial safety factor for weld connection and this value can be taken as 1	test
audio_0_74559.wav	So, our sales are 700,700,000 So, how much expenses are going to be here	test
audio_0_206524.wav	So, you have to be careful in terms of using delete object	test
audio_0_152348.wav	So, that the line to line voltage is impress across the capacitor that is why you are taking X is equal to V line to line upon I C	test
audio_0_85700.wav	11,500 kgs and what is the inside the bracket	test
audio_0_68967.wav	initially you call it the seed	test
audio_0_201180.wav	So, we will say how to do that	test
audio_0_105275.wav	This is figure 19 a right aand the wwe have also have to perform a simulation, that I will talk it talk in a second	test
audio_0_134467.wav	So, if we have to swap then the copy operators are copy constructor in the copy assignment operator has to be there in the available trait of the function parameter a type parameter T	test
audio_0_124994.wav	The closer they are, the lesser will this second level of reflection	test
audio_0_121475.wav	If your material is a direct band gap material then this recombination will dominantly produce light and the energy of the light is just given by the band gap	test
audio_0_82953.wav	You write here operating profit per ton per unit	test
audio_0_210798.wav	So, here we will have horizontal plane	test
audio_0_146200.wav	In the normal flow of execution; the instructions are normally stored one after the other in memory, PC points to the next instruction to be executed	test
audio_0_85832.wav	They are 330 and minus 38	test
audio_0_1858.wav	Therefore, I0 produces the flux and in the phase with the flux	test
audio_0_200618.wav	But the picture is somewhat incomplete because with the transistors that we have, we can only have currents that are being pulled from a node	test
audio_0_45798.wav	Let us see what is the problem in a realistic antenna ok	test
audio_0_65840.wav	so lets look into it	test
audio_0_69483.wav	so when you are doing timing optimization as a subsequent step to timing analyzes, you are identifying the critical portions of your design, like, for example, the portions where the slacks are negative	test
audio_0_99054.wav	So, this is what we are going to be examining	test
audio_0_211164.wav	So, now, you have designed this part and you have other parts already ready	test
audio_0_198473.wav	So induction starts, synchronous run motors are generally used only in somewhat lower capacity, some of the clocks, microwave turntables where you wanted to rotate at a particular speed, constant speed	test
audio_0_131046.wav	But we also found that there are, it may also affect the durability related properties or transport properties, one example here I am showing is the water Sorptivity Index, so here how we do is you take a disk of concrete and then you put that, place that in a small water bath not immersed but just place like this what is shown in the picture and then you weigh the you know see how much water is absorbed by the, because of this soption by the concrete disk	test
audio_0_114107.wav	Now during the 2nd access to the same table at the index P4 XOR K4 there are 2 things that can occur	test
audio_0_217192.wav	i will not redraw the circuit, the ah details of it, but please do go through this specification	test
audio_0_1701.wav	Similarly, for I b and I c so, will go back to that	test
audio_0_163648.wav	But when we come to solving a case, we will consider other ratios as well	test
audio_0_13659.wav	Next that R N or R that R Norton is equal to your R Thevenin same thing	test
audio_0_166153.wav	So we will consider a task set on schedulable under RMA but schedulable in EDF and then of course we can find the two schedulers produce different schedules	test
audio_0_189897.wav	See we wrote I rated multiplied by Z equivalent divided by V rated as percentage Z equivalent or per unit Z equivalent, I can similarly write, I rated multiplied by R equivalent divided by V rated will give me percentage R equivalent, instead I can multiply and divide by I rated, so what I will get will be I rated whole square multiplied by R equivalent divided by kVA basically because V rated multiplied by I rated is kVA	test
audio_0_209608.wav	First of all, we have to draw an XY line	test
audio_0_130490.wav	But the input is concentration, right	test
audio_0_107438.wav	So, first one is input bias current Ib1 and Ib2	test
audio_0_36525.wav	This tells two things this says the value is empyt list, so it is also tells python the fn denotes the lists these are the two steps going on here as we see	test
audio_0_196328.wav	So the power is flowing in this direction right	test
audio_0_130561.wav	So, now we need to think about the manufacturing of the CSA based cement using industrial byproducts, because that will drastically reduce the cost, okay	test
audio_0_105433.wav	So, we have seen all the kind of filters possible filters that I can show it to you quickly in the part of as a part of this particular curriculum or part of this particularor course	test
audio_0_190878.wav	Because 3 phase generation started only later, initially it was all DC generation	test
audio_0_152539.wav	So, this area actually projected area of the conductor covered without ice in square meter per meter length, because we have consider 1 meter length right, 1 meter length and this one Ani is equal to cross section area of conductor covered without ice in square meter and your l is equal to length of the conductor in meter	test
audio_0_204326.wav	So you take the worst case limits from all the limits imposed by transistors	test
audio_0_12769.wav	That this is one 80 degree, then this is 270 degree, and when it will come to this one it is 360 degree, right	test
audio_0_116141.wav	So, in addition to all of these columns, there are other columns like this	test
audio_0_169275.wav	Sometimes it can also be related with simple curiosity for example, a child is staring a phenomena for a long duration	test

audio_0_19328.wav	And to para phrase what Nitin said how do you communicate the concept because you have a product I mean you do have I know what do you mean by I do not have a product it is a conflict, so on the one hand you have something like a prototype it is not a full fledge product like you would see in the market, you pick it up of the shelf it is not that, but neither is it an idea that in one of our heads or in shared concept, we can see it in the front, so how do I really convince somebody that this is the exact concept I have in my mind, this is just a sort of reflection of that	test
audio_0_34663.wav	And initially we say that list1 points to this and list2 points to this in the last assignment say that list3 also points to this	test
audio_0_83839.wav	These days, means as per the company's Act 2013, the income statements are prepared in the vertical order, not in the ones which I told you	test
audio_0_54857.wav	This would be the max	test
audio_0_197979.wav	Which means it is going to work like a capacitor	test
audio_0_215636.wav	You may start with the topic by asking the learners to construct an initial concept map which provides diagnostic assessment as well as leads the learners to think over the content	test
audio_0_63250.wav	so you see, once we have defined the bounding box, we expect that all pins has to be there	test

audio_0_166967.wav	Therefore, it is easy to see that under highest locker protocol chain blocking cannot occur	test
audio_0_18973.wav	So let’s look at some of the examples we looked at last time	test
audio_0_145789.wav	Periodic or cyclic condition for the si	test
audio_0_28353.wav	Say for example if we draw this figure whatever we have seen and this is a column which is connected by a weld	test
audio_0_90513.wav	So, this is as a matter fact in that course this is the first time I am introducing a medium a specific medium	test
audio_0_1986.wav	So, ns is equal to your 120 into 50 divided by 4 right	test
audio_0_103789.wav	It can, it will basically overlap at some point or become higher in value in terms of tau with respect to the second criterion	test
audio_0_36509.wav	For example, m n are numbers, similarly i, j and f at each step are numbers	test
audio_0_69276.wav	to some extent we we cannot do as good as external testing, but what best we can do, let see that	test
audio_0_206067.wav	Once it is done wherever we will feel these maximum dimensions that maximum dimensions we are going to show it on that object	test
audio_0_69294.wav	earlier we had only our circuits under test, but now we have a test generator, we have a response compactor	test
audio_0_192849.wav	So we have stator and rotor are the 2 portions in an electrical machine where they may be accommodating, one will be accommodating field which will produce magnetism, the other one may be accommodating the bunch of conductors in which electricity is produced which we call as armature	test
audio_0_112291.wav	There is no sign, right	test
audio_0_107596.wav	2 milliseconds, that is, what is the output of each of these half periods, it will be ramped	test
audio_0_191604.wav	So, please understand this again and again if I am talking about actually an armature and if I am connecting a small resistance, I am going to demand more current, for a given voltage if I connect smaller resistance I am demanding more current that means I am loading the machine more	test
audio_0_110001.wav	After this what we will do you will expose using UV	test
audio_0_169861.wav	So, you would find that the smile, its presence, its absence, and too much presence are all noted by all our interactants	test
audio_0_139931.wav	The basic principle of inheritance is I have some concepts which is this and I am trying to specialize to provide a more special concept which need to satisfy everything that the general concept satisfies	test
audio_0_15073.wav	Ignore magnetizing current right	test
audio_0_62321.wav	it is like paramagnetic material but takes in many more lines and very weak field outside	test
audio_0_65834.wav	that is one of the means optimization criteria in the step right	test
audio_0_34542.wav	So, factors of 0 is 1, factors of 0 colon 1 the slice is also 1, but here we have a single value here we have a list and therefore, these two things are not equal to each other right	test
audio_0_52581.wav	So, of course, we need methods that are we have to be safe means no radiation damage, and if this big divide between rural India and urban India has to be bridged then it has to be inexpensive quick	test
audio_0_43801.wav	Can you visual it any difference between these two	test
audio_0_169377.wav	I may constant use of it especially, in conversations, I am digging for information If we show a conversation partner that we are interested and approve what they say, they tend to get more talkative	test
audio_0_154146.wav	Next one is	test
audio_0_108169.wav	Input signal was 1 volt, output signal will become 10 volts, right, this what we have seen	test
audio_0_39207.wav	So, you can you can use this individual bits for different port as different port bits ok	test
audio_0_151207.wav	So, this is actually the voltage at t is equal to 5	test
audio_0_7149.wav	I have drawn it here, right	test
audio_0_116544.wav	And as we see over here, on the X axis it shows the Hamming distance between A and B and the Y axis shows the probability	test
audio_0_137771.wav	So, we were continuing to use the complex as a class	test
audio_0_129912.wav	Then you determine, you plot the chloride content versus the depth in the concrete then this is Fick’s second law, you fit this curve to this whatever the data which you collect, you fit that to the Fick’s second law equation and then you determine this value here, what is diffusion coefficient	test
audio_0_73292.wav	ah, you can say, i mean it is by difficult to even think about doing this steps in a manual fashion, because it will take years to do even a very simple, small part of it	test
audio_0_12525.wav	So, the derivative of the; it is underlined only the derivative of the unit step function u t is the unit impulse function	test
audio_0_184833.wav	So, the basic idea is that this is the inertia times the angular acceleration, this should be same as the sum of all the three types of forces damping force, spring torque and the deflecting torque ok	test
audio_0_49164.wav	I will say the same operator remains similar ok	test
audio_0_190134.wav	If you use it, see, basically gets oxidised definitely and when it gets oxidised, unless you remove the Oxidation portion, the resistance will not decreased	test
audio_0_206145.wav	So, this direction we have to pick it this is a good choice for picking front view compared to this one	test
audio_0_212041.wav	75, any eccentricity less than 1 we will be getting this ellipse and distance of focus from the directrix is 70 mm, if that is the case construct an ellipse	test
audio_0_109974.wav	A bright field mask, we have here photoresist positive, we have here SiO2 and I am exposing with UV; I am exposing with UV	test
audio_0_215429.wav	Now, to meet that learning outcome what you should do is to create simulations of virtual environment for learners to know the environment, provide opportunities for learners to be able to play with the different parameters and features inside the software and also be able to see the results of their actions	test
audio_0_84984.wav	We are not going to pay that whole amount in the month of January	test
audio_0_174382.wav	So, the difference between first approach and second approach is that – in first approach we assume input as known and we take some assumption that the input given to the circuit is maybe unit step or something like that	test
audio_0_48696.wav	So, L for example, is you know d by d r, if I multiply r prime r prime has no relation to r right	test
audio_0_123010.wav	Depending on λ you can choose the appropriate detector	test
audio_0_172635.wav	How we will connect them	test
audio_0_177209.wav	Because the amount of wire which is required for 3 phase system is lesser than the amount of wire needed for an equivalent 3 single phase systems	test
audio_0_133171.wav	And also, the scopes may be nested, like block scope, class scope, namespace scope; they may be nested	test
audio_0_153265.wav	From this equation you guess that for the steady state values; steady state value K p is responsible K p and in this case those speed governing mechanism	test
audio_0_70352.wav	so the concept is that for every line in the circuit we associate a fault list	test
audio_0_131282.wav	So, we have completed the test now and we will look at the stress strain plot of the TRC element and see what are different characteristics that is involved in a TRC element subjected to tensile stress	test
audio_0_63729.wav	ok, now, one very important issue is that routing is important because inter connections in a typical chip can take us to an overrate of almost thirty percent, or even more of the design time as well as the area over it	test
audio_0_3746.wav	This current and this V 0 you can assume whatever you want 1 volt 2 volt	test
audio_0_130422.wav	So basically you fill your tube with cement slurry and using this gauge you can monitor the change in length, right	test
audio_0_139693.wav	Similarly, for checking empty you pass the stack s to the global function empty, here empty is a member function	test
audio_0_52875.wav	The Inductor design is also along similar lines as we discussed for the transformer with few minor variations now let me start in this fashion we know that flux is equal to MMF by reluctance now this is equal to permian's into MMF	test
audio_0_167932.wav	He does not like what he hears, he does not like what he sees	test
audio_0_46962.wav	Ripples; ripples were in the point or even closer to home in when you are have a bath, you put water in your bucket you see ripples like this right on the surface of the water right	test
audio_0_120178.wav	E g slightly lower is around 1	test
audio_0_178832.wav	So, you got y 11 and y 21 from this circuit	test
audio_0_78931.wav	So, if we can recover this by increasing the price of the final product in the market because HR cost has gone up and it is not because of any one's fault	test
audio_0_156187.wav	So, the voltage at a given point in time and distance is found by adding all terms that are directly above that point	test
audio_0_70273.wav	so this is just a very simple example i have given, but here we shall be looking at much more delay, ah, delay related issues and other problems there in in our next modules, where we discussed these things in detail	test
audio_0_105632.wav	Now, thus, how you can define input bias current	test
audio_0_175685.wav	First, let us recap what we discussed in the last class	test
audio_0_70210.wav	so in this part two we continued discussion and look at some of the other steps which are also very important in the physical design cycle	test
audio_0_2394.wav	But when omega t is equal to 90 degree if you put 90 degree then V is equal to 0	test
audio_0_2399.wav	So, therefore, since when the now when the capacitor voltage is maximum the inductor current is 0 and vice versa when; that means, when capacitor voltage here it is this point 0 in this your what you call this inductor current is maximum or when inductor current is 0 this point capacitor voltage is maximum vice versa	test
audio_0_193842.wav	So most of the energy that is going towards magnetising the entire structure goes into actually magnetizing the air gap because the air gap is difficult to magnetize you are going to have higher and higher reluctance	test
audio_0_128160.wav	These are again UHPC Pi girders, Pi girders are called Pi girders because they have a shape of the Greek alphabet Pi and these are very common bridge girder elements	test
audio_0_197042.wav	So, these are the 3 topics that are still pending	test
audio_0_161899.wav	We also have one more course on cost accounting which will discuss about the accounting issues related to costs	test
audio_0_189691.wav	so, let us say what would happen if we print this particular line, so, printf percentage x, buffer 2	test
audio_0_58205.wav	So, this x here sin of tan inverse L over 2 x which actually becomes again I cancel this 2 with this and give you 2 to get 2 q lambda over 2 pi Epsilon 0 1 over x sin of tan inverse L over 2 x is going to be L divided by square root of L square plus 4 x square, that is the answer for F x	test
audio_0_147580.wav	And if you have several design alternatives, you should have a way to compare their speeds	test
audio_0_206226.wav	Engineering drawings enables the students to learn the techniques and standard practice of technical drawing	test
audio_0_182253.wav	So, in this case peak is once again if peak is A then RMS will be how much	test
audio_0_110630.wav	Now this transistor should be biased properly biased correctly, right	test
audio_0_171203.wav	Number 6 is sadness; now, sadness is the hardest to micro expression to fake	test
audio_0_197031.wav	So, that can be compensated for only by having differential compounding and not cumulative compounding	test
audio_0_2106.wav	And therefore, s is equal to 1 minus n upon ns say this is equation 5	test
audio_0_1866.wav	That you are this I0 actually not exactly in phase in phase with I write because it has some core loss that is iron loss that is eddy current and hysteresis loss	test
audio_0_154844.wav	That means, the potential will be whatever is the voltage of the downward leader that is that coming from the cloud through the conductor; it will raise to that potential	test
audio_0_211685.wav	Once this division is done, we have to measure distance A to 1, let us name them as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on	test
audio_0_179170.wav	In this case t1 through these gears is transferred to the second gear that is having torque T2	test
audio_0_170760.wav	It is also associated with the rhetorical repertoire of aesthetics identity and uniqueness	test
audio_0_40376.wav	And what are those quantities	test
audio_0_151088.wav	So, that is why OP is equal to x and the portion OP is in equilibrium under the action of T, H and Wx	test
audio_0_52762.wav	During the time on Q1 is on, this point is at V In Q1 has to withstand V In during the time on Q1 is on this point is at V in and this point is at ground and therefore Q2 should handle V in so when you rate the device they have to be rated for maximum at least V in it should be greater than V in	test
audio_0_159362.wav	Financing is plus 9,000	test
audio_0_131304.wav	So, let us look at each of these in turn and what we can do with them	test
audio_0_190683.wav	So there is no point on talking about in what way it is better than induction generator because induction generator is hardly ever used they are not used very commonly	test
audio_0_46940.wav	Because if for example, in this coordinate axis if my delta function is over here and my observer is over here at theta and r then; obviously, the way this source is emitting there is a theta dependence for this guy over here	test
audio_0_41337.wav	One quick thing I want to point out that this k prime which I have written as k r minus j k i both k r and k i will turn out to be positive numbers ok	test
audio_0_124331.wav	But sorry, but this entire space outside and inside of this metal layer is covered with a material having a dielectric constant epsilon effective	test
audio_0_85560.wav	You talk about the steel, you talk about even you talk about the services sector the telephone industry, communication industry talk about there was one department dot department of telecommunication right and later on it became BSNL also	test
audio_0_161698.wav	We have first understood what is a final output in the form of balance sheet, then P&L, then cash flow flow and now we are going to understand what is a recording part of it	test
audio_0_17430.wav	I would like to get some feedbacks from your side what more can be done with the application or any feature you want it to add more than what it has	test
audio_0_116951.wav	Therefore, it the return to libc attack would not work	test
audio_0_42685.wav	This is like the j term you have a question no yeah	test
audio_0_31489.wav	For all this what we require is a way of capturing these errors within the program as it is running without killing the program	test
audio_0_103726.wav	As I said this is expected to occur when the level of pre compression is low	test
audio_0_40114.wav	So, this is canceled, so, I am just left with this all right	test
audio_0_34998.wav	Now, in this case we were looking at max heaps; we can also do a dual construction where we change the heap condition to say that each element must be smaller than its children, in which case we have what is called a min heap and then instead of delete max, the operation we perform is delete min	test
audio_0_11169.wav	This is I am giving you a small exercise that why I am writing V 1 difference or V 2 the difference operator	test
audio_0_117926.wav	Now that we have identified where the address of system is present and also, we have found a string in the executable which contains slash bin slash bash and we found the address of that particular string, we are ready to build our exploit	test
audio_0_166517.wav	So, these are basically clock interrupts	test
audio_0_120212.wav	In the case of a semi conductor these electrons and holes are set to drift through the material	test
audio_0_120896.wav	And we will have holes in the valence band	test
audio_0_140737.wav	Now, while usually we will expect a function to take one or more parameters, it is possible that you write a function which does not take any parameter	test
audio_0_194167.wav	In which case you may require a plus 5 volts for some of the IC’s within your computer, you may require 3	test
audio_0_177608.wav	How we will express that	test
audio_0_208994.wav	Our text book is engineering drawing by ND Bhatt, and Panchal, and others	test
audio_0_114874.wav	So let us say that we have an instruction like this where we want to move the address of a variable to this register EDX	test
audio_0_201210.wav	Now in this particular case you can calculate it and it is very easy to see that it is simply equal to R1 parallel R2	test
audio_0_112253.wav	So, for this particular same way if you see this one right, it goes to many more complex layers	test
audio_0_97227.wav	So in this case we have seen earlier that the permissible shear stress in the code is	test
audio_0_139423.wav	So, we will see that for the static and friend function the meaning of inheritance would be quite different	test
audio_0_212149.wav	If we are drawing an ellipse, it goes via this points, once we know V prime and V we can make intersection point so that a perpendicular bisector meets at O	test
audio_0_126179.wav	So, that is why port 3 and 4 are isolated and port 1 and 2 are isolated and the remaining are either through or coupled	test
audio_0_180124.wav	It will not because something different will happen at the moment when it reaches the level V cc by 3	test
audio_0_166842.wav	The second constraint will put a lower bound on the frame size, which is that the execution time of each task must be accommodated in one frame	test
audio_0_192832.wav	That’s what we are going to look at in this particular section	test
audio_0_48764.wav	Need not be orthogonal, I can have non orthogonal basis also	test
audio_0_111110.wav	aA band stop response is between f L and your f H right	test
audio_0_139120.wav	It has double type, but it does not have a complex type	test
audio_0_103960.wav	ETA value is going to be significantly small in comparison to the length of the wall	test
audio_0_186458.wav	Among the service mix people is the most important element as specialized knowledge is basic and most important requirement for superior treatment of the patients	test
audio_0_3404.wav	Therefore, the rms value is always greater than this rms value is always greater than average value for a your average value except for a rectangular wave	test
audio_0_13429.wav	So, minus 16 volt the polarity will be reverse	test
audio_0_189805.wav	So let us try to look at the utility of it, okay	test
audio_0_78986.wav	So, generating information one, getting actual information two and then comparing actual with the budget and then say taking appropriate decision at the top level of the firm is the ultimate purpose of this budget and budgetary control and facilitating the management decision making	test
audio_0_49683.wav	So, the question is that T these 2 functions T a 2 and T b 2 they have a different sign on the edge it will not matter	test
audio_0_10187.wav	And it is 2 sin A sin B that is cos A minus B minus cos A plus B put that use that formula	test
audio_0_12652.wav	Now, if you; that means, this function actually this function, this gate function actually is equal to sum of 2 unit steps a function that is this is one plus symbol is here, I made it plus right is equal is this one; that means, this one you can; that means, mathematically if you write like this; it will be 10 u t minus 3 minus 10 u t minus 6 because if this one plus this one	test
audio_0_147494.wav	And there will be a point where this sale will saturate and beyond that point again this sale will start dropping down	test
audio_0_147648.wav	And initially I set the duty cycle to the maximum 1	test
audio_0_205985.wav	This is the object we will like to represent it on the drawing sheet	test
audio_0_19000.wav	So if we look at it one more time in terms of a plot if you remember from my last time we had plots for plotting the 5 why analysis	test
audio_0_196017.wav	Now, if I actually try to come to 0 and go towards minus 10 ampere, right	test
audio_0_198494.wav	So there will be definitely different in terms of the induced EMF quantity in each of these turns	test
audio_0_180285.wav	Measured this, measure this value, measured t 2; t 2 is to be measured ok so, basically we have to measure this time right	test
audio_0_20399.wav	Then you need to go back to the drawing board and say, hey, you know what	test
audio_0_140884.wav	Name is as if you are saying that the star p is an integer	test
audio_0_47619.wav	So, imagine there is waveguide I want to send wave through very simple we know analytically in these cases we can even analytically calculate what the fields look like, but that is not our objective let us see what this simulation does	test
audio_0_126156.wav	So, constructive interference	test
audio_0_42683.wav	Looking at it what can you say	test
audio_0_205313.wav	Now, zoom into this portion, add lines, perhaps we would like to have a very vertical line from there to there, done	test
audio_0_201719.wav	If you don't recall this, go back to basic electrical circuits and then find out about this theorem	test
audio_0_110573.wav	So, the inverting; this is plus V in is positive here this is non this is non inverting this is inverting; that means, at 2 minus 1 is 1	test
audio_0_150317.wav	Now, what happens in this case of 16 PF we you get the items, you respond to them and then you are assessed	test
audio_0_84706.wav	So, we could have managed the show with still much lesser cost of material but usage of the material somehow went up	test
audio_0_139147.wav	A one major point to note here that plus is a binary operator, so it needs two operands	test
audio_0_166092.wav	And also we have interrupt latency requirements	test
audio_0_34582.wav	A list can be transformed in place we can take a list and change its structure unlike a string if we try to change a string we have to actually construct a new string and re assign the name, but in a list with the same name we can update parts of it without affecting the other parts	test
audio_0_54442.wav	So that way, NG sim helps you do that one	test
audio_0_54536.wav	The voltage here is VN and the voltage that appears across on this side is N times VIN because of the terms ratio 1 is to N	test
audio_0_31806.wav	There are three fundamental things all of which we have see informally in the gcd case	test
audio_0_142788.wav	If you need to be an applicant, you need to demonstrate by what proof you are claiming the status of an applicant	test
audio_0_190269.wav	So, under no load condition we take it that the series parameters hardly ever play a role in the voltage drop as well as in the power loss	test
audio_0_155881.wav	078 kg per meter that we have calculated, L is given 150 meter and T just we have computed 6450 kg	test
audio_0_47369.wav	The places where the function goes to 0, right	test
audio_0_132208.wav	That is, if you have multiple parameters in a constructor you could put the initial values of these parameters in terms of a pair of in the list notation and use an initialization symbol after the object name	test
audio_0_194618.wav	So in which case I can say if I am looking at the magnetic field direction like this	test
audio_0_146412.wav	Whatever data communication you want you can see it in this port	test
audio_0_63685.wav	and similarly, when i say that the output of this gate is going from one to zero, which means the capacitor was already in the charge state is one high, it is discharging through this path	test
audio_0_100378.wav	So, if you actually examine the test setup, the compression load is actually acting along this line	test
audio_0_131735.wav	For example if you have air entrained systems which have a lot of voids but these voids need not be essentially connected in the same way as we expected for a high water to cement ratio concrete	test
audio_0_111116.wav	So, if I go on the next slide, then you have an example to solve	test
audio_0_214859.wav	A MOOC again is not merely a collection of lecture videos uploaded on a platform	test
audio_0_107047.wav	When you talk about dry oxidation, you have silicon, a wafer at very high temperature about 1200 degree centigrade, loaded into a thermal furnace	test
audio_0_109435.wav	So now if we know what is the change in the voltage, that we can understand using oscilloscope, right	test
audio_0_64238.wav	during this time primary inputs are dont care, and p, o and scanout we dont know, or this can be empty	test
audio_0_183405.wav	So, if this is the case then how much will be the error	test
audio_0_60721.wav	the poisson's[U14] equation is: is del square, v e equals minus rho over epsilon zero	test
audio_0_10895.wav	So, this is the area A is equal to l into b right	test
audio_0_210386.wav	If one is using A3 sheet, then the drawing board required is D3 size	test
audio_0_20627.wav	And his answer was customer visits are few, are fewer than they used to be	test
audio_0_165865.wav	We say that a scheduler S1 is more proficient than S2	test
audio_0_170718.wav	I would prefer to Roland Barthes who has commented that food is a situation and it is closely related with our culture	test
audio_0_184086.wav	Because maybe the next day I did not make these terminals as tight as it was on the first day	test
audio_0_18218.wav	Wiki for notes	test
audio_0_61043.wav	so i can anticipate, by again same form of the equation, that a will also be in the phi direction	test
audio_0_169157.wav	At the same time we find that eyes communicate is certain sense of trustworthiness	test
audio_0_33463.wav	So, we do not have f with us anymore	test
audio_0_35795.wav	This is the problem involve in words	test
audio_0_185650.wav	If the pendulum is trying to move from right to left, then the friction is always from left to right	test
audio_0_173378.wav	And we will see how we can use those properties in our circuit analysis	test
audio_0_212754.wav	So, it went down; now, click Ok	test
audio_0_211074.wav	Now, I am not interested about this point	test
audio_0_216168.wav	And here she is today to share her experience on e learning from industry perspective	test
audio_0_70405.wav	or there is another condition: there is an event in l, s means s becomes one, which means a one get selected	test
audio_0_207721.wav	Now, what we want to do is rotate this entire object in this direction	test
audio_0_150630.wav	Now if a surge having a maximum value of 100 kV, travels along the overhead line towards its junction with the cable calculate, a	test
audio_0_110432.wav	So, if my Vo equals to Ad into V1 minus V2; then Ad is gain with which the differential amplifier, amplifies the difference between two input signals and it is also called as the differential gain	test
audio_0_138272.wav	Now moving on a C supports another kind of collection container, which is pretty much like structures, they are called union	test
audio_0_209738.wav	First of all we will draw the top and front views of one of the ends because it is a line there will be two ends like a point and b point and one of the ends we will draw it	test
audio_0_50330.wav	So, it is the same principle seen from two different waves; the first wave is the physics based wave the second wave is a more math based wave ok	test
audio_0_14206.wav	So, torque is a constant and back Emf in the first case E b 1 will be V minus I a 1 r a	test
audio_0_128354.wav	And then you have to find out the measured packing density of each of the aggregate classes	test
audio_0_102952.wav	The stepped failure continues but then by the time it then by the time it reaches 90 degrees for uniaxial tension you have a flat line, you have the bed joint failing	test
audio_0_61067.wav	if i take this direction to b, the z direction in which the current is going, b is nothing but mu naught over 2 pi s	test
audio_0_161915.wav	But what this course enables you too is to understand some basic accounting and financial concepts	test
audio_0_134782.wav	The top simply returns the element from the top position; push increments the top position and puts the new element which is been given to be added to the stack on to the stack and pop simply decrements the top point at or the top index	test
audio_0_134086.wav	What does the combination of values in the data members decide the combination of values in the data member we have seen in the last module decide the state of the object	test
audio_0_201746.wav	And I have my original circuit with a 200 microampure current source	test
audio_0_58811.wav	let an electromagnetic field exist around it so that we have e field and b field in this region	test
audio_0_178250.wav	Now this open circuit voltage across the terminal a b in the circuit on the left must be equal to voltage source VTh in the circuit on the right	test
audio_0_117576.wav	So, after these 4 steps are done the enclave is ready to use and then the application could actually use various instruction EENTER and EEXIT to enter and leave the enclave	test
audio_0_112627.wav	So, UJT is a non linear amplifier it is a low cost and used in free running oscillators synchronized or trigger oscillators and pulse generation circuits at low to moderate frequencies this application now you see here it is nothing, but it looks like a PN diode right and then there is a resistor due to the B 2 here and then the resistor due to B 1 which is here, right	test
audio_0_74355.wav	So, April sales we had made and out of those April sales what were the total means why this information now it must be clear to you why this April information is given to us	test
audio_0_36378.wav	So, all we need to do to compute the factors of m is to test every number is range one to m and if it divides m without a reminder, then we add it to list of factors	test
audio_0_149064.wav	Now if you look at the methods used in psychology, the tools that are used in psychology would realize that most of the researchers heavily depend on questionnaires	test
audio_0_153469.wav	So, this is equation 5 right but for easy remembering I r into r plus I x into x l right; where I r is equal to I cos theta and I x is equal to I sin theta right	test
audio_0_122418.wav	So, if you plot n versus 1 over t, we are going to get a straight line with the slope that was given by the ionization energy	test
audio_0_94732.wav	So how to measure the effort	test
audio_0_215899.wav	Another strategy is to intersperse small activities between the chunk where the logical pause point is	test
audio_0_124093.wav	And from here we see that we can also, we have a path along this constant conductance circle where G equal to 1 to the origin	test
audio_0_176741.wav	How we represent, we represent in the asterisk form, so what we say that yt is equal to xt, this is not a multiplication, this is asterisk and ht	test
audio_0_170894.wav	If there is a combination of two or more kinesics signals it becomes a sentence	test
audio_0_119242.wav	But the aluminum gallium arsenide layer helps in passivating the surface bonds or the surface defects states, it also has a higher band gap then gallium arsenide so that it allows the radiation to pass through it and be absorbed by the gallium arsenide, this intern leads to a higher efficiency	test
audio_0_114477.wav	So, the payload that we will actually consider is to create a shell	test
audio_0_164018.wav	Now, in the end if you look there is a table which is showing the type of the asset and estimated useful life	test
audio_0_193365.wav	So, whenever, I am actually running it freely or free running test I am going to have s equal to 0 because of which it is as good as rotor is open circuited because r2 by s becomes infinity, right at s equal to 0	test
audio_0_85111.wav	So, why that there was a gap between the standard and the actual time and that gap is not a small gap	test
audio_0_182956.wav	And, this gap is tau sampling period a period 1 over tau is the sampling frequency	test
audio_0_110989.wav	So, in this particular case, let us see how the circuit will work, let us see how the circuit will work, right	test
audio_0_39307.wav	So, I am writing this again so that you get used to this convention that we have and this of course, is global ok	test
audio_0_161975.wav	Actually the answer is you do to need to record more because in cost accounting you are recording with lot of more details	test
audio_0_125107.wav	Another path exists between A1 and B1 like this	test
audio_0_70621.wav	and if you have a bad placement, obviously i have mention it earlier you may not be able to complete the routing	test
audio_0_177203.wav	Because, there are 3 major reasons of that, first, the electric power which we get in our houses or in our industrial establishments are mainly the 3 phase power	test
audio_0_40550.wav	I can continue that idea here and say nodes right nodes are the node values are unknowns and we will see in the next slide how to construct the shape functions	test
audio_0_13457.wav	So i 0 you have got 6 ampere so, v 0 will be 4 into 6	test
audio_0_2261.wav	And the fact that the excitation current must be drawn from the main that is the stator side right	test
audio_0_4961.wav	So, this is 200 into 2	test
audio_0_111586.wav	I will give an example at the end of this particular course like I said, technically	test
audio_0_6864.wav	So, basically i 1 I writing here for you	test
audio_0_115836.wav	So the virtual address space as we have seen in the previous lectures comprises of two components, so it comprises of a user space where your typical code stack heap and other data segments are present and above a particular memory location you have the kernel space	test
audio_0_213952.wav	Now, on this normal to surface we draw a hexagon, a hexagon 6 sides we will construct it	test
audio_0_176893.wav	So here we will apply match analysis again and try to find out the current value I0 in first case that is when Vs is equal to 12 volt	test
audio_0_214094.wav	So, if I am taking a cone, so, usually in drawing practice, anything behind the object which is not straightforwardly visible, we show it by dashed lines	test
audio_0_17369.wav	Okay so this is a basic note taking application we have developed as a part of our solution in design thinking	test
audio_0_169985.wav	But this is not exactly concerned with our discussions	test
audio_0_213419.wav	The other method is called glass box method	test
audio_0_65566.wav	the first approach is refer to as a grid structure	test
audio_0_60616.wav	of this three halves, one, h, comes from b applied and one half of h comes from the m which has been induced	test
audio_0_2497.wav	So, now, Z star if, that means, what you can do is that, you should not be confused with this what you can do is this all are same	test
audio_0_109957.wav	So, when I etch my metal what structure will I have, I will have structure which will look like this, right this is metal, this is PR photoresist, this is my SiO2	test
audio_0_38568.wav	So, no code memory is in general ROM	test
audio_0_59050.wav	when i take the time, average sin square k dot r of minus omega t is going to give me a factor of two, one half and therefore this becomes one half e zero square over mu zero, and c is nothing but square root of epsilon zero, mu zero one over	test
audio_0_205872.wav	With the time the location of that point moving from one location to another location along the curve or perhaps you are defining something like it has to go along particular surface like a curved surface, maybe it might be rolling on a sphere, it might be rolling on an ellipsoid and so on	test
audio_0_147536.wav	This is a very important consideration	test
audio_0_111885.wav	So, let us connect another probe to this oscilloscope	test
audio_0_158326.wav	Here we want to know whether company has enough current assets to pay for its current liabilities	test
audio_0_162702.wav	I hope you remember that while discussing depreciation, we had discussed some concept and that concept has direct bearing on the valuation of inventory	test
audio_0_11117.wav	So, then what we can do is, we can write I square is equal to I square is equal to i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square divided by n right or I is equal to square root of i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square sum it up, divided by your n, right	test
audio_0_8369.wav	You see both dot I mean this kind of thing here it is minus here it is minus right here current leave the terminal reference dot is this one it is coming flux right	test
audio_0_2116.wav	So, Kw1 is winding factor I am not discussing this here just you keep it in your mind, because more you will study in your electrical engineering in your third year induction machine	test
audio_0_83301.wav	Similarly marginal costing, marginal costing is a part of is a technique of the cost accounting not of the management accounting	test
audio_0_111849.wav	So, if I were pressing amplitude, I will know see the top signal at the amplitude, all right one line our cursor is at the top of the waveform	test
audio_0_193091.wav	W will be the final operating point after all the acceleration is done with different values of resistances	test
audio_0_167766.wav	It doesn't tell about that	test
audio_0_51761.wav	This is my computational domain	test
audio_0_115975.wav	In this demo will be actually looking at an example of how Position Independent Code works	test
audio_0_10507.wav	Similarly, for the three phase case, R dash will be rho l upon pi r dash square right	test
audio_0_215758.wav	Because, there again you are going to come back and your graphics team is going to get annoyed with it	test
audio_0_112605.wav	So, you have to look at the data sheet	test
audio_0_61014.wav	because [calculate/calculating] calculating a potential is suppose to make calculation of the field easier, as we saw in the case of electric field	test
audio_0_117521.wav	We will look at how applications would use the Intel SGX feature and we create enclaves	test
audio_0_44047.wav	So, let me move everything else on to the other side	test
audio_0_174875.wav	So this particular lag will be completely short circuited then and that case the Zn will be left with only 5 ohm resistance	test
audio_0_104494.wav	Then we have amplifier we output voltage this output voltage is feedback to the feedback network and that goes back to the input signal right easy, very easy right, super easy	test
audio_0_210912.wav	Then on both sides, because this is a symmetric objects on both sides it naturally adjusts to that	test
audio_0_72066.wav	standard cell	test
audio_0_124793.wav	And this similarity is because of this the lostless and reciprocal nature of this circuit and due to the relationship that we had give it a condition for 2 port network just we that had derived earlier a few slides early you can verify them that this modulus of this will be same as the modulus of S 2	test
audio_0_183277.wav	So, now V y will discharge	test
audio_0_92013.wav	We will see what these specific terms mean as we proceed in this lecture	test
audio_0_60696.wav	so h in both cases is one over four pi three m dot r r minus m over r cubed, as just derived because of the analogy of the equations	test
audio_0_40339.wav	Xn is known	test
audio_0_126919.wav	If you can for a moment go back to our slides, monitor slides what you see is for theta these are the chevsif polynomials once again, for theta between minus one and plus one the value of the Chebyshev polynomials represented by this gamma is also confined to this range, that is minus one, plus one	test
audio_0_159070.wav	Long term provisions is a small amount	test
audio_0_5874.wav	So, it absorbed power	test
audio_0_85166.wav	30 weeks, not hours, 30 weeks are given	test
audio_0_109681.wav	Input resistance to Vi2, when Vi1 equals to minus Vi2 will be equal to	test
audio_0_52321.wav	So, now, let us imagine that you know where you know in the business of calculating radar cross sections for aircraft ships and so on ok	test
audio_0_73923.wav	Because monthly requirement is 4725000 and C has been worked out as 113000	test
audio_0_216768.wav	so when you say it is streaming stream oriented, it is sort of angering with constrained devices, ah, where you have low memory, right, you have low memory	test
audio_0_106716.wav	This is very important to understand in finite voltage gain ok	test
audio_0_215557.wav	Because again what is well known is that very few people actually go ahead and in fact, participate in the forum unless there is something a little extra	test
audio_0_169585.wav	The sentences they use a rather short encrypt and they are always in a hurry to reject the proposals because often they tend to overlook the details	test
audio_0_10855.wav	So, please draw phasor showing V showing VI V1 V2 and V3 everything right	test
audio_0_211790.wav	Let us see that step by step	test
audio_0_107390.wav	Now, we do not worry about it because that is another part where you can understand and learn how to design the circuit	test
audio_0_69866.wav	so these are some ways of modeling this interconnection wire	test
audio_0_107679.wav	See the voltage	test
audio_0_66409.wav	this is how we just estimate f sw	test
audio_0_161253.wav	If we have a asset, it's value it's a value, there is no reliable estimation available, then also we cannot value it and show it in the balance sheet	test
audio_0_54616.wav	Now if you if you take the current rating for the VJT you will see that the average of the inductor current will be I in and I in and I not are related if you use the abs second balance you will see that I in I in into D is I not or I in will be I not by D and therefore you know the average value for the BJT here	test
audio_0_159239.wav	For even more simple, you can remember that cash and CL these two of each other's pair they will go together whereas cash and CA are competing they would go opposite just CL yeahad rake whose opposite moment is for current assets okay now after adjusting debtors and creditors we get cash generated from operations but before tax	test
audio_0_121379.wav	If you remember, there are mainly 2 kinds of devices, those in which you have an injection of carriers that recombine in order to give you light	test
audio_0_213015.wav	There is an option to rotate when you rotate it this triad also rotates	test
audio_0_45008.wav	The other thing that we said is that it satisfied in this particular case, what kind of boundary conditions that we have	test
audio_0_76323.wav	So this is the 400 into standard rate minus actual rate	test
audio_0_171701.wav	So this we finish our today's class and next class we will discuss about the one of the most important term called RMS values because whenever you analyze the electrical circuit, you will always get the Vm and Im as represented in terms of RMS value	test
audio_0_147706.wav	And for motor drive, I have connected to D3, and D4 is the input that is coming from the output of the opto coupler	test
audio_0_95917.wav	So, two important examples are there	test
audio_0_141337.wav	We are specialize from here, we go to the manager we has specialization of engineer we add new data members so that managers can actually keep the recording reporting information	test
audio_0_70234.wav	so we can model this as a signal flow graph where we use two dummy notes in the input side and the output side, and every, you can say every signal line or every gate can be represented by a verdicts	test
audio_0_53497.wav	The operation of the flyback converter and the waveforms will be exactly like that of the buck boost converter except that we have put this extra turns here	test
audio_0_167587.wav	So, one task may be waiting for long time and it's about to miss its deadline, then the scheduler will increase its priority so that it will be able to meet its deadline	test
audio_0_146485.wav	It is a system that will detect smoke, whether it is present inside a particular room or a particular area	test
audio_0_138699.wav	So, it a return values could be lost could be ignored and so that this is not a very effective mechanism for doing this	test
audio_0_133905.wav	str to the name	test
audio_0_41550.wav	Now this domain over here I am going to I want to determine to a very high resolution right	test
audio_0_148792.wav	Now, he talked about now penis envy and castration anxiety	test
audio_0_154963.wav	Similarly, from equation your this from equation 69, right	test
audio_0_131145.wav	So ideally when you talk about CPC coating you should get something from here to here but because if you do not apply proper cleaning and proper surface preparation you will have something this which is not really useful thing to do and when you talk about the amount of money invested, so what do you see like there is no significant increase in the chloride threshold	test
audio_0_215685.wav	So, what you can do is maybe give them relevant examples like when I refer to a scenarios you can give an example where they are possibly going to use this	test
audio_0_146919.wav	So, as an acceleration is applied, a force is developed	test
audio_0_136830.wav	And I writing the virtual keyword in front of it may be a good practice, because anybody else can quickly understand that, but it is not mandatory	test
audio_0_194507.wav	So let us try to take a look at exactly how this looks when we are having the phasor diagram completely drawn	test
audio_0_127642.wav	It has got its limitations	test
audio_0_210977.wav	Now, what I have to do, give a left click on one of the point	test
audio_0_76654.wav	So the cost of goods sold will be, goods to be sold will be 12,500 worth of the dollars	test
audio_0_62607.wav	this is similar to the electrostatic energy which was given as one half epsilon zero e square	test
audio_0_217190.wav	you see, this data sheet that you see here, ah, now lets see if it is own enough	test
audio_0_174716.wav	Now although the mutual inductance M is always a positive quantity the voltage that is mutual voltage represented as M dI by dt may be negative or positive	test
audio_0_199664.wav	Now how do I connect it to this	test
audio_0_174583.wav	Similarly, V 2a can be written as Z 21a I 1a Z 22a I 2a, so you can see from this particular figure this would be the Z parameter equations of this network will be the equation which we just saw	test
audio_0_142618.wav	Late realization of this dilemma whether to publish or to patent could lead to disastrous consequences	test
audio_0_3078.wav	6 ohm is not effective nothing will go through this	test
audio_0_10835.wav	38 angle 22	test
audio_0_103342.wav	As far as ancient building systems are concerned, we examined this concept of the thrust line	test
audio_0_117281.wav	So, I hope by now that you have actually install the virtual box and you actually have this Ubuntu running as shown over here	test
audio_0_163577.wav	Now as the name suggests in horizontal analysis we compare	test
audio_0_179690.wav	Now, what next you have to do, you have to just equate the coefficients of like powers of s	test
audio_0_166019.wav	No, because these are of lower priority tasks and high priority tasks don't cause inversion to lower priority task	test
audio_0_31794.wav	And when we now come to something which is not a definition then python will try to execute it, this in turn could involve invoking a function in which case the statements which define the function will be executed and so on	test
audio_0_69843.wav	but the case that i shall be talking about now is, lets say we have two inverters that are connected in cascade may be we are designing some kind of a buffer	test
audio_0_122540.wav	If you look at the total mobility, it will be dominated by whichever scattering process has the lower value	test
audio_0_145579.wav	Now, apart from the inventive step which would be critical in drafting the claim, you will also get information on description and background of the invention	test
audio_0_74303.wav	So, we will be starting with the total amount of the sales and when you see the sales, particulars means the sales and it is divided into two parts	test
audio_0_706.wav	So, this will be required for sometimes for solving numericals therefore, rotor resistance by stand still rotor reactor and t maximum torque if you put in that expression, you will get 3 upon omega S into 0	test
audio_0_127682.wav	One another thing that we learnt from this was actually that the corrosion rate was being diminished in zone 1 which was the lower corroding one	test
audio_0_170682.wav	The studies of regulators focus on the facial expressions, etcetera in the listener	test
audio_0_106280.wav	That means, if I if I have a pad here and if I connect this line here andt if I measure the impedance I have infinite impedance	test
audio_0_38734.wav	So, each pin of the I O port; so, it is internally connected to the CPU bus	test
audio_0_93338.wav	Unlike the waterfall model where the test activities occurred only when only in the integration and system testing here this slide it just says what are the system the test activities occur during the requirement analysis and specification system test case design activities occur high level design the integration test design activities occur and during the detailed design the unit test design activities occur the strength of this model is that it emphasizes verification and validation	test
audio_0_167633.wav	We just said that the scheduler examines the task having the earliest deadline and then schedules it	test
audio_0_169531.wav	In New Zealand it is still practiced in ceremonial fashion	test
audio_0_215398.wav	As you see here each of the corrected and effective learning outcome is stated from learner perspective using action words which are measurable	test
audio_0_146774.wav	Initially, we are checking for the variable “val”	test
audio_0_45946.wav	So, which all terms will appear in U prime or you can look at this form look at this form of U of x now you have to evaluate U prime of x	test
audio_0_39110.wav	So, this is my interrupt service routine in the in the in the interrupt service routine what I will do	test
audio_0_129585.wav	Later on if you get larger amounts then the quantification becomes more accurate	test
audio_0_173997.wav	So if you see in this figure, these currents I1 and I2 are called as mesh currents	test
audio_0_213119.wav	Now, using our compass from A; what we have to do is; pick a radius, pick a radius greater than half of AB	test
audio_0_64509.wav	and when you are retracing from seven, you are looking for a cell which is one less six	test
audio_0_5643.wav	So, mu where mu r is the relative permeability and is defined as mu r is equal to flux density in the material divided by flux density in a vacuum right	test
audio_0_104577.wav	So, this 180 degree if I introduce a phase shift of 180 degrees in my beta, if I introduce a phase shift of 180 degree in my feedback network, then 180 degree plus 180 degree, there will be my 360 degree 360 degree is equal to 0 degree correct, 0 and 360 degree are same	test
audio_0_203288.wav	Now let's say the nonlinear element is in some operating point condition	test
audio_0_67819.wav	so we are saying number of possible input combinations: two to the power m possible signature, two to the power n	test
audio_0_13482.wav	Therefore, i 1 we get minus 6 ampere if we will get i 1 is equal to minus 6 ampere means the current actually in this branch flowing in other direction	test
audio_0_121772.wav	35 μm, so the same 350 nm the percentage absorbed using the same formula is only 16	test
audio_0_195620.wav	28 or 0	test
audio_0_21375.wav	Now, in case of high strength friction grip bolt the friction will be coming into picture for calculating the design strength of the bolt	test
audio_0_135196.wav	But I can still define a pointer to this type; I can define a reference to this type	test
audio_0_17567.wav	Yeah, in class I always do	test
audio_0_103835.wav	So let's examine the first criterion, the first mechanism, the in plane flexual mechanism and here we are really considering a wall that has boundary conditions at the top and the bottom	test
audio_0_113770.wav	Now as we know what malloc would do is that it would look into the link list and it would pick one of the chunks which is available, so in this case it would actually pick the first chunk which is a and thus what you would see and what is expected is that a as well as c would point to the same memory chunk, so both of them would have the same value stored in them	test
audio_0_130863.wav	So, for instance this is very common in construction projects in infrastructure projects where they want to specify the quality of concrete to be used on marine zone or 1	test
audio_0_69395.wav	these are getting shifted, one, one, one, one	test
audio_0_117610.wav	It has relative positions of the pages in that enclave security flag associated and so on	test
audio_0_212223.wav	All the way from 3 goes intersect there	test
audio_0_154867.wav	Some time that arcing thing, it may sustained at that time you have to; for 50 hertz or 60 line voltage	test
audio_0_109054.wav	What does high pass filter means	test
audio_0_82400.wav	And that's what we did it	test
audio_0_203500.wav	And to sense the difference at the drain, this is I D and this is I 0, the difference at the drain, this is ID and this is I 0, the difference current, ID minus I 0 flows through the capacitor	test
audio_0_147147.wav	So, this is the ADXL 335 accelerometer, and I will be doing the connection with STM kit	test
audio_0_45638.wav	Now we said that in space the variables was staggered by half a grid right, staggered by	test
audio_0_213431.wav	Now, the observer looks from there	test
audio_0_46830.wav	These two conditions there is a name for them they are called Null boundary conditions	test
audio_0_73087.wav	of course, here i am assuming that i am starting with some kind of a random placement, not placing them one by one	test
audio_0_59451.wav	what if i calculated the, calculate l through the flux formula, that is, i calculated total flux divided by i	test
audio_0_35578.wav	If, on the other hand, we want to compare the strings by length, then, the same argument would give us plus 1, because, aab has length 3 and is longer than ab	test
audio_0_50801.wav	Curl I know by stokes theorem is going to convert to a line integral	test
audio_0_134765.wav	So, these are the different stacks states all that we can keep on doing is we take; scan the expression from left to right, take a free operands, put it into the stack, keep on stacking till we come across an operator	test
audio_0_115284.wav	One way of bypassing ASLR is if the attacker determines either by brute force or by special attacks known as timing attacks, where the attacker finds out where in the entire virtual address space of the process is the library actually loaded	test
audio_0_41317.wav	So, we are just check this once again if this is what we will get yeah	test
audio_0_162266.wav	It is a statement which shows normal incomes and expenses	test
audio_0_193776.wav	Now I am going to pass a current here, so let us say I am going to pass a current here from i because of which some movement is taking place but still the spring is holding it pretty tightly	test
audio_0_180372.wav	So, this is the explanation of why this plate is moving when we move this magnet ok	test
audio_0_51674.wav	So, we started with the general solution over here and we said physically that a is equal to 0 is the only meaningful thing and that gives me this	test
audio_0_65721.wav	so what we are saying is that in anyone of the edges you add a vertex and we add a dummy edge here, so this is no longer a complex triangle	test
audio_0_20839.wav	Probably verifying his notes with all, cross checking his notes from that particular class	test
audio_0_64415.wav	and every line computation we needed one additional and and one additional or operation during the simulation processing	test
audio_0_126689.wav	So one simple way to do that, suppose you know we have letÕs say a particular frequency F 1 gain like this, so this is my gain, this is frequency	test
audio_0_16190.wav	So, after this you have to solve for your what you call i 1 and i 2	test
audio_0_202102.wav	It's only with nonlinear devices that you need power amplification	test
audio_0_164318.wav	Still compared to other industries, it's a ratio on a lower side	test
audio_0_85517.wav	So, that company was manufacturing two different products at that time	test
audio_0_192241.wav	If you may recall, in dynamic breaking or rheostatic breaking what we did was to connect a resistance, we had connected a resistance the field was still there but what we did was this EB was circulating a current IA which was actually getting dissipated, the current was dissipating the power in form of heat in Rb	test
audio_0_206708.wav	For example, here we have this vertical plane and this is the horizontal plane and our cylinder perhaps resting in that way	test
audio_0_48986.wav	Now, if I try to solve this problem in the most general 3d way it is going to be a little bit complicated	test
audio_0_147619.wav	You see there is a small hole in between and the wheel is actually placed in between those two plates here	test
audio_0_127549.wav	But with the other metals you have to extract it from its ore	test
audio_0_176518.wav	Capacitor will be represented as 1 by s	test
audio_0_210735.wav	So, from here and this is the point so, a free hand sketch	test
audio_0_102337.wav	So, the flexual failure mechanism, when the formulation is made, the formulation is based on a flexual compression failure occurring at the compressed toe	test
audio_0_18227.wav	So this would be a situation where you have already mentioned	test
audio_0_74609.wav	Our sales are say 10,000 units up to the point we start planning for the next period	test
audio_0_146590.wav	We continue with our discussion on Sensors and Actuators	test
audio_0_90037.wav	So, these are Glycol Protein	test
audio_0_73317.wav	and here we have another very important, you can say, empirical rule or law that has driven us over decades	test
audio_0_173868.wav	And similarly for T also, you can write the names of the terminals like 1, 2, 3, 4	test
audio_0_92527.wav	It is a measure of work that is being done	test
audio_0_156946.wav	And more know rhyming you make it the better you would succeed	test
audio_0_182849.wav	So, we will have a pattern like this, like a loop ok	test
audio_0_5632.wav	So, it is circumference is 2 pi r that is actually length l is equal to 2 pi r	test
audio_0_104195.wav	So, if the wall thickness which is the thickness of the masonry panel is Tm and the elastic model is of the masonry can be estimated as E	test
audio_0_66481.wav	so the required arrival time is less than the actual arrival time	test
audio_0_51774.wav	So, what was what was the very start of this course we have talked about Huygens principle	test
audio_0_102485.wav	And researchers who worked on the subject have proposed empirical expressions that take care rather well the effect of the geometry on the state of shear stress causing failure itself	test
audio_0_101.wav	And if you apply your same way if you apply your KVL, so you will get it your I E b is equal to V minus I a into R plus r a	test
audio_0_111971.wav	Typically, the minimum value is 20 nanometer and the maximum value is 200 nanometer	test
audio_0_37406.wav	I think that is a common share of emotions which the whole humanity has	test
audio_0_37129.wav	So, there first we should understand what depression is for the benefit of the audience and people who are attending in this course can actually teach other people also that is how awareness grows	test
audio_0_171704.wav	So we will see how we can derive The RMS value with the help of the peak values and sinusoidal termed	test
audio_0_64124.wav	so the main issue was difficult to control and observe the internal flop flops	test
audio_0_135596.wav	So, what is required is in this context we need to make a suitable extensible design, design so that we can as a required add new employee types and new processing logic for the processing of salary without making significant changes to the existing code or if possible not making any change at all in the application that finally process the salary, this is the basic target	test
audio_0_212653.wav	Similarly, click the left side face	test
audio_0_164437.wav	So, we can refine it a bit and say it, call it as credit sales upon average debtors	test
audio_0_122116.wav	One thing we have not look much is how we actually do the doping	test
audio_0_63325.wav	what are the different kinds of parameters that you define with respect to a clock	test
audio_0_65159.wav	so, earlier what you have seen, we can either increase the size of a gate, we can reduce the delay of a line, possibly by inserting buffers	test
audio_0_135195.wav	if I try to instantiate the object then I will get an error, because certainly if object cannot be instantiated unless I know the constructor, destructor, other operators and members and so on	test
audio_0_62338.wav	as the first example, let us take the case where i take a sample of magnetic material, paramagnetic or diamagnetic, and put it in a uniform field b	test
audio_0_139234.wav	It does not matter, whatever you need, you can put there	test
audio_0_135473.wav	We have seen how on a hierarchy of classes, we can have virtual functions and how virtual functions dynamically bind to the object instance instead of binding to the pointer or reference to which a particular virtual function is being invoked	test
audio_0_153393.wav	Impedance is Z is equal to r plus jxl and Z is equal to here r plus jxl but at the receiving end say if shunt capacitor is connected current is I c and it is reactance is x c and this is the same phasor diagram as in the case of without anything right	test
audio_0_72859.wav	three means you replace it by three vertices which are connected among themselves	test
audio_0_31632.wav	So this says, take these three values, take three these names and assign them these three values	test
audio_0_175395.wav	Suppose, if we are asked to find out the value of I1 and I2, the circuit, the Z parameters are given Z11, Z12, Z21, Z22, if you see in this case Z12 is not equal to Z21, so that means the circuit is not reciprocal	test
audio_0_41291.wav	I replaced the current term by Ohm’s law and I replaced by d by dt by j omega standard right	test
audio_0_105500.wav	Signal is applied to the non inverting terminal	test
audio_0_47913.wav	So, this, but to make math simpler we had done this to avoid singularity	test
audio_0_159951.wav	It is also known as E BIT or PBIT	test
audio_0_138250.wav	0 plus j 3	test
audio_0_193642.wav	Okay, so normally we should write if it is a motoring mechanism d W e which is the electrical power input for a short duration, that should be equal to whatever is the increase in the field energy plus whatever is going to be increase in the mechanical energy plus of course losses	test
audio_0_33697.wav	Place queen we said takes the row i and the board and the first thing it does it has to determine	test
audio_0_184564.wav	For some value of V d which is positive and what else can you see ok	test
audio_0_165984.wav	In the memory locking feature the programmer can lock a memory page	test
audio_0_156689.wav	And this is relevant cue that you are giving to yourself, because next time if you have to look at the photographs that you know, clicked in Agra you will go for know, the folder which has the name Agra	test
audio_0_101793.wav	But basically you estimate the permissible stresses limited by a maximum value, FV, for your design where you are providing web shear reinforcement and require the web shear reinforcement to be resisting the shear forces coming onto the wall or without the web shear reinforcement	test
audio_0_18125.wav	The third truth is that of “Nirodha” or Cessation; put an end to the suffering	test
audio_0_75099.wav	So, it means what is now the variance	test
audio_0_125091.wav	When we look from a purely transmission line point of view, the matching of circuits is similar to the matching using lumped elements but a little different principles are involved	test
audio_0_58364.wav	so the bound charge on this cavities going to look like what i shown in the figure: on the inner surface is negative on the theta zero onwards and positive on the lower side	test
audio_0_35206.wav	And then worry about the programming language	test
audio_0_129749.wav	And this is the problem and this is why you need a certain amount of expertise to apply the technique because if you let all these variables vary at will, then you can end up with any old rubbish	test
audio_0_32959.wav	And remember that the remainder is always less than n so we do not have to worry about flipping it and taking max and min at this point	test
audio_0_52898.wav	And once you have done that, we can do the design of the inductor in a very simple way	test
audio_0_60974.wav	by using the equation that divergence of e is equal to rho over epsilon zero, we can write this equation as epsilon zero, mu zero d by d t of divergence of e, with a minus sign plus divergence of v	test
audio_0_179450.wav	Now this particular approach let us try to understand with the help of one example	test
audio_0_114007.wav	So, thus when the fork system calls return, we have the child process which is exactly duplicate of the parent process	test
audio_0_39438.wav	So, they in fact, this endpoints will cancel except at the very endpoints of the	test
audio_0_167362.wav	We assume that the execution time is CS or ES, okay, the notation used here is CS, required every PS time	test
audio_0_172890.wav	Now, the value of resistance R can change from zero to infinity	test
audio_0_197757.wav	The same thing holds good in this particular case as well	test
audio_0_191209.wav	So Eb I can calculate	test
audio_0_109048.wav	In the last module we have seen the applications of operation amplifier	test
audio_0_113119.wav	Now, if you see what are the advantage of active filters, why we have to use active filters, why we have to use active filters, why we cannot generate the circuits using passive filters	test
audio_0_134918.wav	Now, if the list classes are delete function it will also need to be friend of node and so on	test
audio_0_37192.wav	Do you proceed as	test
audio_0_628.wav	So, it is one and here speed is 0 this side need not bother and this side breaking mode and this side is generating mode a little bit explanation only will be given and that is all right	test
audio_0_104550.wav	It will stop amplifying and start oscillating here	test
audio_0_63740.wav	this is a block i have placed	test
audio_0_113393.wav	74	test
audio_0_200541.wav	It has an amplifier inside	test
audio_0_45844.wav	So, to keep things very concrete what I am going to do is I am going to assume 3 segments just 3 segments and we will build our system of equations for 3 segments	test
audio_0_184610.wav	So, there and this so starting from 0; I have a potential drop	test
audio_0_113977.wav	So we have 2 versions of this rdtsc function other one is for 32 bit and the other is for 64 bit and if you are using trying to actually replicated this particular covert channel on your own machine, you could suitably enable one of these 2 functions	test
audio_0_176512.wav	And h22 you will get as I2 upon V2	test
audio_0_169974.wav	Some of them included bursting crackers beneath their seats	test
audio_0_169880.wav	Smiles are controlled by two sets of muscles, zygomaticus major muscles which round down with side of face and connect to the corners of a mouth and the orbicularis oculi which pulls the eyes back	test
audio_0_10239.wav	And you will get again it is half V m I m cos theta is equal to V I cos theta	test
audio_0_49846.wav	So, which way is it going to go	test
audio_0_214108.wav	Usually, it ends, we show it something like a mark x x; that means it is a kind of plane which we are going to slice it, cut the section and show that view	test
audio_0_64229.wav	so this is my expression	test
audio_0_181758.wav	D for D or data flip flop and that is why I actually call this input as D ok	test
audio_0_146081.wav	This is what is meant by change of control flow, and such instructions are termed as control flow instructions	test
audio_0_163790.wav	Actually, you should have substantially reduced because they are repaying their loans compared to earlier years	test
audio_0_105012.wav	So, we know how the MOSFET looks like right	test
audio_0_163488.wav	The old phone might not be still unusable, but newer phone might give much better utilities that is why with better availability of either hardware or software one tends to replace the assets faster that is mainly because of obsolescence if you as a as observe carefully many of the apps either on our mobile or on computer, they need to be deleted or updated continuously because the older versions are no longer the best versions and the newer versions are available	test
audio_0_177450.wav	So we will use them for a given sinusoid that is VT is equal to VM COS omega T plus 5 and convert them into phaser form	test
audio_0_22325.wav	So once this is checked, that means the uhh assume number of bolts are okay, assume diameter of bolts are okay	test
audio_0_149923.wav	We will take the example of phenylketonuria little later	test
audio_0_19637.wav	And it should be visual, so that it does not require a lot of language to express what it is, is something that is the need of the hour	test
audio_0_134856.wav	With this let us see a formal definition of what a friend function is, “A friend function of a class has access to the private and protected members of the class	test
audio_0_126640.wav	And as we know the characteristics can be divided into 2 minimum regions, the triode or the linear region and the saturation region	test
audio_0_18732.wav	that does not sound right, maybe I have to do something to test whether they like it	test
audio_0_21432.wav	this is lv, and le is the distance between prying force and bolt center line, le, Distance of the prying force to bolt center line	test
audio_0_11576.wav	So, 2 i x plus V 0 by 4, but i x is equal to minus V 0 by 2 see, if you put i x is here minus V 0 by 2 minus V 0 by 2, then you will get the value of V 0, you can solve for V 0 that, what we have done next right	test
audio_0_67972.wav	so the wrong	test
audio_0_215298.wav	And you will get glitches, you will get (Refer Time: 06:59)	test
audio_0_181577.wav	So, now we as we have said we can connect this in two different ways; one with a common ground, another without a common ground	test
audio_0_8591.wav	So, because of this relationship we will say c is completely independent y	test
audio_0_102825.wav	If we were not going to be providing web shear reinforcement, we would still be okay	test
audio_0_21389.wav	that is proof	test
audio_0_179552.wav	So, it means that, if we have a function like e to the power minus a t into f t, the Laplace transform of that would be F into F of s plus a	test
audio_0_15225.wav	When that now there write up is there is just when the whatever I said when the transformer is loaded a current I 2 will flow in the secondary winding	test
audio_0_119454.wav	So, we have a set of quantum numbers n 1, n 2 and n 3 and they are used to define the energy of the electron	test
audio_0_167097.wav	So, the steps that we need to do to develop the schedule, the first thing to do is to choose the frame size and then we may not be always successful in the first attempt to get acceptable frame size	test
audio_0_130679.wav	But I think we sort of got there now	test
audio_0_130563.wav	As we see the rheology is very important, how can we come up with the new chemical admixtures that can control the workability of the CSA based cement	test
audio_0_135350.wav	The third parameter is little tricky, and right now you may not understand why the third parameter is required	test
audio_0_120359.wav	So, you can just plug in the numbers and the answer is 0	test
audio_0_49276.wav	We can change it later	test
audio_0_123322.wav	So, we need to find the ionization energy for the extra electron in the silicon lattice this extra electron is coming from the pentavalent impurity	test
audio_0_57761.wav	however, notice that i have already accounted for q one, q three in this term and q two, q three in the second term and therefore i have j equals four through n over r three, j and so on	test
audio_0_39784.wav	So, now, let us now this is the second order homogenous differential equation that we want to solve ok	test
audio_0_17818.wav	Books and Internet	test
audio_0_177817.wav	Free body diagram means you just take the main body of the element and show the forces applied on that particular body or mass	test
audio_0_109107.wav	Here you will see that, it allows the frequency from this onwards, the pass band is here and it does not allow the frequency below this particular range	test
audio_0_113840.wav	For example looking at this particular plot we can actually infer the sets which had incurred a high execution time	test
audio_0_1730.wav	And direction of the flux you will get the magnetic circuit the right hand rule I told you in the direction of the current you graph the your what you call coil and your thumb will put the your what you call the direction of the flux right	test
audio_0_46944.wav	The main idea is that these functions are not you cannot write them in closed form ok, but that does not mean we cannot numerically see what it looks like	test
audio_0_206077.wav	Pick the object place it in the natural position	test
audio_0_5830.wav	So, this is actually self inductance for this kind of coil	test
audio_0_75895.wav	So, total amount which we are returning back to the bank as a total effect of financing we have shown or the returning the loan we have shown is the 15,758	test
audio_0_114899.wav	So, note that the EAX register contains the pointer to the correct address of mylib int	test
audio_0_63205.wav	and for the dynamic net weighting they are modified and changed dynamically during placement iterations	test
audio_0_105134.wav	And we can diffuse the dopant in the window created and thus we have the source and drain	test
audio_0_71586.wav	so this is the basic idea behind the yoshimura kuh algorithm that analyze this zones	test
audio_0_111956.wav	Then the input offset current	test
audio_0_149375.wav	Now it goes to our unconscious state and because if you make a mix of the infantile state of memory the forgotten events and the subliminal experiences then this combination makes us too much varied from each other	test
audio_0_135371.wav	We are not talking about C++ string right now, which you already know has a comparison operator	test
audio_0_214011.wav	So, this is the way isometric view really looks like	test
audio_0_209198.wav	If we are getting that, we call first angle projection technique	test
audio_0_141598.wav	So, that is a typical style that we will often try to follow that, whenever we want to set some member, data member or may be at times get some data member even from within the member function of the class, we may want conceive whether we would directly set that or we will use some private member functions to set them	test
audio_0_148394.wav	This simple experiment actually shows you how we can switch ON and OFF a bulb or any circuit for certain duty cycle, and period in a PWM controlled fashion	test
audio_0_195153.wav	So this is only conductor that is being used throughout the railway electrification zone, so this is the conductor or overhead conductor that we use and whatever is the rail here that is supposed to be our return conductor	test
audio_0_106141.wav	In class 3 we are understanding the process to fabricate an integrated circuit	test
audio_0_123654.wav	So, e f i is e v plus e g over 2 minus 1 half kT ln of n c over n v	test
audio_0_31472.wav	Now there are many different kinds of things that can go wrong	test
audio_0_67524.wav	so let see for this example what will happen for this case	test
audio_0_99522.wav	A 34 meter high wall would be how many stories	test
audio_0_57551.wav	this mu zero cancels and you end up getting rho i square over two pi square a cubed and the direction of the pointing vector is into the volume, as you can easily see by taking e cross b	test
audio_0_37410.wav	So, I get lot of youngsters and kids are normally brought by parents and all that	test
audio_0_146489.wav	And then we will do some kind of operation to find out whether there is smoke inside the room or not	test
audio_0_57272.wav	this spherical element is given by r square time theta prime and d theta prime, d phi prime	test
audio_0_194529.wav	Now we are going to start actually on motors and generators	test
audio_0_208682.wav	So, in today's class we have learned about full section details, half section, offset section and revolve sections	test
audio_0_209612.wav	So, that p’ we will get and that projection supposed to be is 10 mm above it; that means, at 10 mm we have to mark a point somewhere here	test
audio_0_37652.wav	And, each kid will undergo to the same process in different context	test
audio_0_50593.wav	Here r m is chosen to be r 1	test
audio_0_106776.wav	This is how we can draw the equivalent circuit of the operational amplifier, this is how you can draw the equivalent circuit of ideal versus actual or real or practical op amp right, ideal or real or practical op amp easy, easy right	test
audio_0_111055.wav	Band Reject band reject is two frequencies FL FH right	test
audio_0_176113.wav	So, now what you will observe	test
audio_0_35650.wav	Whenever we have this kind of a thing where the same name is being updated, there is a short form where we can combine the operation with the assignment	test
audio_0_43125.wav	The only sort of a thing to remember about this hertz dipole it was a very very small current element and because it is very small, you can assume current is approximately constant thing right	test
audio_0_1579.wav	And this is your delta connected, it is your Z c, Z b, and Z a	test
audio_0_80696.wav	This will be the 5 units	test
audio_0_136322.wav	So, it is good to understand	test
audio_0_179069.wav	So since it is a second order equation you will get two roots of s	test
audio_0_125943.wav	So, from this discussion, this is a, let me write it down, power divider	test
audio_0_118626.wav	This is part a in part b, at what temperature is the donor 1 percent ionized and where is the fermi level located at this temperature	test
audio_0_35179.wav	We will not get into that, but the main point is that there is no mention here about the intermediate names, it is just taking the parameters passed to the function and inductive or recursive calls and how to combine them	test
audio_0_147161.wav	This says that we have to include mbed library mbed	test
audio_0_184309.wav	And, this 1 degree will correspond to a high relative error say because say this position R X is R X is equal to 3 30 ohm is say here at 10 degree	test
audio_0_143546.wav	So, the IPM cell also takes care of that, it has to be regularly filed, so that responsibility falls on the IPM cell as well	test
audio_0_15289.wav	Similar by similar way that reactance also can be transferred to that, so X 2 dash also will be K square into X 2, right	test
audio_0_172424.wav	That means for a balanced system we generally know that the phases are equally upon equally distant with respect to each other that is 120 degree apart from each other	test
audio_0_162643.wav	Let us start our next module 3	test
audio_0_118742.wav	So, intrinsic semiconductors or pure semiconductors are essentially single crystals; we say that there are no defects in the semiconductor, because these defects can again create electrons and holes of their own	test
audio_0_198330.wav	If the speed increases originally I had K omega phi, Phi has decreased now the speed will hit that value such that K phi omega comes back to its original condition	test
audio_0_16000.wav	3 so, but here by you know while writing is it has been made 0	test
audio_0_107310.wav	The beta; beta equals to 1 by 3 in case of Wein bridge oscillator and my gain is 3 or if I write greater than equal to 3, then beta equals to 3 by 9; my gain would be greater than equal to 9	test
audio_0_47335.wav	Now, you are abstracted the idea for dot product from vectors to functions and you can talk about orthogonality right	test
audio_0_104584.wav	So, if we see input signal 0 degree, 180 degree phase shift because inverting amplifier, so 180 degree part of output is feedback to the input	test
audio_0_213892.wav	Once it is done, already T point we know; so locate that point, intersect this already constructed circuit	test
audio_0_150661.wav	Now line to cable transmission factor that is refraction coefficient for voltage, we know that tau V 1 that it will it is actually 2 Z 2 upon Z 1 plus Z 2 this we have seen earlier	test
audio_0_104362.wav	So we are looking at a wall that is initially straight, subjected to eccentric loading and examine the deflections in the wall due to this eccentric loading and see if those deflections are actually going to compromise the force capacity, the strength capacity of the wall itself	test
audio_0_149843.wav	All of this methods are extensively used all of them, and as discussed towards the end they have their advantages and they have their limitations	test
audio_0_52837.wav	We will just have a look at the voltage waveforms too to understand what is happening to the voltage ratings of the converter	test
audio_0_170727.wav	And therefore, food is a means of communication which among other things can also convey the status we want to communicate our attitude towards other people by the manner in which we order and we select our food items	test
audio_0_198039.wav	So, both these machines are generally tough competitors in many cases because the efficiency is really, really better	test
audio_0_141892.wav	So, its kinds of subsidizes the it is like the successful technology subsidizing the ones that do not become successful	test
audio_0_120673.wav	Let us look at some typical values for resistivity for all these three types	test
audio_0_194644.wav	So you would see that B itself will be carrying dot current and cross current and so on and so forth	test
audio_0_175711.wav	So, when you have dependent source available in the circuit which you cannot remove you will first remove all the independent sources and then apply voltage v naught and try to measure the current i naught and accordingly you can find out the value of Thevenin resistance	test
audio_0_73329.wav	so mostly of predict that this curve will be a straight line	test
audio_0_127401.wav	So, it lost its significance at that time	test
audio_0_71907.wav	ok, later on, if you move on the flip flopping, as i said, flip flops are typically activated by the edge of the clock, either the rising or the falling edge	test
audio_0_169105.wav	And we really have to think differently about expectations around timing	test
audio_0_141280.wav	And finally, I would advice that in module 18 when we started, we started with a motivation of building complete types, complete algebra for variety of different arithmetical types and others, so a complex number, fractions, string, vector matrices and so on	test
audio_0_208289.wav	So, equilateral triangle every time we have to construct, assemble it in such a way that, it makes a closed object such kind of thing what we call as this octahedron	test
audio_0_170234.wav	The primary reason for taking up these studies is based on this idea that our accessories symbolize our sense of self respect	test
audio_0_108337.wav	we will see, b But that does not mean that voltage and current have linear relationship	test
audio_0_114222.wav	So, over here on this part of the slide shows the assembly code for scan without canaries enabled	test
audio_0_114958.wav	When we actually normally look at a machine or a system, we see that there are a multiple layer of hardware, there are VM’s, operating systems and above that the application	test
audio_0_123217.wav	The schottky barrier height depends upon the difference between the work function of the metal and the electron affinity of the semiconductor	test
audio_0_63430.wav	so what might happen is that in a point x the clock signal might be like this	test
audio_0_105557.wav	But if you if you take operational amplifier which is a practical op amp, right	test
audio_0_34501.wav	Then we introduce a new type of value, which may not be so familiar for logical values true and false which are of type bool	test
audio_0_82784.wav	The income statement which we prepared in the second second problem that was the profit and loss account and that was a part of the financial accounting	test
audio_0_146627.wav	Next let us talk about smoke sensing	test
audio_0_42872.wav	So, I am going to assume the electric field at the start of the delta t remains the same for the delta t right	test
audio_0_153534.wav	So, now suppose ah suppose you have this is your sending end and this is your receiving end right and your this is your what you call that shunt capacitor is connected Q c; j I have not shown here every time, but understandable and this is the Q load right	test
audio_0_150745.wav	2 and into 50, but around that around that value it will be there right	test
audio_0_89139.wav	after thirty minutes, you fill them with the plating medium the job is done and put it back into the co two incubator	test
audio_0_6465.wav	So, after getting this when v is equal to 3 volt you solve the circuit, you will get i 0 is equal to 3 by 28 ampere right	test
audio_0_110569.wav	So, immaterial or whatever feedback you get always learn something from that and try to improve right	test
audio_0_168136.wav	In the ensuing video we look further at certain illustrations and associations of commonly found finger gestures	test
audio_0_103500.wav	You have single leaf constructions, what we saw earlier in terms of the Flemish bond and the English bond are single leaf constructions	test
audio_0_146940.wav	What it can do basically it can measure the static acceleration due to gravity in tilt sensing applications as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock or vibration	test
audio_0_37196.wav	Because people have human mind as huge resilience, otherwise if you look at the society often you will wonder how do people live in such scholar, poverty with so many problems, but most people are living	test
audio_0_63752.wav	now, depending on the scenario, depending on your priorities, the objective criteria may be different	test
audio_0_166789.wav	Otherwise even if the resource is unused still it will not be allowed access to the resource and we say that it undergoes avoidance related inversion	test
audio_0_36638.wav	Remember when you are doing print, you are actually printing a string	test

audio_0_103493.wav	If you come to modern constructions the whole concept of coarsed masonry and having a pattern is something that you would have definitely learned in your earlier classes in materials	test
audio_0_75677.wav	So you if you want to change his mind set on the Samsung to Videocon you have to make numerous efforts, is it possible to make that much of the efforts and convince the customer number 1, second thing is this then only 30% will be available to you, second thing is that you have to keep the product and for example this product is 6 months old there is a risk of the option is also, product coming today from the company, product coming 6 months back from the company, you are keeping in your warehouse in your gudown	test
audio_0_136567.wav	In the remaining part we would briefly discuss what is known as the State of an Object	test
audio_0_116050.wav	It is important for us to be able to understand C and C++ program binaries	test
audio_0_102518.wav	But what's important is as far as this criterion is concerned we have to examine the shear strength coming from only the compressed zone of the wall which means part of the wall has already cracked and that may be tensile heel cracking right we are talking of mixed modes, it's not like right from the beginning you are going to have shear sliding occurring in the wall	test
audio_0_208660.wav	And, the places where the larger portions we did not remove any material that portion will be left blank	test
audio_0_101605.wav	So, we are using the estimate of the curvature at the cracked stage when the initiation of crack occurs, use that to proportion the curvature in the wall itself	test
audio_0_129416.wav	This is again information that we will require for the life cycle assessment, electricity required, fuel consumption	test
audio_0_124536.wav	But what about a 2 port microwave device	test
audio_0_2706.wav	But I a lags I b by 120 degree, we know that, but I b lags 120 degree, simply substitute I b is equal to I a minus 120 degree, you put it here and you simplify, if you simplify you will get, I a is equal to V p upon root 3 divided by angle minus 30 degree by Z y	test
audio_0_46015.wav	So, just the length of the segment will come	test

audio_0_61126.wav	e is equal to e transmitted	test
audio_0_159404.wav	Actually, if you look at the amount, they have not increased much, but because of the fall in the revenue, they could not reduce their expenses like the fall in the revenue that's why as a percentage they have gone up so this is one way of interpreting it employee benefit as a percentage has slightly gone up depreciation as a percentage has slightly gone up so various figures now you can get it as a percent	test
audio_0_171673.wav	In second case when suppose theta v minus theta i is the difference of angles is 90 degree that may be positive or negative	test
audio_0_55564.wav	The inductance L and the voltage across the inductance VL and the current I which is flowing through the inductor are related by the Faraday's law	test
audio_0_36591.wav	As I said this is not, I mean, required you could easily define a range function which does the natural thing which is i, i plus 1 up to j, but then you have to keep remembering to put a minus 1 whenever you want the indices to stop with the correct place	test
audio_0_1841.wav	And if you take the magnetizing m call magnetizing reactance right x m then you will see that I0 is purely I mean loss is neglected then this I0 and ∅ both are in phase and lagging from V1 / 90 degree	test

audio_0_185924.wav	So, if I call this voltage across the meter as V m, so, which is between these two points ok	test
audio_0_96002.wav	So if you are using algorithm methods, so far as experience of some what code or experience of some tester, it cannot be easily quantified	test
audio_0_120183.wav	So, at 0 kelvin, you have a valence band that is completely full and a conduction band that is completely empty at any temperature above 0 kelvin	test
audio_0_65467.wav	now suppose this one of this lines i can move it to here from here, like this	test
audio_0_148728.wav	We would be looking at the psychoanalytic frame work, where in we would talk about the proposition a Freud, Erikson, Jung, Adler and of course, Karen Horney	test
audio_0_59195.wav	this fellow would have moved only ten fifteenth of that, one centimeter, and that means point six, seven centimeters	test
audio_0_57321.wav	so we can write this: r square over four pi	test
audio_0_150288.wav	So, there are ways and means of classifying the responses and based on these responses then the psychologist tries to identify the complexes and Jung says that along with psychological complexes you can find out the intellectual and the emotional deficiency of the individual based on word association test	test
audio_0_41261.wav	So, what should I get	test
audio_0_36531.wav	So, this function append for instance modifies the value of the name fn to a new name which takes the old name and sticks an i at the end of it	test
audio_0_100345.wav	You will appreciate the fact given these differences that exist between the different test methods that really there is no consensus in the scientific community on one single test that characterizes either the joint shear strength or the sheer strength of masonry	test
audio_0_215925.wav	In the first case the functioning is explained as a text while in the second case it is explained along with an audio narration without a text	test
audio_0_158259.wav	They usually do not show the tendency of making chunks of three or making chunks of four but gradually with a little more experience we all start doing that children start doing that but even though we might have grown up if you take adults who are not say chess players and compare with say chess master you would realize that chess masters have much better memory and they use span of memory like anything because they have to retain a series of moves so you need a very good you know storage system that helps you recollect what was the step that your opponents had taken in a series and this will help you anticipate what could be the probable movement of your opponent if you make this type of move	test
audio_0_126998.wav	Then I have another definition which is called GA which is so this is my once again this is my network in the top GA is given as power available from the network upon power available from source so this is equal to PAVN upon PAVS	test

audio_0_192872.wav	Whereas, the non magnetic materials like air or wood or any of them will not allow the magnetic field lines to pass through so easily; which means if I have to have probably the magnetism produced in the coils here in the stator and ultimately, I have to induce electricity in the conductors here	test
audio_0_69069.wav	so lets go to that example	test
audio_0_17536.wav	Your name	test
audio_0_16127.wav	So, V by 25 plus V by 50 is equal to 1 plus 3 by 2 your i x, but question is this i x is given actually this is your i x	test
audio_0_127367.wav	So, you do not form corrosion products right on top of the anode and therefore anode continues to corrode	test
audio_0_130796.wav	And also for motor test, we used to have this 40 mm cross 160 mm prism specimens for the continuous monitoring of carbonation depth	test
audio_0_182368.wav	Because this was the original circuit original circuit and here the current was flowing like this it was flowing for both positive and negative halves	test
audio_0_72391.wav	so now a zero is selected	test
audio_0_118099.wav	As we discussed in the previous video, one thing that was quite characteristic of every hardware Trojan is that it is small, typically a few lines of code occupying a very less area in the entire design of the IC and secondly it is stealthy, stealthy means that it is mostly passive during the normal working of the device or the IC as well as during most of the testing process the Trojan is a passive and inactive and the Trojan only gets activated when specific triggers are obtained	test
audio_0_172629.wav	Basically, the state diagram is constructed following all rules of signal flow graph which we have seen till now using Laplace transformed state equation	test

audio_0_196961.wav	I am going to have I by 2 flowing here and I by 2 flowing here, right	test
audio_0_141617.wav	So, this is where you write the code to search and then you actually make the call and that is how you should go ahead with doing design and as you go ahead your finding that I said that I will not give you the details of the helper classes because their interfaces, their member functions will kind of get derived from your design because we have just seen this requirement for an address book	test
audio_0_146787.wav	Next the function readsms	test
audio_0_33737.wav	5 8 queens dot py	test
audio_0_33579.wav	So, we would initially start with an empty board and with row 0	test

audio_0_68442.wav	well, you can ask that: how do i know these values	test
audio_0_8517.wav	But geometric mean of L 1 L 2 less than the arithmetic mean of L 1 L 2 if they are not equal	test
audio_0_4713.wav	So, if you do so, if you do so, if you write, if you write KVL here look, how you are write it	test
audio_0_44112.wav	So, let us formally these integral equations	test
audio_0_64695.wav	that means this, this, this internetwork tree, what we are drawing	test
audio_0_48966.wav	So, now, let us start with as with any problem in computational em we start with Maxwell’s equations right, at the end of this course you will be amazed that how every problem we just start with these two or four equations and we get a solution ok	test
audio_0_85220.wav	We use the three category of the workers	test
audio_0_137142.wav	So, now if we look into the application code here, we are constructing two such objects object 1 and object 2, as you can see that my class does not have any constructor	test
audio_0_14010.wav	If you miss the minus sign or plus sign if something goes wrong, then your technique your numerical value numerical value may remain same, but the sign ah will create problem	test
audio_0_78194.wav	And if the buying price is lesser as compared to the manufacturing price, so we can easily take a decision in favor of buying it ready made from the market rather than manufacturing it	test
audio_0_199869.wav	And by definition whatever equivalent we come up with will be linear because we will be neglecting all the higher order terms	test
audio_0_76729.wav	So, payment will be for how much	test
audio_0_65262.wav	this is something which is called useful skew	test
audio_0_52881.wav	So this has come basically from the relationship L is equal to lambda n square	test
audio_0_83804.wav	So, by dividing the cost into total cost into variable and fixed cost, we move step by step in this case	test
audio_0_39137.wav	On other hand in case of full duplex we have separate transmission and receiving time lines	test
audio_0_67139.wav	pitch means in a particular ah area or within a particular length means how many lines you can draw	test
audio_0_132972.wav	Here we have a scope it is a declarative region, within which I can have variety of different identifiers, variety of different symbols	test

audio_0_190422.wav	The curve which is corresponding to OP that represents the initial condition	test
audio_0_110517.wav	So, if I just say, ideally the term Acm into Vcm should not be there and Vo should be nothing but just Ad into Vd; this is the ideal situation	test
audio_0_130719.wav	Department must take a view on how this should be divided but also it is a question of whether we should be saying to our graduating students and to young practitioners, listen, what you have got now is just the ticket out the door	test
audio_0_13716.wav	So, once you have to find out short circuit current, another is you have to find out the your ah in 1 and 2 ah Norton equivalent circuit right	test
audio_0_45067.wav	Some function in space separating them	test
audio_0_38021.wav	If there is no physical illness, I am not talking of somebody is having a seizure or a congenital problem	test
