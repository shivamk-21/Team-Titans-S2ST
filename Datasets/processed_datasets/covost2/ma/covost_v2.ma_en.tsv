path	translation	split
audio_0_125111.wav	but now we will run into a contradiction, because lets assume that the inputs of op a one are virtually shorted, so that means the non inverting input is zero volts	train
audio_0_37346.wav	So, you see the challenge now	train
audio_0_183442.wav	If I were to focus on the system design aspects the two parameters which we have already referred to in terms of their impact on the system: one is going to be the number of fades per second	train
audio_0_196654.wav	But whereas I can do this, I can apply VGS and this and this ID will flow	train
audio_0_5395.wav	So, if you have any doubt you can put all that questions in the forum I will give you the answer right	train
audio_0_188677.wav	So, you see that depending on what type of inequality these different things can happen	train
audio_0_169557.wav	So, that is in phasor form, but in magnitude form, since, we have same amplitude will get Van equal to the model of Van equal to mod of Vbn equal to mod of Vcn so, what we can say now, the balanced phase voltages are equal in magnitude, but are out of phase with each other by 120 degree	train
audio_0_48401.wav	next we solve problem two, which says a solid, infinitely long cylinder has axis along the z axis	train
audio_0_172822.wav	That is another possibility	train
audio_0_136113.wav	Huggan’s own Book, Interdisciplinary Measures, provides precisely such an attempt, to make an argument, for the value of Literature, in conceiving Ethical action	train
audio_0_93335.wav	you see the last sentence: nokia has introduced new plans in its corporate social responsibility unit	train
audio_0_236797.wav	Or, maybe thrice, is fine	train
audio_0_229925.wav	So, it is desirable to describe both the operation; that means, to say rather than saying please give me that x instrument, you say that is say so, here is a part in which is manufactured and this undergoes these these these operations and this is what is the criticality of this part in terms of performance	train
audio_0_142625.wav	There was a very strong relationship with Enron and political parties	train
audio_0_40625.wav	So, in this exponential I mean this incident and reflected fields, the y term will just cancel off right yeah	train
audio_0_36293.wav	But at least in the recent modern history, you start with the Kepler who everyone is heard of and he used a sort of not calculus, but something predating calculus a very elementary sort of math to predict how planets moved	train
audio_0_38878.wav	See notice that, in almost not almost in every single new method that we come across, we always just start from Maxwell’s equations and either take it through a differential route or a integral route and then different methods come from them	train
audio_0_230727.wav	So now with four gauge blocks so, gauge 4 gauge 3 gauge 2 and gauge 1 I could built a this is 23	train
audio_0_230496.wav	So now, we have gone into a measurement of vacuum	train
audio_0_83296.wav	And here if I want to understand then Ii would be equal to I1 right	train
audio_0_99570.wav	So, let us just try to do this, this is the same construction	train
audio_0_235455.wav	We have already discussed this, in a previous lecture	train
audio_0_220116.wav	Then, we will keep k prime as a name of the final set	train
audio_0_13879.wav	61 degree right, because it is if, you take it is this thing it is r plus j L Omega right, this is the impedance of that your inductor	train
audio_0_74226.wav	What I have drawn here is the filament and this is the integrin connection	train
audio_0_208604.wav	So, first of all, draw a directrix AB and the dimensions what we are going to follow is focus from this C point supposed to be 70 and eccentricity ratio is 3 by 4	train
audio_0_176564.wav	From the literature we find the following words are used	train
audio_0_223176.wav	So, a partition is A 1, A 2, sums of the frequencies in each other sets are roughly equal, solve them recursively	train
audio_0_106304.wav	The patent system actually incentivizes people to take risky tasks like spending time, effort and money in developing inventions	train
audio_0_183936.wav	So, a lot of system information system information has to be transmitted to that you can then synchronize with that it also tells you what is the PN sequence, basically it will tell you what is the PN sequence information it will provide	train
audio_0_203959.wav	So, one we need to we need the symmetry plane about which the our limits has to have to be symmetric about	train
audio_0_64826.wav	so here you see	train
audio_0_227189.wav	6 mm, you can see this if this is a feeler gauge one of the leaf of the feeler gauge I am trying to put it in it is not going properly	train
audio_0_33299.wav	So, I want an approximation for second order derivative, so if I add these two equations	train
audio_0_78961.wav	For immune surveillance, so your immune cells need to reach out to all corners of the body they should have special mechanisms to be go through the basement membrane	train
audio_0_99733.wav	This is just shows with the example as to how your bound set data type will work	train
audio_0_211563.wav	ok, so, and in fact, the data sheet, we will tell you nicely: ah, all these data, in fact all these numbers that i am putting out here, or actually from data sheets, right, so the whole design can, if you have the idea, right, ah, rest of the thing can actually come out from the data sheet itself	train
audio_0_131361.wav	if we do exercise, it would be a good exercise that do not consider any feed water heating	train
audio_0_163434.wav	286 centimeter and it is b is 0	train
audio_0_157421.wav	While the inner index can be a dense primary index	train
audio_0_115762.wav	so here the infrastructure is the hard, data center infrastructure, the other come	train
audio_0_169064.wav	Now since the convolution is commutative it is sometimes more convenient to apply step one and two to xt instead of ht	train
audio_0_195083.wav	So, this is equal to whatever VDS you need	train
audio_0_180668.wav	So, the question that arises is, is there a way to map the Ricean distribution to the Nakagami m and it turns out that yes there is a way to do that	train
audio_0_166882.wav	Or you can write ZL is equal to RL plus jXL is equal to Rth minus jXth	train
audio_0_76668.wav	So, you still have 2 cases; B because wherever your tip touches the protein you are bound to have A B A B sequences in between ok	train
audio_0_109116.wav	So, the law originated in England and it was followed around the world similar versions of the law	train
audio_0_209308.wav	In the last class, we have introduced the special curves, namely cycloid, a spiral, an involute and a helix and we stopped to learn about these construction in the next class	train
audio_0_144238.wav	Now we will come to INDS	train
audio_0_179490.wav	Now, you are going to maximum this capacity over all possible power allocation schemes	train
audio_0_76069.wav	In the last class we are started discussing about differences in the type of focal adhesions that you might observe in cells and what drives their assembly	train
audio_0_204268.wav	Then it will ensure the pin to remain in the slot its only	train
audio_0_178173.wav	It will be F2 minus 1 times Ni and 3 by G3 will be F3 minus 1 times Ni	train
audio_0_215807.wav	it is used for storing, used for storing, ah, the unique, unique id of this chip	train
audio_0_93232.wav	and when we talk about all these things, we at times find that there are situations when we actually, because we have been communicating day in and day out, speaking, writing, and then there are certain occasions where we feel ourselves a bit confused	train
audio_0_189530.wav	In the previous lectures, we have seen how to create data frames, How to access rows and columns of data frames, How to add rows and columns to existing data frame	train
audio_0_36777.wav	So, for example, what are we doing we are imposing that the reflection go to 0 at 1 angle a second order boundary condition will allow you to make the reflection go to 0 at 2 angles, 3rd order will allow you to do it at 3 angles and so on	train
audio_0_133580.wav	Physiological needs basically include hunger, thirst, sex and sleep	train
audio_0_231031.wav	See if you want to automate a process, you should have a measurement device which requires the measured discrepancy between the actual and the desired performance	train
audio_0_24426.wav	Basically in terms of research towards how something like this would work for the target market which are students, we have gone ahead and done some focus group research and interviews basically most of them either just who were passed out from school or currently in school	train
audio_0_229020.wav	So, for the np charts, each point in the chart is given by a value node denoted by D i which is the number of nonconforming units maybe of the I th sample, ok	train
audio_0_131079.wav	so thats why the what sensible comes from, and as a temperature rises, definitely the internal energy of thats, of that body, of that system, or whatever we are heating up, increases	train
audio_0_175498.wav	That means engineering subjects are somehow purged out of engineering programs and they have become dominantly engineering science programs	train
audio_0_157955.wav	This is the read right head of the disc that moves back and forth across the surface of a track radially	train
audio_0_144646.wav	From trial balance, students are taught to prepare P&L and balance sheet	train
audio_0_18933.wav	Initial voltage is given right; that is V C 0	train
audio_0_215619.wav	so the magnetic field is what is shown in the dotted part	train
audio_0_131186.wav	a mathematical condition is there is a bio number which should be less than point one, but physically what it means is that there is no spatial variation across the body that we are analyzing for transient cooling	train
audio_0_131236.wav	the same entropy value will be there at state point two	train
audio_0_15418.wav	So; however, I have measurement must be communicated in a standard language, such that all engineering professionals can understand irrespective of the country where the measurement is conducted such an international measurement language is the international system units	train
audio_0_61457.wav	but what i am saying is that, depending on the layers in which this blocks are, there can be several constraints, like, of course, design rule constraint says that you have to have some minimum width of this lines	train
audio_0_148913.wav	Twitter allows you to change as many numbers of times as possible that is the reason why this problem is actually appearing	train
audio_0_36456.wav	The direction of different from the	train
audio_0_82065.wav	So now, if you can focus here, you see, you can change the voltage from 0 from 0 to 230 volts, it is connected to where	train
audio_0_223348.wav	So, our goal is to show that k in fact is the same as m, in other words the optimum solution is of the same size as the solution that the greedy strategy produces	train
audio_0_228398.wav	So, let us try to do this again, to it has come here, we did not change the A 0 and B 0 you know A 0 and B 0 was to be kept	train
audio_0_185747.wav	The distance metric could be Euclidean distance, Mahalanabis distance, Hamming distance and so on	train
audio_0_80744.wav	A high pass filter is a filter that significantly attenuates or rejects all the frequencies below f c below f c and passes all frequencies above f c	train
audio_0_32144.wav	So, you all agree that this visualization that I have shown you over here like a tent with height 1 at node 1 and 0 by the time it reaches node 2 3 and the line connecting 2 3	train
audio_0_162726.wav	So, it is not intercepting all the rays	train
audio_0_5516.wav	For parallel, we are plotting admittance versus omega	train
audio_0_34281.wav	Now look at think of your FDTD update equations, you have curl of E is dB/dt, curl of h is dD/dt and if you have variable is let us say total field, where will you introduce the incident field	train
audio_0_227208.wav	So, this is a feeler gauge feeler gauge is also be used on the surface plate to see if there is a gap if there is the flatness or not, for instance when I will use the height gauge we will try to insert the thinnest of the feeler leaf between the base of the height gauge and the top surface of our surface plate only	train
audio_0_194354.wav	So, definition of remember prime means if a product of two elements is an I 1 of them is an I	train
audio_0_198536.wav	It's a simple system of linear equations	train
audio_0_225567.wav	So, it keeps trying edges from smallest to largest and for every edge if it can add the edge without violating a tree property, it adds it	train
audio_0_176479.wav	So leave the purpose	train
audio_0_139864.wav	So, it is coming down slowly, you know sometimes when you have vertical coming down etcetera underweight you want that coming going up is, can be fast but going down has to be at a low force	train
audio_0_4465.wav	Because, peak value is given 100 volts right and it is; that means, V t is equal to V 0 plus V m sin omega t	train
audio_0_171459.wav	If you take the integral of theta m double dot, you will get theta m dot, which is nothing but x3	train
audio_0_43799.wav	So, based on the observer only sees outgoing wave right, so implies a is equal to 0 right, a is equal to 0 guarantees at the solution is purely outgoing	train
audio_0_165649.wav	So we can in this way we can eliminate the i1 from the equation	train
audio_0_9009.wav	So, v 1 is equal to we can write they will chain rule N 1 into d phi 1 upon d i1 into d i1 upon d t this you can write L 1 into d i1 upon d t	train
audio_0_190514.wav	So, R is a ring	train
audio_0_219552.wav	So, in other words while I’m just keeping two columns or two rows, I can completely compute this thing back to 0 0	train
audio_0_186505.wav	So, in this table we have distance one, which is the distance from the point 1 1 and we have distance two, which is the distance from the point 3 3	train
audio_0_130825.wav	so this is again ts diagram and ah	train
audio_0_42002.wav	So, the curl is something that measures how much a vector field is swirling	train
audio_0_239785.wav	The organizations are influenced, by a lot of things, in their environments	train
audio_0_221130.wav	So, in this unit we are going to look at searching and sorting for a value in a list of values	train
audio_0_92517.wav	So, we have already discussed the convergence of Fourier series and now this is a continuation of that lecture, where we will consider different kind of convergences	train
audio_0_139282.wav	PID controllers are used, sometimes with various special configurations for anti wind up for bump less transfer etc	train
audio_0_107265.wav	So, you treat foreigners as equals when they are within your territory	train
audio_0_165757.wav	So let us start the discussion of today’s session	train
audio_0_186317.wav	So, you have n is equal to 5 it will keep it in memory	train
audio_0_92196.wav	So, what we will observe in the examples, in some cases when the parametric equation is easily available or given in the problem, then we can apply this form here, in the vector form	train
audio_0_21135.wav	Let us move to cost accounting now with this discussion	train
audio_0_125111.wav	but now we will run into a contradiction, because lets assume that the inputs of op a one are virtually shorted, so that means the non inverting input is zero volts	train
audio_0_37346.wav	So, you see the challenge now	train
audio_0_183442.wav	If I were to focus on the system design aspects the two parameters which we have already referred to in terms of their impact on the system: one is going to be the number of fades per second	train
audio_0_196654.wav	But whereas I can do this, I can apply VGS and this and this ID will flow	train
audio_0_5395.wav	So, if you have any doubt you can put all that questions in the forum I will give you the answer right	train
audio_0_188677.wav	So, you see that depending on what type of inequality these different things can happen	train
audio_0_169557.wav	So, that is in phasor form, but in magnitude form, since, we have same amplitude will get Van equal to the model of Van equal to mod of Vbn equal to mod of Vcn so, what we can say now, the balanced phase voltages are equal in magnitude, but are out of phase with each other by 120 degree	train
audio_0_48401.wav	next we solve problem two, which says a solid, infinitely long cylinder has axis along the z axis	train
audio_0_172822.wav	That is another possibility	train
audio_0_136113.wav	Huggan’s own Book, Interdisciplinary Measures, provides precisely such an attempt, to make an argument, for the value of Literature, in conceiving Ethical action	train
audio_0_93335.wav	you see the last sentence: nokia has introduced new plans in its corporate social responsibility unit	train
audio_0_236797.wav	Or, maybe thrice, is fine	train
audio_0_229925.wav	So, it is desirable to describe both the operation; that means, to say rather than saying please give me that x instrument, you say that is say so, here is a part in which is manufactured and this undergoes these these these operations and this is what is the criticality of this part in terms of performance	train
audio_0_142625.wav	There was a very strong relationship with Enron and political parties	train
audio_0_40625.wav	So, in this exponential I mean this incident and reflected fields, the y term will just cancel off right yeah	train
audio_0_36293.wav	But at least in the recent modern history, you start with the Kepler who everyone is heard of and he used a sort of not calculus, but something predating calculus a very elementary sort of math to predict how planets moved	train

audio_0_207443.wav	Though you would like to go in the clockwise, but your arc always be taking in the counterclockwise direction	train
audio_0_32801.wav	And so, from here I can get k prime as a square root of this expression square root of a complex number is going to give me a complex number ok	train
audio_0_214324.wav	so i will say: denser designs, denser designs for a given size, for a given size, for a given size, and thus allows, allows higher bus speeds, ok	train
audio_0_82327.wav	And we I do not want to show you the same circuit on the breadboard or because now I am sure that you are able to perform the experiments by yourself	train
audio_0_194510.wav	So in fact, more generally let n be a positive integer, then nZ is a prime ideal if and only if n is a prime number, this is what I want to prove now	train
audio_0_178777.wav	So, let us say that this is our scheme, we are trying to do co phasing r optimum of t is equal to summation k equal to 1 through M G k r k of t	train

audio_0_193412.wav	One more definition, we say that two elements a, b in R	train
audio_0_152273.wav	Many malicious accounts were created	train
audio_0_20951.wav	Charge it in the relevant proportion	train
audio_0_161435.wav	And we studied about hashing, static hashing and dynamic hashing and some tree based indexing	train
audio_0_79929.wav	So, from here R 11 and C 1 required for high pass stage to give a cut off frequency of 1 kilo hertz orare 10 kilo ohm and 5015 nano farad, whereile R 2, C 2 for a low pass filter isof cut off frequency of 30 kilo hertz andare 10 kilo ohm and 510 pico farad, right	train
audio_0_13766.wav	And I told you i 2 is leading this angle by your this thing what you call ah this i 1 by 60 degree, right	train
audio_0_73537.wav	So here similarly, you break the project activities into smaller and smaller components, then stop when you get to what to be done by one person in one or two weeks	train
audio_0_219485.wav	This also happens when you type queries in search engines	train
audio_0_457.wav	If I f is constant means the flux is constant right therefore, E b 0 by E b 1 you can write phi 0, n 0 upon phi 1 n 1	train
audio_0_15060.wav	So, in this case what will happen the by this method	train
audio_0_119703.wav	so this is row oriented data and this is column oriented and we need to have a join index which allows this data to be ah, linked to one another	train
audio_0_8948.wav	So, ah these are the current i 2 i 1 and your i 3 and i 4, right	train
audio_0_169001.wav	Similarly if you are convolving with the delta t minus t not that is time shift impulse function so you will get the output as ft minus t not, if you are taking the convolution of ft with the derivative of unit impulse you will get the output as derivative of function ft	train
audio_0_58969.wav	test generation means, given a circuit, i want to find out what are the inputs i need to apply to the circuit so that i can test it in the way i want	train
audio_0_157761.wav	That means A's must be restored to the previous value	train
audio_0_82508.wav	So, let us do one more example and then, we will finish this particular module and we continue in a next module of the same lecture	train
audio_0_202854.wav	These curves can be arbitrary also	train
audio_0_210570.wav	So, usually these 10 mm threads always be having something like a head portion, there is a stud portion, there are some threads some hexagonal kind of structures we will be having	train
audio_0_223748.wav	So, O i is not the number of hours overtime, so O i is the number of carpets	train
audio_0_147752.wav	Then, going to the node which is being overlapped with the other and dragging it just a little further off	train
audio_0_40554.wav	The only little bit of cleverness I did is I chose my testing functions nicely	train
audio_0_165563.wav	So, we close our this particular topic where we discuss about the State variable analysis	train
audio_0_41912.wav	So, the mid frequency range has wave like solutions ok	train
audio_0_213082.wav	point three: but this loading, when there are different loads being connected, when the output of the ah buck convertor is connected to the load, which could include a micro controller or it could include the radio, it could include sensors all of that ah, um and there are other power guzzling power consuming components, it will ensure the electronics there will have to work under the constraint that this input will never go below seven hundred millivolt	train
audio_0_225651.wav	So, each update of the component, each merging components that it is order n time and this itself happens n minus 1 times	train
audio_0_111864.wav	So, by this we can do find out the any S parameter	train
audio_0_101934.wav	One point to note at this, here in this terms of the built in or predefined types, you may note that notionally all types in C++ are assumed to have constructor or destructor	train
audio_0_169562.wav	So, in this module also the voltage and current we will consider in RMS values or otherwise stated in the particular discussion	train
audio_0_59382.wav	so what is manhattan distance	train
audio_0_166492.wav	So what you can do, you can find out the value of current I1	train
audio_0_162879.wav	So, you see this is the a thing if you compare, already we will see that the planes	train
audio_0_33270.wav	So, the stability criteria that we will look at is something very simple	train
audio_0_180534.wav	The signal is fluctuating I can set a nominal level Eb by N naught, but the actual the what I am actually going to be seeing it will going to be alpha squared Eb by N naught	train
audio_0_78185.wav	So, let us say this is some distance moved and this is time	train
audio_0_7796.wav	So, in this chapter you concentrate only linear circuit and theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to non linear circuits so, let me clear it right	train
audio_0_73834.wav	So, let us look at how it looks under normal functions	train
audio_0_173487.wav	Now, what we will look at is an assignment	train
audio_0_217029.wav	so that's another important point to be noted, that if you byte teg from manufacturer a, manufacturer a also note that power conditioning ah from another manufacturer, manufacturer b, you have to take care that the source resistances and the i c resistance, the input resistance of the i c, both of them are matched in a manner that you will be able to extract the output voltage	train
audio_0_52749.wav	so y not z not is zero	train
audio_0_189401.wav	Now once this command is run, its going to save it in an object called crash test underscore 1 which is a data frame	train
audio_0_43990.wav	Those are tangential edges right	train
audio_0_28886.wav	So, we say that this is 4 not because we did plus 3 because s is not equal to b, we did 4 because we got the max value from here, why is this 4 again i is not equal to s	train
audio_0_11236.wav	So, once again i am writing for you V is equal to V m by root 2	train
audio_0_187030.wav	So, we are doing the same thing beta naught hat plus or minus 2	train
audio_0_73052.wav	So, again, for the project one I am calculating the NPV	train
audio_0_34403.wav	So, dl is starting from a large number and decreasing	train
audio_0_162588.wav	It is a reflection coefficient of the surface for the polarization of the wave because you know that when the wave come from any surface there will be a reflection, so it is there	train
audio_0_60542.wav	sixty percent here, thirty percent here and ten percent	train
audio_0_116794.wav	so inside the v m, so as you can see the, from inside the v m, we can access internet and it is as usual, like any other machine	train
audio_0_125113.wav	so the voltage of this point is v test times r one by r one plus r two	train
audio_0_83094.wav	Similarly, a noise for one person cannot be can be a entertainment for other person all right	train
audio_0_199679.wav	It turns out that in every circuit the nonlinear element can be replaced by some linear equivalent	train
audio_0_48323.wav	let us understand that	train
audio_0_211990.wav	so, very intelligently, you loot the data based on the topic	train
audio_0_187035.wav	So, let us look at why would want to actually do this hypothesis test	train
audio_0_64316.wav	so again due to this, this, this rc effects, the nature of the signal gets distorted	train
audio_0_225010.wav	In other words, the first job has a very long gap within which it can be scheduled without any penalty, whereas this second job has to finish more or less assuming it starts initially	train
audio_0_57764.wav	so in the example we just saw, this y one was required because the load capacitance of the path one was large	train
audio_0_210677.wav	14 mm, so we have the triangle	train
audio_0_103009.wav	To summarize, we have introduced the concept of basic concept of exceptions, the types and stages and discuss the error handling in C	train
audio_0_30459.wav	So, I think now that we have got a chance to discuss this	train
audio_0_53830.wav	this immediately gives me that velocity square is b over row	train
audio_0_30969.wav	So, we will work through how do we you know setup the equations, convert it into something called a weak form, which is very characteristic to FEM, I will tell you what that is and then how do we solve it ok	train
audio_0_42940.wav	So, you can see that the power it this E cross H term over here E cross H star can be real can be imaginary right and we will have both parts the complex number	train
audio_0_151714.wav	In this case we are going to do the same in real time	train
audio_0_47072.wav	Next we create within GAF another subdirectory called symbols	train
audio_0_96221.wav	it maybe longer because it covers a wide audience	train
audio_0_10000.wav	So, this is A, this is B	train
audio_0_93406.wav	why should an apple have an isnt	train
audio_0_235346.wav	Then, we have career motives and needs	train
audio_0_79078.wav	So, what or rather you have a honeycombed structure	train
audio_0_74618.wav	So, this is your INM, and this is your ONM or outer nuclear membrane and within this you have the entire DNA, it is present as chromosomes	train
audio_0_195921.wav	That is from this point onwards this is the output of the op amp that I call VS	train
audio_0_168831.wav	Initially it is like this, the circuit is connected	train
audio_0_98136.wav	But, I have just passed the function name directly	train

audio_0_83179.wav	So, what is flicker noise, is a flicker noise	train
audio_0_99001.wav	So, whenever you need to use specifically say in the template that you are talking about a type you use this type name keyword, you cannot use a class here to mean the something, because that will get confused with the nested class because if you have a class within a scope then it means another different class definition	train
audio_0_178083.wav	The feeder losses at the transmitter side we are given as 2 dB and the noise figure of the receiver is given as 8 dB we do need to understand the baud rate	train
audio_0_2829.wav	So, this is your what you call induction machine equivalent circuit, but r c is not shown here we will show it	train
audio_0_160508.wav	So what can mean is that only one copy of that attribute value can be stored and it can be said that this is shared by tuples whose IDs are from whatever 900 or some 1 to 100 or 230 to 312 and so on so forth	train
audio_0_98031.wav	The compiler has to decide which particular one it should bind to	train
audio_0_210675.wav	1 mm	train

audio_0_157057.wav	is kind of like the joint and the idea is instead of two relations there are two sets but then the intersection union operations are being done in that for almost the same philosophy using the same philosophy	train
audio_0_217103.wav	in other words, what actually happens is the ah, ah, the sensitivity	train
audio_0_48353.wav	so let's say this is minus q plus q for the same distance	train
audio_0_180921.wav	So, if I keep increasing capacity if I keep increasing capacity the number of cells will keep increasing which means the number of base stations will keep increasing am I right and that eventually means cost	train
audio_0_34271.wav	Then we looked at some considerations on the current source bandwidth and how that the maximum bandwidth gets indirectly related to the time step and therefore, the space step from the courant parameter ok	train
audio_0_230316.wav	And this on this is resting; this is resting on a slip gauge	train
audio_0_1193.wav	See another thing is the this is actually the this is just for the sake of compliment generating mode and slip is negative	train

audio_0_98596.wav	Now no matter how many times I want to concatenate strings, I do not read to write this code over and over again, where as in case of the style shown in the left hand side, if I have now two other strings different strings, I need to do the tried this code again	train
audio_0_238964.wav	If they are not doing so well, reasons should be found out, for why they are not doing well	train
audio_0_39051.wav	So, this wire which is lying along the y axis it has some length L, it has 1 volt you make it even simpler perfect conductor	train
audio_0_208627.wav	Because curve is passing through this point this will be three units that will be 4 units, so 3 by 4 units we are going to get	train
audio_0_182497.wav	Processing gain is what you get because of your spreading factor and this is the reason why we do spread spectrum, not for AWGN because in AWGN we will not get any benefit	train
audio_0_160132.wav	So this entire thing is stored like a graph database	train
audio_0_228431.wav	So, next is valid measurement	train
audio_0_95256.wav	if you are going to tell them, if you are going to comply with their request, say to it that you write the good news first in every business letter, whether it is a letter of enquiry, whether it is a response to the enquiry, whether it is a letter ah, when somebody is going to reply to your complaint, and all announce the good news first and avoid dull openings	train
audio_0_183205.wav	Now the effective area basically depends on some elements, it first of all depends on the size of the antenna the larger the size a larger it is effective or effective power that it can in the effective power that it can intercept	train

audio_0_220978.wav	For example, we might assume, that we have a primitive operation to actually exchange the values in two variables though we know, that to implement is we actually have to go via a third temporary variable	train
audio_0_180726.wav	So, phi gamma of s for a Rayleigh pdf, for Rayleigh pdf is given by 1 over 1 minus gamma s	train
audio_0_74796.wav	So, as a consequence you can have if this was a geometry at 1 given edge, at 1 given time instant you can track	train
audio_0_82302.wav	Otherwise you will not be able to see the output voltage whatever we are trying to observe	train
audio_0_202354.wav	So, now, as this pinion moves forward you can see this rotating, if we lock this and we will move this rack we can see this rotating; so, now, if we move this pinion	train
audio_0_59445.wav	now recall what we mentioned during our last lecture	train
audio_0_102536.wav	That if you provide the correct context of try clauses and put appropriate catch handlers, then you can write the whole code without really thinking of the exception situations and fill in the catch handlers for the different exception situations in a completely separate code base, so that being a much better clarity to that	train
audio_0_121528.wav	And the public sphere here is this space, the study space, the space where the farther occupies and does his writing and where we have the visitor waiting to meet many	train
audio_0_150009.wav	I hope that is making sense essentially the conclusion there is that people come back to that same location with the examples like me doing it in IIIT Delhi, that is figure 6 that is an interesting analysis	train
audio_0_162550.wav	So, actually this equation is P r by P t I am somewhere from here P t has been gone, P t D t you see all these are actually should be P r is equal to W t A e r, there was a P t that P t here was a P t, but after that that P t has been lost	train
audio_0_101363.wav	But x, you cannot change within the function	train

audio_0_199902.wav	It cannot be in triode region because if it has to be in the triode or linear region, VDS has to be less than VGS minus VT	train
audio_0_54732.wav	or i can think of minus divergence of m as that magnetic charge that gives rise to h	train
audio_0_59528.wav	so let us note this down and this diagram also: the delay of this is one, this is two, this is two and this is two	train
audio_0_153762.wav	The Germans tend to be more strict about the range of distance, that indicates intrusion	train
audio_0_96545.wav	imagine yourself as an intranet in an organization and you have been given lots of loads, and these loads carry writing loads	train

audio_0_215744.wav	even then, the the sessions are useful	train
audio_0_38570.wav	Right now the situation has changed a little bit, I have something like this	train
audio_0_35822.wav	Right, one from delta x and one from delta y so, now you would have to I mean the same analysis that we did in the previous slide we would have to repeat it to generate the dispersion diagram over here	train
audio_0_77680.wav	With that I stop this lecture in the next class we will see how non linear stiffening can also be encoded at the level of a single protein	train
audio_0_202956.wav	And, based on my i, k kind of information how many data points I would like to have, I will be in a position to construct a surface	train
audio_0_118321.wav	this will help us in having more quote, unquote, some sort of a real time application to run more faith fully, right	train
audio_0_130109.wav	so today we will pick up a completely new topic and that is called hydrogen economy and fuel cells	train

audio_0_51055.wav	so this e which is changing with time so let's write that d, e, d, t is not equal to zero will give rise to a magnetic field	train
audio_0_60942.wav	so let us look at some examples here	train
audio_0_68684.wav	So, you have to have log register keeping track of it and you have dedicated members of the lab, we will ensure that your lab never runs out of it	train
audio_0_172889.wav	I combine 40% and 60% for both and then I compute the finally class average	train
audio_0_114852.wav	there are other general ah concern like inadequate policies and practices that is another ah concerned and insufficient security control, as we are looking talking about	train
audio_0_29755.wav	So, they only become aggressive, when there is a need of food or sex or something and they become cyclically, they all the year they are not	train
audio_0_223280.wav	So, globally the optimum we achieved in this algorithm is that the distance assigned by this greedy strategy happens to be the shortest distance from the source	train

audio_0_187141.wav	001 or even lower value	train
audio_0_153576.wav	This is a very superficial way of understanding Proxemics, but this is also the quintessential interpretation of the tongue	train
audio_0_202123.wav	So, if you are not giving any closed entities, it try to have this back end program which automatically assumes certain dimensions try to construct this	train
audio_0_222738.wav	So, now, we start from the second element onwards and look for the minimum	train
audio_0_173554.wav	All this part remains the same	train
audio_0_94543.wav	next to that, when you decide the channel, as i said, you decide a channel in which the receiver might be very much interested or the receiver might be accustomed to	train
audio_0_206621.wav	Enclose your front view	train
audio_0_169323.wav	Similarly, i3 ¬is positive and i¬4 ¬¬and i¬5¬ are negative and the sum of all the currents would be equal to 0 which is satisfying the particular equation of KCL or alternatively you can write that i¬1 ¬plus i¬3 ¬is equal to i¬¬¬2¬ plus i¬¬4 ¬plus i¬5¬	train
audio_0_217673.wav	when i say i mean current i, i have output current increases	train

audio_0_1611.wav	Then first you have to see that mesh and loop thing, right	train
audio_0_175165.wav	Now let us take a look at the, all the three domains are presented here graphically using the tool I have mentioned earlier, Concept Map	train
audio_0_65128.wav	so when we talk about clock tree synthesis, so it is performed in two steps	train
audio_0_89342.wav	So, a typical gadget would look something like this, it would have one or more useful instructions and then it would have a return	train
audio_0_226764.wav	If you go back to this, you will understand measured can be mechanical or see, now I will tell you the research which I am also trying to do, we have drilling machine	train
audio_0_30311.wav	This makes me share one more thing with you	train
audio_0_103840.wav	A method or a member function, which is available as a part of its class definition, so that is the core idea of methods in C++	train
audio_0_231615.wav	Other phrases such as one hundred meters, fifty kilograms, etc	train
audio_0_166446.wav	But in case of ladder method we first assume output, so it means that we will assume say one volt or one ampere as an output, which we have got from this circuit and then we use the basic laws of ohms and Kirchhoff’s law	train
audio_0_39576.wav	So, the first example they have is for example, fields in a waveguide	train
audio_0_83630.wav	While understanding input bias current,; input offset current, we knowsaw that there is a very small current that flows into the inverting and non inverting terminals; which is in the order of microamps to nanoamps, hence the assumption of 0 input current is realistic	train
audio_0_159705.wav	So, Atomicity as has been saying that either A's account is debited and B's account is credited or none of them has happened	train
audio_0_80313.wav	When I assume that this is a 0 degree phase, then at the output I will have no phase shift	train

audio_0_5725.wav	And answer is given i x is equal to minus 5 ampere it is given	train
audio_0_98288.wav	Now added with that the small thing that we have done is what we have learnt in module 6 and 7 that we have learnt to use the call by reference matrices at big objects	train
audio_0_166354.wav	Let us understand what does it mean	train
audio_0_197832.wav	Based on that you get four different types of circuits	train

audio_0_43921.wav	So, I mean, for example, this boundary itself is a closed boundary in closing the object ok	train
audio_0_20080.wav	So, please calculate last year's profit first and based on the profit we will be able to calculate the taxes	train
audio_0_121743.wav	So, he mocks Mourgan, he kind of teases him	train
audio_0_214816.wav	and if you are able to read the magnetic field of this magnet, change in magnetic field of this magnet, then effectively read calibrated, measured, the temperature of this bearing, right	train
audio_0_33290.wav	So, when I write I will use Taylor’s theorem, because that is what we used	train
audio_0_29441.wav	No, what I was saying is that say for example, I am told through different kind of stories	train
audio_0_8841.wav	13 volt, right	train
audio_0_53225.wav	then we have learnt about curl of electric field arising due to changing magnetic field, which is the faraday's law	train
audio_0_88872.wav	So in order to do that we also created this Python script payload generator with exit, which creates the string not only comprising of the system function that we have here and its corresponding argument but also the exit function, so this address you would require to fill with the address of the exit function, which would be present somewhere in the libc memory region of the process	train
audio_0_207098.wav	And we would like to have cut sectional view of this element, how it looks like	train
audio_0_51862.wav	and then we have v t s, d s s square plus v square t square, three by two	train
audio_0_62126.wav	so we can model this as a signal flow graph where we use two dummy notes in the input side and the output side, and every, you can say every signal line or every gate can be represented by a verdicts	train
audio_0_123391.wav	so thats means that finally, you will ah have a response which is equal to the steady state response	train
audio_0_54747.wav	this is a solution for m and therefore b, which is b applied plus b due to m, or h, which is h applied plus h due to m, is going to be equal to h	train
audio_0_75718.wav	So, in step 3 you have translocation of the cell body and finally, in step 4 you have de adhesion	train
audio_0_179245.wav	So, the final results says the probability of error of BPSK in Rayleigh fading has a very nice close form expression which is given by one half one minus square root of gamma by one plus gamma just substitutions I hope you will be able to do that without much difficult	train
audio_0_57793.wav	the other case is that when i talk about c, this a, b were already conducting	train
audio_0_195731.wav	So all of these are basically higher order terms	train
audio_0_212442.wav	in any case, there will have to be analytic so that the data that is stored is made useful	train
audio_0_207009.wav	This compasses are of different quality and also strength; the sophisticated ones have nice metallic frames so that the grip always be good, and this is the part where pencil lead can be inserted	train
audio_0_72045.wav	You can go to the market, get it, or you may order online and get it	train
audio_0_232615.wav	So that will show you as a fully developed personality, so that is why I am going to give you some simple tips, simple steps for caring for our environment and try to start caring for the environment by using these tips as quick as possible	train

audio_0_203395.wav	For that purpose what we do is, click Smart Dimension, click this line	train
audio_0_122744.wav	Both the parents are there, the mother and the father, and they don't notice Ravi until he comes out, crying	train
audio_0_206709.wav	So, first of all, one has to visualize the views carefully	train
audio_0_208782.wav	P6 on A6 goes there	train
audio_0_130665.wav	so the point is: use combustion gases after seeding, that is, in an mhd duct first and use it subsequently	train
audio_0_57954.wav	so, ah, we shall be briefly looking at several ah broad classes of algorithms	train
audio_0_47529.wav	So the source has to have sinking capability and it will go in this direction	train
audio_0_84348.wav	nNow we can also stop the signal by run and stop button is there, and here I think run and stop button is here that is	train
audio_0_77196.wav	So, what has been also observed is by correlating these time constants with the value of stiffness using AFM, what is observed is tau is generally inversely correlated with that of stiffness	train
audio_0_147907.wav	Therefore, it is not only that the contents that are posted are not credible, but you can also have these problems like compromised accounts	train
audio_0_84152.wav	Again, for band reject filter, we will see how we can design this band reject filter using operational amplifier	train
audio_0_215636.wav	so if you add an initial polarization, its hard to say what was the ultimate polarization when it reached the r, f, i, d, tag	train
audio_0_48842.wav	This is the box and I am interested in what fluid is going out	train
audio_0_46455.wav	So V In minus of minus V 0, again V in plus V 0 the device minus v0 again v in plus v0 the device has to handle so you see that here the device ratings will be much higher than in the buck converter or in the boost converter see the buck converter as the least voltage rating the boost converter the higher rating and the case the buck boost converter you have the in plus v0 as the rating for the devices and coming to the current the current wave shape for the inductor will be similar except that the notation will change this average value will be i in plus i0 you see that the average value the current which is flowing during the time and this is on this is i in during the time this is off the current will be flowing here i not so average of i in and average of i not both are combining and flowing through l so the average value here will be iIn plus i0 and that is what we have indicated here	train
audio_0_204598.wav	Now, the projection if we are drawing this entire pentagon in this view front view if we are looking from that this line coincides with that one edge as a surface	train
audio_0_148285.wav	We expect you to actually post at least one question or answer or have a question, make comment, etcetera once per week	train
audio_0_143619.wav	We will assume that since the 50 items are already there in the opening inventory, the 30 items which are issued must have been issued from the opening inventory	train
audio_0_150039.wav	Because here to get the country that I am from India more difficult to get that I'm from Tamilnadu as a state it is even more difficult to get that I am from Chennai, that is about the inference of the home location	train
audio_0_139547.wav	And then here this also after A/D converters, and they have their own processors so the value is firstly coming to that embedded communication controller processor, and then using some very standard communication protocol either you know, RS 232, 422, 485 or IEEE 488 there are number of protocols by which through computer communication it is coming to what is known as the host computer	train
audio_0_155318.wav	In the opinion of Simon Bronner, these tactual metaphors suggest is certain level of truth and a clarity of perception	train
audio_0_153547.wav	Work time and personal times are strictly separated in monochronic cultures; however, in polychronic cultures we find that the work time and personal time are not strictly separated they often include in to each other	train
audio_0_2893.wav	Now this amounts or to certain approximation which is quite acceptable in the normal range of slip in an induction machine these an approximation	train
audio_0_40129.wav	So, A so B 1 is anyway 0	train
audio_0_216797.wav	you read this sensor value in this direction, write it into either flash or ram and then follow this arrow and then, either over s p, i or i two c, you write it back into this location and get it back to the phone	train
audio_0_29299.wav	So if we replace the internal implementation from a sorted list to a heap we get better behavior, but in terms of the actual values that the user sees as a sequence of inserts and delete max the user does not see any difference between the sorted list implementation and the heap implementation	train
audio_0_174545.wav	Just roughly the classroom sessions need to be identified	train
audio_0_47447.wav	So by the Faraday's law if you look at that you will see that the L is equal to L, D	train
audio_0_219047.wav	So, for example, if I take this node, then it covers these three, these four edges, because all these edges start at 2	train
audio_0_224206.wav	Now, we go through the list one more time the list of vertices and every time will see an indegree 0 we add i to the queue	train
audio_0_185986.wav	So, when I just touched that line that is the best compromise because that is where I become feasible for the rst time and going any further would only make my objective function worse	train
audio_0_191914.wav	So, this is something that you have to carefully think about and understand	train
audio_0_3600.wav	So, your leq is equal to 4 henry and R is equal to 8 ohm	train
audio_0_39884.wav	It will be not be non zero anywhere because as long as there is a field this response is always going to be there	train
audio_0_221785.wav	And now once again I will stop, because I have reached the left most position, there is nothing to the left	train
audio_0_226902.wav	Direct writing type Oscillographs are there	train
audio_0_119160.wav	a service, a provider, once a new service is launched on, when, say, service is updated, it is basically it publish the service in the registry so that perspective buyer or perspective consumer, consumer requestor can find that where that this type of services are there	train
audio_0_190341.wav	So, 1 sigma 1 is 1, so sigma n is n, so I am going to first consider the case F equal to Q, sigma n is equal to n for all n in Z	train
audio_0_233595.wav	Once their goals are clear, then the objectives of the training program, aligned with a person's personal and organizational goals, can be made clear, right in the beginning of the program	train
audio_0_47450.wav	Let us look at this part of the equation n d5 by d t what is the flux within the core	train
audio_0_199050.wav	In case of P MOS, the drain voltage can go above the gate voltage but not by more than one threshold voltage	train
audio_0_189670.wav	You have to pass how many number of rows, you want to have how many number of columns, you want to have in your matrix and this is the important one by row usually R arranges the elements you have entered in a column fashion, if you want the elements that are given to be entered in a row as fashion you have to say by row as true the default option for by row is false	train
audio_0_176164.wav	In every subject or every branch you have to go from one point to the other	train
audio_0_89033.wav	So based on the number of challenges we categorize these PUFs as a weak PUF because it has a very small set of challenges, in fact the challenges linearly dependent on the number of ring oscillators or the strong PUF in case of arbiter because the number of challenges that are possible are exponentially related to the number of arbiter switches that are present	train
audio_0_218917.wav	So, let us look at some issues involving intractability	train
audio_0_103208.wav	All that you do is write the word virtual between in front of the destructor of p; up to this point there is nothing different, there is nothing different in the expected behavior and the output	train
audio_0_187829.wav	This is a qualitative way of looking at it, we can quantify this and there are several measures that have been proposed depending on the type of variable and the kind of association you are looking for	train
audio_0_222586.wav	So, recall that a graph is a set of vertices or nodes V connected by a set of edges E	train
audio_0_46.wav	So, obviously, T is the target, y is the value of the quality characteristics which their y minus T is the really the deviation from the target you know basically mapping the losses of the square of deviation from the target	train
audio_0_121469.wav	And that's the meaning of the word Raab, a noisy argument or fight	train
audio_0_121445.wav	So, this incident is something that kind of tells us that the cabulaywala is offering raisins and nuts without getting any benefit, financial benefit from that transaction	train
audio_0_71338.wav	Some parts will be prerequisite of the other parts	train
audio_0_170434.wav	Now, if you are asked to find out the value of cos of omega t minus a, what you need to do	train
audio_0_137198.wav	So phase lag can increase in many ways for example if the delay between the sensor input and the plant output exists	train
audio_0_40624.wav	So, there is a x derivative, there is a t derivative, there is no y derivative correct	train
audio_0_187980.wav	So, let us look at the first level of model assessment	train
audio_0_18786.wav	So, not saying again and again; it is understandable to you , right	train
audio_0_41164.wav	So, I said if I can find out this Green function I can solve this problem right and that was the impulse response idea	train
audio_0_45762.wav	You can use anything that is suitable to you and you can also probably use the spice provided transformer and even the linear transformer to at least get the concepts	train
audio_0_1228.wav	And from equation 26, then I 2 dash will be V Thevenin upon root over this expression this we know right already we know	train
audio_0_228101.wav	So, again here by applying Ohm’s law Ohm’s law, you get this circuit, i current is nothing, but the voltage applied by R b plus k R t if ballast resistor is 0, then i is nothing, but e i by k R t where k is the factor k is the factor	train
audio_0_117515.wav	now, interestingly, the objective may vary from the consumer to consumer, like even a ah consumer	train
audio_0_162823.wav	Similarly, half power beam width in degree it will be 68	train
audio_0_103236.wav	In polygon, we have triangle, quadrilateral; there could be many more in closed conics, we have ellipse, circle and so on	train
audio_0_220791.wav	Because, in selection sort wherever we do this long distance thing, so remember in selection sort we pick the minimum and then we exchange it with the beginning	train
audio_0_121950.wav	So, when they have become friends, the girl asks, Kabaliwala, oh Kabaliwala, what is in your sack	train
audio_0_172934.wav	You take, you have already done in the earlier units you have designed course outcomes, tagged them all and now you set CO attainment targets, compute CO attainment and plan for improvement of learning for the course	train
audio_0_99539.wav	So, what we do, we actually have provided two different constructors, one that takes two parameters and the other that takes one parameter	train
audio_0_182250.wav	So, this is like this time resolution the time resolution getting better time resolution improvement; that means, you are going to see more multi path components, distinct multi path components	train
audio_0_108065.wav	The fact that people look at the Apple logo and attribute quality reputation, goodwill and many other things to the product was created by the trader or by the business entity itself	train
audio_0_57743.wav	if we implement this function like this, then the output will be available only after six minutes of time because one of the input a is coming only at four	train
audio_0_235179.wav	You could cut, internships or co ops	train
audio_0_152276.wav	So, that is if you remember again one of the themes that I had been mentioning across the course is actually finding out these profiles	train
audio_0_190236.wav	Remember, degree is the largest degree that appears in the polynomial must be strictly less than degree of f	train
audio_0_198119.wav	So, somehow only for signals it should appear across this	train
audio_0_194476.wav	So, by definition nZ is a prime ideal	train
audio_0_175722.wav	Reflection can also be considered as awareness	train
audio_0_121782.wav	Appa gave the appropriate order	train
audio_0_94893.wav	you also need to understand how humour has an important role to play in an oral presentation	train
audio_0_32642.wav	Now let us do the same calculation in a slightly different way	train
audio_0_134809.wav	Pushing information towards longer storage memory means that the information will now be available to you even after the lapse of 30 seconds duration	train
audio_0_103281.wav	But again in the derive class, you do not have an option of invoking that function, because that function by itself does not have a body	train
audio_0_170164.wav	And this is the A which you have got, this is B which you have got basically in this case when we write we can write 1 by M also or you can take M out also	train
audio_0_81891.wav	0 is already, there is no need to change it, no worries,	train
audio_0_47921.wav	so we have two sources: one which gives me divergent of this electric field equals row r over epsilon zero, and another one which gives me curl of electric field as equal to minus d v by d t	train
audio_0_211342.wav	ok, if you, if you are able to keep the ah temperature differential for long time for for in a sustain manner, why not	train
audio_0_36247.wav	Do they correspond to any physical angle	train
audio_0_223641.wav	But, it something on the right is bigger than something on the left, then that is an inversion, we have to count all such pairs	train
audio_0_92222.wav	So, we can draw this easy, y equals 0 and this is the line	train
audio_0_211347.wav	so the question really is like this: right, ah, it will the basically depend on the average power for the given application	train
audio_0_219795.wav	Now, our coloring problem is to assign colors to the states, so that no two states which share an edge which are on opposite size of an edge have the same color	train
audio_0_30094.wav	People would laugh at him or her and thereby they would extend that to us also	train
audio_0_170172.wav	We continue our discussion and we will try to understand some other mechanical properties of this system	train

audio_0_130218.wav	so, hindenburg incident: that was a little detour, but, ah, i wanted to show you as to what happened actually	train
audio_0_222666.wav	So, we could have about n square edges no more and if you have about n square edges, then many of these entries in this matrix would be 1, but in most situations the number of edges is much less than n square	train
audio_0_55866.wav	this is my setup time, and after the edge comes i have to again wait for a minimum time	train
audio_0_31471.wav	If epsilon becomes a function of space then we call it a heterogeneous medium ok, but I can have a homogeneous medium that is anisotropic	train

audio_0_97725.wav	But, the other side of the fact is independently both the applications as developed by Savitha for the male students and by Niloy for the female students independently they work, it’s only that the, they are sharing certain common names and therefore namespace turns out to be a panacea which can solve this problem very easily	train
audio_0_224225.wav	So, let us first look at this combining step	train
audio_0_35764.wav	Do you recognize a term like this up here somewhere in the expression above	train
audio_0_212399.wav	so, without getting into the detail, very good, so why should you have an edge device and why should you have a gateway device	train
audio_0_121371.wav	Their entire life is obsessed by this game of chess and their entire life is cut off because of this game of chess	train
audio_0_119724.wav	so its a scenario in which objects or people are provided with unique identifiers, that means has been identified, and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring to human, human or human to computer interactions	train
audio_0_225041.wav	So, there is a job i which appears before jobs j and O, but the deadline of j is strictly before the deadline of i	train
audio_0_220914.wav	So, what we can do is, we can first build a heap, right	train
audio_0_207170.wav	So, such kind of representation what we call removed sections; it is not that we have a slice of circle there	train
audio_0_200369.wav	So that is what is implied by these two small signal parameters	train
audio_0_48787.wav	gradient we wrote as partial derivatives in the direction x with respect to x plus y, partial y plus z, partial z	train
audio_0_120078.wav	our popular iaas, paas and thing paas are the infrastructure	train
audio_0_38278.wav	It is leaving this red box, this D x on the left hand side which is coming in I will call it D x minus, this D y over here plus because it is going out and D y minus because it is coming in	train
audio_0_103564.wav	But still it will inherit the function f, it will inherit the function g and clarify one more notation here is this notation which we have mentioned earlier that a class is a namespace	train
audio_0_145146.wav	Of course, when a task gets generated, inserting in the queue is O1 because it gets inserted at the end of the queue	train
audio_0_63696.wav	so fpga provides them with a big advantage in terms of the configurability and ease of use	train
audio_0_235558.wav	And, you should know, how to get there	train
audio_0_118395.wav	what we say pay a metered service, right, pay as you go	train
audio_0_193155.wav	This is the only possible factorization of a monomial of the form a constant times X power n because if there is any other factorization that means, if for example, phi p g has two terms then in the product also you will have two terms	train
audio_0_189524.wav	There is also something called balanced accuracy which is equal to 0	train
audio_0_222966.wav	So, now we just add one more field called height, so now whenever we do any rebalancing, then the height of this tree may change the current node	train
audio_0_180038.wav	So, that was one aspect of it the second one was that you could do cells splitting to increase your capacity this is for increasing capacity ok	train
audio_0_132390.wav	so to do that for maximum work output, what i will do is i will go to this value of wl which i recall is m into one plus m whole square times alpha squared th minus tc whole squared, ok	train
audio_0_212513.wav	it says: i want point you to something i saw on the web and i though you should just, you know, quickly show you some numbers	train
audio_0_132056.wav	the gas, hot gas which is coming that might have ah, some amount of fuel, let in it	train
audio_0_26266.wav	So, we have a generator, which tells us where to get the values from	train
audio_0_101797.wav	We all know that C has a possible use of a Boolean type, which is a type where we say that it can take a value, either true or false	train
audio_0_218930.wav	From the studentÕs point of view obviously, the problems is to generate the solution	train
audio_0_28315.wav	So, we start from here	train
audio_0_59384.wav	so this y plus x manhatten distance is this x plus y	train
audio_0_179538.wav	What are all the things that are constants	train
audio_0_101705.wav	Now, another major point to note in this sample ‘hello world’ program is when we do printf, we can have arbitrary number of parameters, we call this variadic function	train
audio_0_175795.wav	Then what happens having done that, having monitored during the process you should be able to check the outcomes	train
audio_0_93984.wav	hence careful speakers, careful communicators: they know and decide the proper timing of the message as well as the way your presentation or talk should be timed	train
audio_0_111018.wav	So, that is the idea and that is why we made that step 1 the instruction was locate the point where r bar is equal to 1	train
audio_0_123085.wav	Is the story bright and cheerful or dark and frightening or any way in between on this spectrum	train
audio_0_18542.wav	So, and you know that V is equal to what you call V angle 0 right and I is equal to you know this is rms	train
audio_0_49717.wav	in this third demonstration i am going to show you that the electric field that is produced by changing magnetic field is non conservative	train
audio_0_189368.wav	It is also a parametric approach since at the end of the application of the algorithm we are going to get parameters out of it	train
audio_0_144119.wav	We ignore market value unless there is some specific condition for taking it into account	train
audio_0_178846.wav	We said that under this assumption, we can then look at 2 possibilities, one computing or how do you achieve ergodic capacity	train
audio_0_163589.wav	So, gain in the backward direction also how much reduce you can get; input impedance, bandwidth, front to back ratio, minor lobe level etc	train
audio_0_156109.wav	Now that means that if that writing is being done while it is reading then the summary is etc may be wrong	train
audio_0_182225.wav	So, you cannot you know just spread arbitrarily and the other scenario is that we do not have first of all Q, Qs has to be smaller	train
audio_0_132148.wav	together those industries are using waste heat recovery in different form	train
audio_0_56367.wav	ok, so these are some criteria you can use, you can follow to optimise on the clock frequency	train
audio_0_188428.wav	Now whenever the left hand side becomes linearly dependent, if the same linear dependence is maintained on the right hand side also then we have the situation of consistent equations	train
audio_0_194454.wav	p divides ab, but in the ring theoretic language that we are learning in this course, this means that ab is in the ideal pZ	train
audio_0_190513.wav	So, example: 1 by 2 is in R right because 1 by 2 is of the form 0 plus 1 by 2, but 1 by 2 squared which is 1 by 4 is not in R right	train
audio_0_224786.wav	And so in this, because 16:12 happens to be the earliest event among these 6, it will automatically float up to the route and so it will be available to us is the next event to the process and then maybe 2 minutes before that event may happens, we get send signal to the flight giving a clearance to take off	train
audio_0_5865.wav	So, an independent voltage source is a basically a two terminal element for example, your this is a voltage source say two terminal element right and symbol I will come to that later right	train
audio_0_178528.wav	What is going to be the challenge for us is to building the coherent detector for this	train
audio_0_225961.wav	A couple of decades later after this industrial revolution or during the time of industrial, the sellers system of screw threads came into use in United States	train
audio_0_166858.wav	So we can write power P in terms of Vth, RL and Rth like shown in the slide	train
audio_0_172569.wav	You have to, the student should be able to do something under some conditions	train
audio_0_233655.wav	Too much of a difference from the routine, may result in, some breakages of process or some interruptions in the process	train
audio_0_6161.wav	Now suppose it is M I j, right so, it is I th row say i is equal to 2 and j is equal to 3; that means, second row and third column, right	train
audio_0_189235.wav	We are also going to look at the model summary and identify the insignificant variables and discard them and rebuild the model	train
audio_0_8169.wav	Now question is, this one your this 100 volt source is there, but one step input is also there here that is 15 u t volt, right	train
audio_0_115045.wav	so what are what they looking for	train
audio_0_76359.wav	So, how would you test this	train
audio_0_185822.wav	The problem with this is that, if for example, there are a whole lot of attributes which actually are not at all important from a classification viewpoint, then what happens is, though they are not important from a classification viewpoint, they contribute in the distance measure	train
audio_0_176338.wav	What is important, what is not important and so that you can focus on the, you can see many newspaper items will have lot of unimportant or repetitive materials rather than by the time you come to the what you consider important part of the presented material	train
audio_0_133734.wav	So, when we look at learning we are basically trying to look at stimulus responses association and when we say that we are looking at stimulus response association organism of course has his or her own importance when at the same time response means overt as well as the covert response	train
audio_0_219114.wav	And of course, Fibonacci of 1 towards it is base case have been call several times: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times and Fibonacci of 0 has been called 3 times	train
audio_0_131516.wav	so therefore, if i look at it, this is the energy that is being delivered from here	train
audio_0_55818.wav	so the ideal clock should have come here, but because of some additional delays, the clock is reaching after some delay	train
audio_0_220634.wav	If the airline grows to twenty flights, we will still have be able to give our answer in a reasonable time	train
audio_0_239171.wav	How will you measure this better performance	train
audio_0_212687.wav	essentially, ah, the way it goes	train
audio_0_83326.wav	Again you see I am breaking this module into small modules or breaking the lecture into small modules, so that you can understand the concept, read it, solve the problems get more problems and solve by yourself all right	train
audio_0_93597.wav	today you will have to develop all these qualities of being with a group	train
audio_0_116852.wav	so there are different aspects of the things	train
audio_0_180330.wav	In fact, the Nakagami m actually has a slightly broader range and we can show that there is a relationship that maps the Nakagami m and the Rician fading very closely	train
audio_0_157780.wav	So the undoing must be done in the order of the reverse of the log	train
audio_0_231166.wav	Suppose for the weight, if I use a sense oil pressure sensor, it has a weight compressor, the oil gets leaked and the pressure increases	train
audio_0_223575.wav	So, fundamental step in such a recommendations system is that of comparing profiles, how does one persons likes, how do one persons likes and dislikes compare to those of others	train
audio_0_133847.wav	So, why someone is doing what he or she was doing why people think the way they think, why certain type of acceptance rejection certain types of gossip certain type of rumors certain type of preconceive notions why some people are you know touristic and some or not all those in our dynamics of human behavior you would be very easily able to decipher and this in turn will make you extremely effective at your work place	train
audio_0_33116.wav	Of course, that is not possible	train
audio_0_130799.wav	so lets say, from the saturated condition we are expanding the fluid	train
audio_0_89388.wav	Now we assume that this c3 corresponds to a return instruction and once we have found this c3 instruction we try to build gadgets out of it	train
audio_0_93485.wav	and if we say you are requested to submit the report by the weekend, now this is passive	train
audio_0_133097.wav	And he gave is famous ice berg theory, no where he said that approximately 9/ 10th of our mental faculty remains unconscious to us	train
audio_0_106818.wav	Now, you also have a provision, where you need to mention the inventor, regardless of who owns the invention	train
audio_0_97852.wav	Global scopes do not have a name, but can be identified by this scope resolution operator	train
audio_0_169275.wav	In that case the value of i2 would be 12 by 76 ampere in case i0	train
audio_0_81801.wav	Because your trans the supply voltage that you are applying to this particular equipment is your 230 volts AC, 230 volts AC which I have applied right by connecting it to 230 volts	train
audio_0_199317.wav	And here we see that V1 is VS divided by this resistive divider	train
audio_0_104129.wav	Second, in this case we have a bigger problem because it is not only about forgetting to call de init, but there is a bigger issue is even if I remember, what is up exact location where I should call de init, if I call de init and after calling d init I try to use the stack	train
audio_0_63565.wav	so signal integrity and crosstalk analysis are something that we shall also be talking about	train
audio_0_19857.wav	So, if you remember we had done some cases on special pricing or say government contracts or those contracts where normal market is not affected	train
audio_0_162678.wav	Now, on the z axis on the z axis theta is 0 so, k not sin theta fully 0	train
audio_0_61339.wav	so basically you translate your design or circuit net list in to an equivalent circuit which consists of voltage source, current sources, controlled voltage sources, controlled current sources, r, l, c values, etcetera, and subsequently you carry out a traditional circuit analysis, which typically requires lot of computation	train
audio_0_202165.wav	First construct an offset not in this direction, but in the reverse direction	train
audio_0_169129.wav	So in that case you cannot apply the homogeneity and additivity property for getting the power across the resistor because these are not linearly related	train
audio_0_64558.wav	so the total number of possiblities will be three into three	train
audio_0_143737.wav	In technical analysis, the price data of the company, the volume, the movements of prices, the charts, all these things are studied	train
audio_0_119817.wav	and ah before approach the pipe, ah parking lot, enabling ah these iot, through gateway to the cloud, can find out that where, where the vacancies are there right	train
audio_0_43489.wav	So, what will happen now even if the wave comes at a non normal direction what will happen	train
audio_0_186000.wav	So, we wrote the following equations for the optimum point for identifying the optimum point we said minus grad of f has to be lambda grad of h and then we have h of x equal to 0	train
audio_0_121183.wav	On the one hand we have the Begum of Mirza who is very self centered because all she wants is the attention of the husband	train
audio_0_144301.wav	We have just given two examples of valuation of stock and depreciation, but some more examples you can find if you read carefully	train
audio_0_25727.wav	Now let us show this, the bonds to the eliminated or the eliminated groups H and X must be in the same plane that is number one	train
audio_0_210251.wav	Usually this wireframe models contain information on planes such as the size and orientation; something like whether the surface is oriented by 40 degrees, 50 degrees and so on	train
audio_0_45116.wav	We'll call the input source as V In	train
audio_0_92490.wav	So, we can talk about sin x cos x so that value will be also 0, and here the reasoning is very clear the cos is the even function here, sin is the odd function and when we integrate minus pi to pi this integrand is odd, so the value is 0 irrespective of whatever n or m is	train
audio_0_115207.wav	so the api is whether need to be redone on new type of api has to be there and there are various protocols	train
audio_0_88049.wav	So note that this power consumption is obtained from an oscilloscope and it is the real power consumption when the actual secret key is being computed upon, so this power consumption is obtained by measuring instruments such as a digital oscilloscope, while on the other hand the power obtained from the model of the device is obtained just by some calculations or just by some mathematical analysis	train
audio_0_64154.wav	placement means given a block where in the chip i have to place the block	train
audio_0_238740.wav	And, we help them, become familiar with the environment, they find themselves in	train
audio_0_116438.wav	right, scalability is one of the major aspects of cloud	train
audio_0_94763.wav	as i have been saying, you should use language in a very active manner, whether you are describing your experience, your activities, if, if you are talking about something that you did in the past, please make use of past tense	train
audio_0_81099.wav	Then we should understand how each thing helps us to understand for the design of the circuit	train
audio_0_196728.wav	Now, like we discussed with the original common source amplifier with a fixed gate source wires, this condition ensures that the gain of the amplifier is the same whether the capacitor is there or not	train
audio_0_20305.wav	5 versus sale of 2	train
audio_0_14084.wav	793, but it just match right	train
audio_0_116938.wav	so how these two data series, behavioral things are there	train
audio_0_115642.wav	so this is important that you scan and see that what is the security quote, unquote, security health of your ah installation so other scanner will allow to exploit	train
audio_0_95427.wav	and when you work in a team, of course conflicts will arise, but then, if you continue to go with the conflict that may be difficult for all of us to survive	train
audio_0_151791.wav	In September for example, someone posted a supposed murder confession on Post Secret, prompting a frenzied reddit search for the self professed criminal	train
audio_0_178658.wav	Which is exactly our situation, please substitute this result and verify that psi of gamma MRC of s that is the moment generating function comes out to be 1 minus 1 minus Gamma s raise to the power M	train
audio_0_96175.wav	at times you find it is very difficult when a critical situation comes	train
audio_0_73166.wav	26 so the total number of adjusted function points or the adjusted function point counts for this project will be equal given as 606	train
audio_0_184947.wav	5 times gamma 2 plus 0	train
audio_0_62890.wav	similarly, when there are two polysilicon and diffusion layers, these are not related and the two layers, they must be a one lambda separation between them	train
audio_0_64567.wav	but there is an interesting result which can make us feel good	train
audio_0_166028.wav	Now this is; mesh analysis is also called loop analysis or you can say mesh current method	train
audio_0_61734.wav	so how it looks like	train
audio_0_228952.wav	So, here as like you can say that C chart monitors the number defects in one unit, but U chart monitors or track the number defects per unit, u chart monitors number of defects per unit, ok	train
audio_0_219231.wav	It is a bit analogous to bfs or dfs, because it keeps visit in vertices and it visits every vertex only once	train
audio_0_239070.wav	Now, you know, with the advent of computers, with the advent of the internet, with the advent of cell phones, a lot of things are happening online	train
audio_0_224292.wav	Similarly we merge the second pair, it does not change in order, because 22 is smaller than 78	train
audio_0_169466.wav	Now, if an ideal transformer is rated as 2400 by 120 volt and the KV rating is 9	train
audio_0_169850.wav	Now the second case, is that in case of v 2 we will set 5 volt dc source and the 2 sin 5 t current source 0	train
audio_0_93989.wav	you will find that if you want to meet an important person in an organization, you either have to seek time or well in advance, and then the other person, namely the director of the chairman	train
audio_0_41680.wav	Well in this case infinity by infinity from I can do it in either way right	train
audio_0_8977.wav	So, basically if you apply the KCL then i 1 plus i 2 plus i 4 is equal to 0, this is at node 1 and all i 1, i 2, i 3, easily, you can know in terms of v 1, v 2, v 3, you can substitute, similarly, at node 2, if you apply node 2, if you apply KCL	train
audio_0_145552.wav	To check that we need to use the Liu Leland criterion and the Leland criterion we first need to compute the utilization due to the two tasks	train
audio_0_237669.wav	If not, then, why should they be paid, these heavy salaries	train
audio_0_85143.wav	That means if I do not apply anything here if I apply 0 voltage here, you see in the left side right then the current will be 0 it will not flow right if I increase VDS my current will start increasing right	train
audio_0_8801.wav	So, you will find magnetic circuit also will be analogous to almost electrical circuit, right	train
audio_0_153029.wav	Business culture: Here a case in high context cultures, this is lesser in low context cultures	train
audio_0_216775.wav	as long as it is closely paired with this coil ah, you should be able to do several things by writing data, reading data and so on into the n f c memory, ok, and you can also access through s p i and i two c, you can also access the	train
audio_0_188918.wav	Statistics is also intricately embedded into the data science techniques in terms of the formulation themselves and also in characterizing the properties of the machine learning techniques	train
audio_0_149404.wav	Let’s just add a debug print statement, when the loop begins, found next page	train
audio_0_205783.wav	So, most of the slides, information is inspired by his works and taken with his permission	train
audio_0_232406.wav	But, having said that, this, the process that is involved in accumulating this, the assignments that you do, the discussions that you have in the forum, the kind of mindset that is undergoing a transformation from a very rigid mindset to an open and a growth mindset	train
audio_0_153195.wav	So, you would find that it is a display of the power dynamics, it is also a display of the relationship	train
audio_0_21665.wav	Now same way try to do it for Feb	train
audio_0_60469.wav	all three bits are changing	train
audio_0_85522.wav	So during the first access at the location P0 XOR K0 that would result in a cache miss and one block of memory would get loaded into the cache, the second access at the index P4 XOR K4 could either result in a cache hit or a cache miss, a cache hit is incurred when the index P4 XOR K4 exactly collides or is very close to this value of P0 XOR K0, in such a case it would indicate that this second access is to the same or to a neighbouring location as the first access	train
audio_0_119286.wav	so, ah, so you have that mapper function or same mapper, dot pi	train
audio_0_70301.wav	But as the development work starts, the development team carries out their own processes, those we call as product oriented processes	train
audio_0_176097.wav	That is also prescriptive; that is prescriptive data	train
audio_0_203433.wav	You pick some object; you will be in a position to draw	train
audio_0_240090.wav	If opportunity for growth is not given, along with that training, then the employee will feel, disheartened, demotivated	train
audio_0_222031.wav	So, if this point would be saying is that the lower part has two values 32 and 22 and the upper part is empty and everything from 78 onwards is not sorted	train
audio_0_203140.wav	For example, for this Skylab experiment the space station whatever has been constructed it contains nearly 10 Lakh components	train
audio_0_21502.wav	But it comes later on	train
audio_0_12275.wav	So, in this case, so this is an Autotransformer, but we have to compare these 2 right	train
audio_0_66887.wav	So, second this what you want to achieve why test bed for studying myelinating disorders sclerosis where myelination is destroyed	train
audio_0_153098.wav	Olfactory codes are basically related with the interpretation as well as the messages which we want to convey with the help of our odor, the smell which we wear on our body etcetera	train
audio_0_167145.wav	Now, here in this case we say that in the previous figure we can observe that the summing junction will have negative feedback signal	train
audio_0_84721.wav	We will find that after UV exposure this one with bright field mask and negative photoresist, what we will find	train
audio_0_223986.wav	So, when we do DFS on a disconnected graph, each connected component will generated tree	train
audio_0_17256.wav	491 volt right	train
audio_0_120085.wav	so all this four hills us in realizing this xaas type of services	train
audio_0_190972.wav	What do we know, so far we know Z is in noetherian, any field is noetherian, polynomial ring over a field is noetherian, but the most important way for us to construct new noetherian rings is what is called Hilbert basis theorem which I will prove in the next video	train
audio_0_75619.wav	So, you have two length scales here one is Dwall, which is initial position of the moving wall from the fixed wall	train
audio_0_235600.wav	So, be aware of the opportunities, available to you	train
audio_0_75886.wav	If I were to draw a stiffness scale forward to or stiffness scale you have brain muscle and bone which have distinct mechanical properties	train
audio_0_100889.wav	Let us consider, let us go back to our string class and we will try to copy	train
audio_0_38675.wav	So, do not do it like that right	train
audio_0_56723.wav	next four bit indicate these faults	train
audio_0_108652.wav	So, the maintenance function also involves apart from record keeping the licensing of the IP that is already granted	train
audio_0_161605.wav	Because you see what happens is when a transaction fails, what happens	train
audio_0_27530.wav	We will print out a list by just constructing a python list out of it and then using str on the python list	train
audio_0_239970.wav	Again, there is a lot of debate going on, about this	train
audio_0_171265.wav	So the source voltage that is Vab and Vbc and Vca will be applying across the load impedances also	train
audio_0_67386.wav	so in this fragment i will take three situations: how this is being achieved	train
audio_0_239275.wav	Give feedback to the employee, regarding appraisal, and directions for the future	train
audio_0_185101.wav	Why did not it work	train
audio_0_142411.wav	Up to year 1000 also it was 28	train
audio_0_235414.wav	Then, the organization should be alerted, to their need, for self advancement, which is clearly not happening, through the current policies and procedures, laid down by the organization itself	train
audio_0_50033.wav	this will be the value of b for this system	train
audio_0_228499.wav	All the potential significant errors, the word significant is being used again and again here	train
audio_0_86007.wav	We leave it to the viewers to actually try this particular attack and also read the state of the art attacks in this direction and see how we could reduce the entropy or the uncertainty about the secret key to construct lesser than what we obtain over here	train
audio_0_30896.wav	So, you can assume them to be piecewise constant in each segment so, then these guys also just become numbers	train
audio_0_50090.wav	this means the charge is q at any time t take it as t, which means my charge from this plate, lower plate	train

audio_0_195055.wav	You can see that the voltage that appears here is simply 3 volts plus VS	train
audio_0_215232.wav	or its also possible that this ball bearing is part of a operator in a workshop, in a factory setup where there are lathes, for instance, or a milling machine on lathe system, which is essentially, which also has a lot of these ball bearings for rotating ah	train
audio_0_94742.wav	so you are going to gain the readers attention in the very first paragraph	train
audio_0_98074.wav	So, now, I focus only on this candidate function	train

audio_0_19312.wav	Even today, even for mobile phones, normally there could be a fixed charge and extra amount if it increases as for calls, it becomes a variable cost	train
audio_0_217930.wav	of course there is a network	train
audio_0_58307.wav	but that the thing is that here you may not be able to set all these slacks to exactly zero because that might four some t, v and t value to become negative in that case in early mode analysis	train
audio_0_135255.wav	Right now we will also refer to one fact that many a times you forget involuntarily and many a times, you forget because you want to forget that thing	train

audio_0_210377.wav	Once it is done, divide A to C into equal number of parts, same number of parts like 1, 2, 3 all the way to 9; so 10 equal parts we are going to construct on this side	train
audio_0_137690.wav	That is the calibration curve, so there is no time here, if you give an input we will get an output in the steady state, and we are only talking about this, this, the characteristic between this input and the steady state output value, right	train
audio_0_164033.wav	So, this is what we discussed in our yesterday in our lecture	train
audio_0_209096.wav	So, if I use Power Trim it removes that object, but here Spline is a continuous curve though it is showing like points from where to where we are going to construct, but when you use this Power Trim it removes the entire object, whatever the entire object you have between the points that will be removed	train

audio_0_118707.wav	so if we ah look at again parallel computing, as we have seen in our previous lectures ah, so different models of parallel computing, ah, it depends on the nature and evolution of the processor, multi processor computer architecture	train
audio_0_189506.wav	So, now let us look at the confusion matrix	train
audio_0_30200.wav	This thing of a controlled exposure to blood	train
audio_0_143583.wav	That was concept of conservatism because of conservatism if inventory is say having cost of 26,000 as we discuss but its market value has gone down to say 22,000 we will not take 26,000 in the balance sheet we will record it at at only 22,000	train
audio_0_84398.wav	cCan you use FFT	train
audio_0_92594.wav	So, we have un minus 0 where un is just x power n over n, so, x power n over n is less than 1 over n	train
audio_0_156828.wav	This needs to be applied	train
audio_0_26306.wav	Now, you see a lot of things which have come	train
audio_0_4126.wav	So, from equation 75, we know this no because it was t is equal to not zero t t is equal t t is equal to t 0 that is 4 second	train
audio_0_94018.wav	the one he said the glass is half full is optimist	train
audio_0_62164.wav	ok, you have to take all of them into account so as to come up with the realistic value of clock frequency which is expected to run this circuit in a correct way	train
audio_0_59468.wav	so when the next clock comes, this n	train
audio_0_225741.wav	The tentative schedule is as follows: in the first week, we will do some motivating examples and we will look at some notations and work out some problems involving asymptotic complexity	train
audio_0_92534.wav	And then, we say that this sequence here converges in the mean square sense, in the mean square sense, to this function f on this given interval [a, b], if the following condition holds	train
audio_0_149292.wav	And a short lived token	train
audio_0_237561.wav	Employees like to know, how they can grow	train
audio_0_19560.wav	You know the new selling price which is 32	train
audio_0_239143.wav	If the other employees are expected, only to put in, say, on an average, about 40 hours a week	train
audio_0_37077.wav	First I want to get the space parts done correctly second equation again simple	train
audio_0_209522.wav	It has limited versions, so one has to be careful with that in terms of paying money and other things	train
audio_0_36549.wav	On the other hand if I have if use the previous form then I have to do the integration of x multiplied by sin x and do all that integration both will give me the same answer because is the same function ok	train
audio_0_100448.wav	You see that it is not only b is same, this address of b is also same; because what has actually been returned, what has been returned is not the value of x	train
audio_0_133407.wav	Now look at this very face, you see the expression understand that we would be looking at full lot of faces and our attempt is to understand the facial expression with respect to musculature analysis	train
audio_0_39005.wav	So, that is why I need some a priori information	train
audio_0_158418.wav	Now if one removes the blind rights, one can show that actually it can be shown that this conflict serializability is equivalent to view serializability	train
audio_0_50815.wav	a first problem of the assignment is on the image charge and it says if we have the x, z and y z plane which are grounded, that means there are potential zero and we take a charge at the position charge q at the position x, naught, y, naught	train
audio_0_145382.wav	For the traditional operating system, not only that the kernel should become preemptive, that is even if it is running in the kernel mode, the kernel code is executing, still it should be able to preempt the kernel code and also we should be able to handle nested interrupts	train
audio_0_2869.wav	Shaft power means net mechanical power right	train
audio_0_181477.wav	4 like that you can sort of visualize how the different channel numbers increase	train
audio_0_190196.wav	So, this tells me how to get all the coefficients of the product, and again I will simply assert these without proof which can be checked easily and these are not difficult and they are not very illuminating to check	train
audio_0_202673.wav	Let us move on to the new example	train
audio_0_176376.wav	So in that case when we are talking about analyzing the circuit what you really are asking for determine some unknown variable in terms of known variables	train
audio_0_142982.wav	There will be report on corporate governance	train
audio_0_152111.wav	Majority of the times when we talk about privacy particularly in courses like these it is always referred to as information privacy and particularly the internet privacy	train
audio_0_69388.wav	Now, while talking about the biology of the cells we talked about the oxygen tension, oxygen and carbon dioxide very briefly of course, we will come back to this thing	train
audio_0_119291.wav	mapper three, m three has one data	train
audio_0_229123.wav	The worker who is working in manufacturing or the operator who is there, he is also skilled enough to maintain or to control the process so that is total quality management	train
audio_0_171463.wav	So, these devices can also be regarded as matching devices used to attain maximum power transfer	train
audio_0_58845.wav	it says that i change the size of the gate to achive a lower delay, like: suppose i have a circuit netlist like this: i take one gate, ah, two input nand gate which is driving three other points	train
audio_0_57559.wav	so lets use a different color, so the data will be stored here	train
audio_0_135535.wav	And this expansionist agenda of France and Belgium started causing a great deal of alarm amongst other major European powers like Britain for instance, like Portugal, like Germany	train
audio_0_157824.wav	So again everything is being searched and then both T1 and T0 needs to be redone and again the redoing operation should be done in the order in which they have committed	train
audio_0_82628.wav	We have already discussed in the last module, that when you talk about low pass filter, this would be Vout / Vin would be greater than AF	train
audio_0_161679.wav	So it can just keep on dying again and again	train
audio_0_51978.wav	This is the program for this lecture and based on what we cover today I am also going to give you an assignment, where you solve three or four problems employing these concepts	train
audio_0_154879.wav	We can also make a very shrewd guess in assessment of the broad categories of work or the nature of work with which that individual is associated, as well as we can find out a lot about the intellectual level of that person	train
audio_0_144071.wav	Now, every year whatever is a value of machinery at the beginning, we charge it at a particular rate and calculate the depreciation for that year	train
audio_0_113664.wav	So, we try to minimize that loss and for that we need to do impedance matching to prevent that power loss	train
audio_0_155406.wav	And I quote, “the young in the old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the same state of mind by the same movements”	train
audio_0_146746.wav	So, these are the dynamic scheduler where the scheduler keeps on changing the priority of the tasks and of all the dynamic priority schedulers, the EDF or the earliest deadline first scheduler is the optimal uniprocessor scheduling algorithm	train
audio_0_216951.wav	yes, there you are, now it's coming down	train
audio_0_221185.wav	On the other hand, as we have already seen, if you wanted to delete an element from the middle of a list or we want to insert an element into a list, this takes constant time, provided we are already at A i	train
audio_0_132213.wav	so this is one way of determining the heat transfer rate	train
audio_0_130102.wav	We looked at three things namely the three processes that take place in a molecule called emission, spontaneous emission, absorption in the presence of radiation and stimulated emission	train
audio_0_75327.wav	So, if this is your spin coated substrate you have your mask aligner and here is your mask	train
audio_0_55550.wav	give omega two if the slack value is negative	train
audio_0_181063.wav	The adjacent channel ones are more or less haggled completely by your receive filter	train
audio_0_212025.wav	you can see, it's a very simple, very, very simple analogue signal that you can get from this p i r sensor and let us see if she can actually ah show you in real time, if she can actually capture this signal if there is motion	train
audio_0_5311.wav	So, 1 upon R P minus j upon X P that is equal to g minus j b say	train
audio_0_53619.wav	so surface current like this, this only the outer one that carries the surface current	train
audio_0_89136.wav	Now this seems like a very good solution for solving CRP problem in PUF, there are still a lot of research before actually taking this homomorphic encryption to practice	train
audio_0_193808.wav	So, let us quickly prove this	train
audio_0_168776.wav	So, we will see how we will represent that particular phenomena with the help of a mathematical function	train
audio_0_153566.wav	For an American time is truly money and therefore, it is always considered to be precious; because this society is basically a profit oriented society Germans and Swiss link time with their sense of order tidiness and planning	train
audio_0_115265.wav	so, ah, if we look at some of the ah approaches, ah or some of the ah, um, different type of aspects, like, as we discussed previously, resource provisioning, resource allocation, and try to see that what sort of ah, what sort of approaches people are following or researchers are following ah into things like first one	train
audio_0_199910.wav	And beyond that, because it is in saturation it follows the square law equation which says that I equals muN Corks by 2, W by L, VGS minus VT, square	train
audio_0_220095.wav	So, this will be a linear time thing in proportional to the size of the components k and k prime	train
audio_0_92428.wav	So, this sum of these three just three simple functions represents this complicated behavior then we can imagine that we have if we have possibility of having many more terms or infinitely many terms that too with some coefficients here sitting with this cos and sine	train
audio_0_210746.wav	Usually, it ends, we show it something like a mark x x; that means it is a kind of plane which we are going to slice it, cut the section and show that view	train
audio_0_130946.wav	ok, so direction of steam flow is in this direction and direction of hot gas flow is in the opposite direction	train
audio_0_87938.wav	So, we will see little more detail about what a CMOS inverter looks like	train
audio_0_11409.wav	So, total average power will be then P a plus P b plus P c is equal to 3 P p, so it will be 3 V p I p cos theta right	train
audio_0_41906.wav	So, in this mid frequency range there is no escape, I have to use both the space derivative and the time derivative ok	train
audio_0_26025.wav	We do not want a full stop to come after the space	train
audio_0_104107.wav	So to summarize, we have in this just revisited the hierarchy of OOAD hierarchy concept of ISA relationship and class hierarchy concept of object oriented analysis and design, and we have introduced the basic notion of inheritance in C++ and noted what are the different aspects of semantics that we need to understand, that we need to really be master of so that we can use inheritance in an effective manner	train
audio_0_170475.wav	So you will assume that this circuit which is outside your plug point is the linear circuit and you will replace that particular segment with one equivalent circuit where you will have one voltage source and one resistance	train
audio_0_37054.wav	So, that is why it is just j yeah	train
audio_0_174164.wav	And is the CO stated in terms of student performance rather than teaching performance or subject matter to be covered	train
audio_0_192356.wav	For n positive Z mod n Z let us say n at least 2, because n equal to 1 we get the 0 ring, that is a certainly a sub ring of C	train
audio_0_116974.wav	it is not like that all are going peak at the time, all are coming down at the lower things	train
audio_0_208015.wav	Major axis is 100 mm, and distance between foci is 70 mm; that means, we have to mark a division from O, here this is 35 units and this one also 35 units	train
audio_0_119630.wav	a root tablet points to the other meta data tablets	train
audio_0_42397.wav	So, let us just sort of list out the two advantages that we will get from this ok	train
audio_0_194274.wav	So, let me define these now; so, I am going to define maximal ideals	train
audio_0_174641.wav	So in such a case it is difficult to include all the POs	train
audio_0_57032.wav	so one is this source and other is the sink	train
audio_0_111092.wav	So, that 1 is the x band waveguide generally we do because of the size etcetera also these are radar band	train
audio_0_20091.wav	You can compare here the profit as almost from 140 was the profit of last year	train
audio_0_83455.wav	When I talk about long term stability, then what we see is, basically due to aging of crystal material	train
audio_0_207405.wav	Because when I pick first point, second point, third point, I do not have any control on what should be the radius I cannot control it	train
audio_0_215673.wav	it just applying the power supply filed to the electronics of the tag, just for the improvement of range	train
audio_0_56601.wav	now here where fault simulation is used, is so, as we are generating a new test vector t i, we immediately carry out fault simulation to find out what all other faults are also getting detected by this same test vector	train
audio_0_36671.wav	So, you can straight away see what we are going to do	train
audio_0_182536.wav	So, basically now you start to see the sequence	train
audio_0_17343.wav	So, many exp[lain] examples are varieties of examples are given	train
audio_0_219206.wav	Fibonacci of 5 is not going to require Fibonacci of 6, 7, 8	train
audio_0_66458.wav	Second thing, second thing now the problem comes here see for example, you have a cylinder here just try to imagine you have a cylinder here or you have a cylinder here, the places I am circling and you have a incubator which is sitting here see for example, on this counter top I am just putting in a blue see for example, you have a incubator setting here	train
audio_0_182394.wav	I yeah, in order to write this 1 you must have starting from Q because the first chip waveform should be at the origin	train
audio_0_99309.wav	It takes care of how to initialize that top and it can be used for any type of element that I want the stack for, and the very interesting and exciting part of the whole C++ programming and standard library is that the story does not stop just with stack	train
audio_0_187282.wav	If you have a matrix which is of dimension 5 and let us say the size of null space is 2,then this basically means that there are 2 relationships among these 5 variables, which also automatically means that of these 5 variables only 3 are linearly independent because the 2 relationships would let you calculate the dependent variables as a function of these independent variables	train
audio_0_220921.wav	So, I am extracting elements from the tree in descending order, and so I get a sorted output	train
audio_0_80755.wav	In the last module, we have seen low pass filter; that means, the frequency below critical frequencies were allowed to pass right, band frequencies below for critical frequencies were allowed to pass while in case of high pass filter the band of frequencies above critical frequencies are allowed to pass	train
audio_0_204023.wav	We can see it has a it cannot rotate fully, let us just fix this item ok; click on fix	train
audio_0_72954.wav	So you can see that the advantages of this technique payback payback is that that it is simple to calculate, no, not particularly sensitive to small forecasting errors, but it has some drawbacks like it ignores the overall profitability of the project	train
audio_0_103490.wav	How to form them into expression using operators	train
audio_0_27346.wav	The initial value is by default none unless I provide you an initial value in which case you create a list with that value and because of our assumption about empty list all we need to do to check whether a list is empty is to check whether the value at the initial node is none or not	train
audio_0_14971.wav	So, now V is equal to your 4 i because ah 4 ohm resistance is there, so across 4 ohm resistance the voltage is V is equal to 4 i	train
audio_0_234814.wav	Emotional demands at work	train
audio_0_233929.wav	Then, we have action learning	train
audio_0_157096.wav	Now, to break the deadlock, one of them must be aborted	train
audio_0_23736.wav	My name is Heet Thakkar	train
audio_0_39136.wav	So, this r y y prime equal to 0 never happens and we need that because we are actually dividing by 1 by r right	train
audio_0_56564.wav	so the circuit will be slowed down	train
audio_0_110075.wav	Now, application you see when a person, suppose there is an earthquake or an avalanche and then a person is buried under that earthquake, debris or due to the snow of the avalanche	train
audio_0_61159.wav	ok, similarly here, in the normal mode the output of the circuit will go to the p o, the primary inputs, but during the test mode you have something called a response compactor inside the chip	train
audio_0_74680.wav	So, if you have an axis of tissue elasticity, versus lamin A to lamin B stoichiometry	train
audio_0_37315.wav	Equation 4 is telling me what; equation 4 is talking about H n plus half right	train
audio_0_56568.wav	so the clock will also get degraded	train
audio_0_228677.wav	So, what if we multiply the errors with a constant	train
audio_0_180351.wav	Now, since we have already computed it for BPSK, we just by substituting showed that q of root beta gamma, if that is BER in AWGN, then the probability of error in fading will be one half of 1 minus square root of beta Gamma by 2 plus beta Gamma and the asymptotic behavior will be 1 over 2 beta Gamma	train
audio_0_185130.wav	2kbps	train
audio_0_85210.wav	So, when VGS is extremely less than V T, or less than equal to VT we have current ID equals to 0 you can see here the current is 0 right because my VGS is equals to threshold voltage or is less than threshold voltage ok	train
audio_0_112273.wav	So, based on that now prohibited regions are limitations of 2 sections matching, always it is not guaranteed that you will be able to come out by any topology, but if you choose the proper topology then whatever way we have shown you would not be in the prohibited region	train
audio_0_9426.wav	This energy stored in the capacitor that that is your what you call half cv square or half c q square right	train
audio_0_176065.wav	Let us not elaborate on cognitivist and constructivist tradition	train
audio_0_148323.wav	Later in the course we will start looking at trust and credibility which is how much can you actually delete the content that are posted on Twitter or Facebook	train
audio_0_101380.wav	The outline will comprise these two kinds of members, and we will have a discussion about singleton classes	train
audio_0_205605.wav	So, this is out of paper	train
audio_0_12239.wav	Therefore, R is equal to W s c upon I s c square	train
audio_0_18836.wav	Suppose, it is given that switch is that the switch is closed at t is equal to 0; that means, initially switch was open	train
audio_0_212552.wav	and if you look at data distribution data, this is mostly one to one	train
audio_0_173166.wav	Documentation itself is a/can be a major learning tool	train
audio_0_67500.wav	i will give all the papers what i have promised they will be uploaded and apart from it, i will give you two more small modules of ah micro channel technology which will help you to realize some of the other application of the mems fabrication which are being used, and apart from it, you will have skew papers on micro electrode arrays and if it is in cell culture and achieving electrical excitability	train
audio_0_40999.wav	These waves interfere right and you observe, interference pattern appears over here ok	train
audio_0_25663.wav	So it is also now alpha and the mechanism of this is, I can write it down, the mechanism is given here	train
audio_0_180565.wav	So, that it is our broad classification of understanding	train
audio_0_145421.wav	But if you are given a save command and at the same time you are able to also do editing and other operations, then it's a asynchronous I	train
audio_0_170119.wav	Now, let us understand the model, mechanical model which we just discussed with the help of one example	train
audio_0_213975.wav	what is interesting is this quiescent current right	train
audio_0_21653.wav	You need sale units are already given which is 20,000	train
audio_0_129632.wav	so we eliminate those currents all together by forming a super node, as usual one	train
audio_0_175236.wav	So what would happen, depending on which are the key phrases it is focusing on or how many it is focusing on we can associate a strength to which the course outcome is mapped on to a given PO or a PSO	train
audio_0_13916.wav	61right	train
audio_0_12242.wav	Therefore, this is my Z we got	train
audio_0_194725.wav	This VGS minus VT will be 3 volts minus 0	train
audio_0_151109.wav	So here are the sets of features that Paradi actually used in our work	train
audio_0_46560.wav	I 0 is the load current	train
audio_0_158391.wav	So, if one enforces the conflict serializability, those schedules are not going to be allowed by the database engine	train
audio_0_104772.wav	So, you do not care about the name of the formal parameter at all	train
audio_0_239198.wav	Because, appraisals measure, what you could have done	train
audio_0_64533.wav	so i have named the different lines accordingly	train
audio_0_39563.wav	So, they have their own update equations to get I mean they have their own algebra to get an update equation, but we will not deal with that in this	train
audio_0_176468.wav	Now there are two other words that are of concern	train
audio_0_31456.wav	Is a scalar, right	train
audio_0_18711.wav	It will complete 2 cycles right	train
audio_0_80759.wav	So, now if I draw a gain versus frequency what I see is that I will have a plot like this, I will have a plot which is which is exactly opposite to that of a low pass filter	train
audio_0_123797.wav	ok, so the voltage here across port one is the series combination of these two resistors, two kilo ohms times i one, where, as the voltage across port two is i one times this resistor, one kilo ohm	train
audio_0_27201.wav	So, is nothing tells you this is one line part of a line more than a line you have to write s according to the way you want it to be written on the file, if you want it to be in one line you should make sure it ends with a backslash n	train
audio_0_52230.wav	let us calculated using the other expression that we had derived, where we have said that energy is also given as one over four pi epsilon zero	train
audio_0_12679.wav	And that is actually done here; that is actually done here right	train
audio_0_14596.wav	First thing is that that when will ah when you have a dependent your ah sources in the network, you just cannot ah [pu/put] put them off right, only independent sources can be put it off	train
audio_0_179908.wav	We move on to the lecture number 6 where we introduce the concepts of antennas, break point model and the other	train
audio_0_36919.wav	It turns out that if you make a further approximation of ignoring this term also	train
audio_0_94374.wav	you have to state your own point of view, but not at the cost of your it ill behaviour or in an ill man, in an ill manner	train
audio_0_29238.wav	So, it says that 47	train
audio_0_98527.wav	This is the very, very interesting part and this is what we will particularly focus on here	train
audio_0_203860.wav	So, at any arbitrary angle, I can really construct a plane	train
audio_0_239007.wav	And, it should be taken into account, when our supervisors ask us to do certain things	train
audio_0_232815.wav	Wish you success in whatever endeavor that you take in your life, wish you happiness and peace also	train
audio_0_168580.wav	So, this is something which you have to keep in mind because here the unit is step function is u minus t it means that the value of unit step function is like this were you have a value at time t is equal to, less than t is equal to 0 but it is 0, when t greater than 0	train
audio_0_32078.wav	Their edges I mean they do not like edges what they are concerned about is, like fluid flow they are concerned about how much fluid is flowing across a certain interface	train
audio_0_157085.wav	Because if it is zero meaning nobody from R has caught it and R is suppose the left outer joint is done in the left outer joint manner	train
audio_0_146006.wav	So, in cases where deadline is not equal to the period, rate monotonic algorithm is not really the optimal scheduling strategy	train
audio_0_157807.wav	It has changed it from 3 to 9, and T1 is changing B from 2 to 5	train
audio_0_61488.wav	the constraints types can be two types	train
audio_0_169431.wav	Now, the polarity of voltages that is on primary and secondary side of the transformer and the direction of current I1, I2 that is again primary current and the secondary current	train
audio_0_102108.wav	Of course, as I said there could be some pitfalls	train
audio_0_92074.wav	So, when we put this n is equal to 2 what will happen from this relation that the Laplace of t square will be 2 over this s from here	train
audio_0_103405.wav	Other data types in C include void	train
audio_0_226428.wav	Now, the first issue distributional let to discuss here is Poisson distribution	train
audio_0_149803.wav	I already said about LinkedIn, Foursquare, Google Plus, Periscope	train
audio_0_59400.wav	so slicing structure actually tells you how to slice a floor plan repeatedly until you get the basic blocks	train
audio_0_171202.wav	05 Siemens	train
audio_0_115499.wav	detection: detect attackers, violation of the security policy	train
audio_0_189178.wav	So, if you specify this K as a number, let's say three clusters, what it does is it will choose a random set of distinct rows in this numeric matrix X as the initial centers	train
audio_0_118352.wav	cloud work, load profiling and deployment control again another important aspects, and if you see, these are the things which are not exact	train
audio_0_28166.wav	So here is that global code	train
audio_0_80897.wav	Now, input voltage range high how high or low voltage the input pins can be applied before Op amp does not function properly there is called input offset voltage ranges	train
audio_0_204047.wav	I can see the ball is fit into this curved slide	train
audio_0_165929.wav	You have to simply see what are the delta branches adjacent to R1	train
audio_0_79580.wav	So, this kind of mode is particularly suited for soft loosely attached samples	train
audio_0_56213.wav	so if a shortest path of length l exist after l steps, you are guaranteed to find that path and it will touch that point	train
audio_0_176289.wav	And then you have to calculate, what do you calculate	train
audio_0_100026.wav	We have separate processing function for engineer, which takes an engineer pointer and manager which takes a manager pointer and finally, these are collection store as I said	train

audio_0_32581.wav	Is begin call it because they are we are not exiting the force because I does not the	train
audio_0_182747.wav	So, let me call this one of them as equation number 1, and the other one as equation number 2	train
audio_0_121554.wav	So, if many withdrawers from the space that she shared with the male companions, it is a withdrawal that prepares her for her domestic life in her in laws home	train
audio_0_204693.wav	So, we have a continuous line	train
audio_0_115896.wav	that we get a positive number and it is ah	train
audio_0_83703.wav	So, in this particular case; I will use this common mode signal, I will use the common mode gain, differential gain; to understand a very important property which is called thecommon mode rejection ratio; a very important term for an operational amplifier	train
audio_0_115067.wav	in doing so we may ah, may in the ah or may, basically formulate a scenario where this ah, where there is healthy collaborations between the things, without security violences	train
audio_0_229178.wav	So, whether it is a common or normal range of variation the control charts has upper control limit it has U	train
audio_0_200752.wav	So there has to be some path for this current and that is this resistance, RD	train
audio_0_225271.wav	Find tells us which partition a given element belongs to and union combines two components or two partitions into a single one	train
audio_0_134947.wav	So, they are basically the best examples of any concept that comes to your mind the moment you think of that every concept	train
audio_0_208369.wav	Mark A, somewhere B and in middle line horizontal perpendicular thing, we can construct CC prime	train
audio_0_46191.wav	You see that there is a Q and then there is NG sim now the Q Sim is an octave script which which takes care of the issue of this netlist command generating net list command and also to show you the waveforms using octave or matlap type of commands and also to put an output in the form of a PDF file	train
audio_0_101765.wav	We will talk more about it subsequently	train
audio_0_213558.wav	right, this is connected through an s	train
audio_0_174042.wav	That is descriptions and examples of goals, knowledge needed and the performances expected	train
audio_0_99352.wav	So I want a function like this	train
audio_0_237718.wav	Fairness and justice, proposed by John Rawls	train
audio_0_149085.wav	If you arrange the spam followers in the node rank which is the number of followers that they may have is actually very high	train
audio_0_173979.wav	And learning and development as we will see in later units can be looked at 4 levels	train
audio_0_11489.wav	So, Z p is given 10 plus j 8 ohm that is 12	train
audio_0_121029.wav	He has let me down the ungrateful wretch, Appa shouted	train
audio_0_130245.wav	so this is conversion of chemical energy from a fuel directly into electricity	train
audio_0_50719.wav	make this similar to a ring with current i going around in the phi direction and the corresponding b	train
audio_0_100605.wav	This is very very important which we look at is often the exception does not happen in the main, it will happen in function which is in a deep nested call; main has called one function; that has called another function; that has called yet another function and so on	train
audio_0_57117.wav	suppose this has five, this has seven	train
audio_0_103526.wav	It will never get fragmented that one part of the object is in one part of memory and other part is another part of the memory	train
audio_0_198158.wav	So, this is the topology	train
audio_0_210798.wav	On the sections are generated from cone by slicing it; so such kind of sections are called conic sections, and these are very powerful curves in engineering applications	train
audio_0_135562.wav	And this was a sign of progress because the slave trade had considerably depleted the African population	train
audio_0_135289.wav	This is called Proactive Interference	train
audio_0_61475.wav	the only thing you can compact is rows	train
audio_0_207116.wav	So, based on both the views only, we will be in a position to understand how the three dimensional projection of this object	train
audio_0_46494.wav	There will be a small ripple which will have the same similar shape as that of VC divided by R	train
audio_0_239985.wav	And it stays, the effect stays only for a little while	train
audio_0_26796.wav	8, and this is not a list, but a tuple	train
audio_0_209536.wav	First step is always double clicking, then it opens a window, you pick part drawing, then go draw the path drawing, and then regularly save the file by drawing the things	train
audio_0_112676.wav	You will have to find out what is an input impedance and admittance of the transmission line given in figure	train
audio_0_123800.wav	so the looking in resistance into port two is just one kilo ohm and thats what we see	train
audio_0_46565.wav	So once you have taken care of the worst case condition for minimum ripple, maximum value of I not, the value of C will hold good	train
audio_0_179865.wav	So, it is not always true that an FDD system will require a duplex there are exceptions and this happens to be an exception	train
audio_0_158261.wav	So, for each data item X, if there is a data item X, transaction T1 reads X and transaction T2 reads X	train
audio_0_88538.wav	The detection of hardware Trojan is a very hot topic of research especially in the last decade or so and there have been several interesting papers and techniques that have been discussed and presented in order to detect such hardware Trojans	train
audio_0_26315.wav	For instance, we can now rewrite our Pythagorean triples to say that, x is in range 100, but y does not start at 0; it starts from x onwards	train
audio_0_56669.wav	so what we do here, in every pass of the simulation we simulate the fault free circuits as well as w minus one of the faulty version	train
audio_0_29922.wav	Which is a psychological part of it, the stimuli is the social part of it and amygdala and the frontal cortex responses the pure neuroscientific nerve neuronal	train
audio_0_47655.wav	let us now start by placing the x and y axis now I have here three x axis which is the time axis and on the y axis we have the y axis we have three important things VG is nothing but the gate signal which will be applying at this point	train
audio_0_52886.wav	we have already seen in one of the lectures earlier that this is done by a uniform magnetization	train
audio_0_204750.wav	So, we will see it like a triangle	train
audio_0_12967.wav	And this circuit can be equivalent to this one at terminal 1 and 2, but v i characteristic at terminal one and two has to be same for both the cases right	train
audio_0_98336.wav	So, it is a int int call	train
audio_0_112535.wav	You see in the uploaded smith chart you can take because there is software freely available in internet which is call black magic design, I think the people who have done that they have put you can download that also we have kept sample copies of this things in your extra material portion of this course	train
audio_0_153935.wav	Oculesics help us to understand what is the level of comprehension of a particular topic	train
audio_0_193959.wav	So, let us try to recall the statement of the theorem we have made three statements here	train
audio_0_100131.wav	This is happening because if you look into the a object this as a int	train
audio_0_172715.wav	And for a 4 credit course like 4:0:0 you are likely to have about 54 classroom sessions	train
audio_0_55956.wav	so again, so how to layout the different nets, using metal connections typically, so that the signal delays conform to our constraints or requirements	train
audio_0_240173.wav	It is the process of verifying that, there is a performance deficiency, and determining, whether the employer should correct, such deficiencies through training, or some other means like, transferring the employee	train
audio_0_127797.wav	so, when you have a short circuit, saying that resistance is zero is legitimate representation	train
audio_0_202484.wav	There are variety of holes and so on so, things like counter bores countersinks and so on there are special symbols people usually use it	train
audio_0_30751.wav	It so we exclude that area or volume from the computation by means of a hole right, so this is the hole ok	train
audio_0_237202.wav	So, in the first theory, we talked about the material resources, that we had	train
audio_0_33579.wav	And so, this gauge condition and all has to be seen little bit more carefully	train
audio_0_77119.wav	However, you will not see the effect of contractility on stiffness if your cortical contractility does not change, is unchanged	train
audio_0_13072.wav	So, slowly and slowly come down	train
audio_0_212731.wav	first thing that will happen is when the client wants to connect to the broker, he might even give this name: nptel, dot, example	train
audio_0_207365.wav	Now, we are done with that circle	train
audio_0_131103.wav	we want to maximize rho cp	train
audio_0_32183.wav	So, residual was the difference was you know the difference between L phi and f	train
audio_0_213416.wav	you will see that zenlabs um joule jotter app opens	train
audio_0_78599.wav	So, it mimics the brain soft range	train
audio_0_39064.wav	Line charge	train
audio_0_223620.wav	Now, in this graph every time a line crosses this indicates a mismatch, so 2 has a gone ahead of 1, likewise 4 is gone ahead of 3 and so on	train
audio_0_225738.wav	It is important to realize that not every algorithm admits an efficient solution	train
audio_0_67172.wav	And the single cell suspension means essentially if you dissociate this tissue if you dissociate the tissue what you will be getting is something like this	train
audio_0_41974.wav	Now you can see that if I calculate at this point over here, the vector field is sort of diverging away from one point	train
audio_0_49329.wav	question number two: we have a uniformly charged spherical shell	train
audio_0_37783.wav	Can I write H naught in this form right	train
audio_0_97733.wav	Now, she is back into the integration	train
audio_0_36814.wav	It should come back	train
audio_0_185958.wav	Nonetheless if I had 2 equality constraints I need to find the 2 extra equations which are directly given by the constraints	train
audio_0_181522.wav	And if I went higher with the TDMA system what will happen the time duration will reduce and my equalizer will become more complex	train
audio_0_225514.wav	So, you could have bigger values in the second row in the smaller row and vice versa	train
audio_0_225165.wav	So, then in a nutshell when I do and upward swap like this I can be sure that do not have to look on the other side I just keep looking up	train
audio_0_137617.wav	So in such cases also even if the plan does not include an integrator having a proportional control is okay, but there are various situations where and, a steady state offset cannot be tolerated, in such a case obviously you must go for PI control	train
audio_0_83575.wav	So, the value is 6 millivolts, 6	train
audio_0_93949.wav	now, since space is also culturally regulated, different cultures have different space meanings	train
audio_0_181493.wav	Basically it is proportional to the carrier frequency	train
audio_0_154018.wav	It can be helpful in learning the motivation level of other people and it can also help us to understand what is the stage of decision making	train
audio_0_135754.wav	And, this was followed by a year of fellowship at the University of Cambridge	train
audio_0_224955.wav	So, moving the predecessor here I guaranty there anything that is to their height, remains bigger then this node and everything to the left remains smaller then this node, because that was the biggest values	train
audio_0_6405.wav	2; 3	train
audio_0_6343.wav	So, current source it should be turned off	train
audio_0_195895.wav	It has two input terminals and the difference voltage is called VD	train
audio_0_99524.wav	Now, when the derive class inherits the constructor and destructor of base class, but you have to be very cautious it is with the different semantics	train
audio_0_78467.wav	So, let us say focal complexes you have focal adhesions and let us say fibrillar adhesions	train
audio_0_35414.wav	So, surface integral methods	train
audio_0_178418.wav	So, the channel is absolutely stationary; once you done the estimate you are good to go	train
audio_0_55175.wav	so you do all these things so that these timing constraints, whatever was there was made, physical synthesis is done	train
audio_0_30182.wav	Like what happen social anxiety yeah	train
audio_0_79856.wav	Because there is a amplification involved there is an amplification involved, right	train
audio_0_222661.wav	So, one of the thing that you can observe is that most of the entries in this matrix are actually 0	train
audio_0_152900.wav	It is considered to be confrontational and highly offensive	train
audio_0_229828.wav	Today you can see beautiful things have come	train
audio_0_148915.wav	65 percent of users choose a new username unrelated to the old name, while 35 percent reused an old one sometime later	train
audio_0_92577.wav	So, now the question is whether we can have a N out of this ln by ln such that for all n greater than N, we have this relation	train
audio_0_46166.wav	So you say NG Spice rectifier	train
audio_0_81785.wav	Now, if if we know we have studied right, in operational amplifiers 741, we apply plus 15, we apply minus 15	train
audio_0_176682.wav	Now, coming to our undergraduate engineering programs there are four levels of outcomes identified	train
audio_0_210089.wav	The key property of spline functions is that they and their derivatives may be continuous depending on the multiplicity of knots, how complicated these knots we might be having smooth curves	train
audio_0_175641.wav	But you have to think in terms of what is the relevant engineering knowledge that you want the student to be aware of	train
audio_0_77197.wav	So, for a cell which is stiffer and more contractile its deadhesion timescale will be lower	train
audio_0_150517.wav	I am, I am sure by now you already realized the privacy concerns in location based services which are, where my location is shared, if my location is shared there are going to be concerns accordingly, that is, somebody else will get to know where I am, if the information is given public, then many more people actually, more than just your friends get access to your location at that given point in time, right	train
audio_0_101501.wav	So, which means it cannot access non static data members of the class	train
audio_0_104699.wav	I have done the typeids, these are the two outputs, and it is fine, nothing new	train
audio_0_60128.wav	ok, the next step says to extend this lines till the hit obstructions or the boundary of the layout	train
audio_0_147908.wav	So, I am just enumerating different, using these examples and what I am trying to do is to enumerate the different problems that happen on social media	train
audio_0_174783.wav	And people did find some reservations about some of the things and there was a committee that in around 2000 year 2000 they sat down and looked at the experiences feedback that was given	train
audio_0_198683.wav	So, now the important thing is that this is a ratio but this is evaluated at zero frequency and this is evaluated at a frequency of omega not	train
audio_0_231188.wav	We measure the pressure change into a length change; one parameter is getting converted into other parameter	train
audio_0_170302.wav	Sometimes these types of equations are difficult to solve when the circuit is more complex	train
audio_0_139769.wav	Now when, in this way again when state 2 is on, at that time in the next cycle some other transition will become enabled depending on what sensors signals are coming	train
audio_0_217184.wav	you will have to take a potentiometer and basically tune, keep changing the value of the potentiometer	train
audio_0_209844.wav	So, we have two points c and c'; this is the locus line	train
audio_0_39365.wav	The quadrature rule which I had derived for Lagrange polynomials	train
audio_0_110140.wav	So, basement wise also there is a clear cut demarcation in the in any system if you look in any radar system in any communication system the RF’s, they are at the forefront when they are pumping the power to the free space or outside world and the backend that is generally the RF and non RF things	train
audio_0_102993.wav	So, you can define a handler and you can give different signals	train
audio_0_39284.wav	Now, you are abstracted the idea for dot product from vectors to functions and you can talk about orthogonality right	train
audio_0_1676.wav	So, going clock wise this way	train
audio_0_213064.wav	basically, you should ensure that the l t c ah three, one zero five never shuts down and does not get thoroughly overloaded by the output	train
audio_0_167216.wav	Now, two terminal devices or elements which we discussed till now such as resistors, capacitors, inductors are called as a one port network	train
audio_0_119858.wav	that is where this particular ah web app will reside	train
audio_0_191582.wav	So, that is the first condition for a vector space and we can certainly multiply an element of K with an element of F	train
audio_0_19985.wav	1 and for sale prices they are increasing by 8%	train
audio_0_204755.wav	Then, transfer this a point precisely to that location	train
audio_0_155773.wav	However, the rate of a speech is relatively slow we normally cannot speak for more than 150 words per minute	train
audio_0_201603.wav	So, this point to that point, this projector length is 0	train
audio_0_203725.wav	So, this is the plane what we are talking about	train
audio_0_106822.wav	Say, an employee in an organization comes out with an invention	train
audio_0_59812.wav	a is one or b is one, so a is one	train
audio_0_52315.wav	Note one, if x is 0 F is equal to 0; that make sense, because of this charge is here	train
audio_0_222305.wav	Then we can represent the structure of the graph through an adjacency matrix	train
audio_0_16708.wav	074 has to be subtracted for that it is becoming 0	train
audio_0_188748.wav	Now similarly if you take a point here while it satis es constraint 1 and 3 it will violate constraint 2	train
audio_0_83226.wav	Do something that is your homework, do something by yourself understand how the noise is generated all right	train
audio_0_21386.wav	Now as per our, we are trying to close Y, sorry, close Z and Z will release 1,000 25,000 rupees of raw material, which will be used for Y	train
audio_0_42246.wav	The unknowns are the inside and outside or only inside the integral sine	train
audio_0_104526.wav	Please try to understand this more clearly so that any confusion about dynamic dispatch would be clear in your mind	train
audio_0_133439.wav	So, you have the lip pressor, the lips part, the jaw drop and the mouth stretch	train
audio_0_132910.wav	so you really dont have a large chunk coming out at very high speed which, if it hits something, can be fatal at those high speeds	train
audio_0_146145.wav	It means that for a given task set even if a clock driven scheduler cannot find a schedule it can be easily executed but the feasible schedule can be obtained using the event driven scheduler	train
audio_0_51442.wav	so this is the well known example we've been solving so far, and i want to calculate for the vector potential directly	train
audio_0_86756.wav	So, notice that the locations which we need to modify is at an offset 473 and 47d in the object file	train
audio_0_118086.wav	right, provides authentication and authorization service for other open stack services	train
audio_0_223615.wav	So, there are four inversions in this particular list between your ranking and your friends ranking and our goal is to count this number of inversions given to permutations	train
audio_0_78993.wav	So, this again conveys to you why the thickness of the gel is paramount and how the basement membrane being very thin can be helpful for forces being transmitted across the basement membrane	train
audio_0_78394.wav	So, imagine you have a cell	train
audio_0_142702.wav	Now the similar acts were introduced by many countries in the world	train
audio_0_1402.wav	And rotating part it is called the armature right, where mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy for generator or conversely electrical energy into mechanical energy for motor	train
audio_0_43029.wav	If you make p very high	train
audio_0_28332.wav	So, we can continue doing this row by row, and eventually we find look there are 1363 paths which avoid these two	train
audio_0_8385.wav	An inductor is an electrical your electrical component right that that opposes any change in electrical current little bit you know about from your physics	train
audio_0_38866.wav	So, let us write it actually need not be it is easy to deal with it right	train
audio_0_19642.wav	Although they have given some fixed costs	train
audio_0_225253.wav	So, to summarize go to we have seen is that heaps implement priority queues using special balance trees, in these tree both insert and delete max are logarithmic we can use this bottom up heapify to actually build a heap and order N time	train
audio_0_83769.wav	It should be low	train
audio_0_55807.wav	lets say, here i am looking at a particular point, not both x and y, but particular point x	train
audio_0_184024.wav	Now, use this information to scramble scramble this, and you are going to do something very very interesting you are going to puncture some data out of your sequence this is user data has already put into a very complicated format	train
audio_0_142398.wav	Now do you know or do you remember any festival which is associated with that period	train
audio_0_93867.wav	if you are alert and if you listen and if the thought process of the speaker ignites your fire or activates you, naturally you will take down precise notes and when you do that you will fail that the entire listening have been a sort of learning experience	train
audio_0_101479.wav	With that, now naturally here so these are the two static data members these are initialized constructed and initialize at this point and then I do a whole lot of tasks	train
audio_0_57981.wav	so this graph will essentially be a planer triangular graph, which you have to translate into into a floor plan	train
audio_0_58043.wav	now top down is the other alternative	train
audio_0_75208.wav	Essentially you are floor to floor distance has to be less than 70 angstroms to be detected by this method	train
audio_0_5997.wav	So, this is actually this currents source we are now now we are you have seen that your what you call a dependent voltage source and your dependent current source, both are dependent on either voltage or current right now	train
audio_0_5921.wav	So many things are written here, but whatever I am telling meaning is same right	train
audio_0_67805.wav	You are almost trying to mimic that organ in our dish and that will take us to lab on a chip concept third point now three d and 3D pattern	train
audio_0_199465.wav	So really in this circuit, although I called it sensing at the source and feeding back to the gate, we are sensing at the source, that is correct, but the feedback is both to the source and the gate and both are in the appropriate directions	train
audio_0_155887.wav	So if R is being used as the outer loop, then this is the cost	train
audio_0_123414.wav	the first have to circuit is nothing, but something that follows differential equation of first order	train
audio_0_167154.wav	So this is a transfer function of the system and in case of signal we write the transfer function near to that particular node	train
audio_0_200409.wav	So let's now connect a current source and find the voltage that develops across it	train
audio_0_159808.wav	This is only	train
audio_0_188400.wav	The first equation is basically x 1 plus 3 x 2 equals 7 and the second equation is 2 x 1 plus 4 x 2 equals 10	train
audio_0_34572.wav	I am calculating E at every time instant of the Yee cell right	train
audio_0_56556.wav	g is the total number of gates in combinational logic, plus if n	train
audio_0_224598.wav	Because, when you make a recursive call, when you make a function call in general in a programming language, what happens is the current function that you computing has to be suspended	train
audio_0_26271.wav	In this case, we squared and that will be our output	train
audio_0_94039.wav	you actually have to have a sort of analysis of yourself	train
audio_0_38808.wav	But yeah, we will not go more into this because we will have a dedicated module for studying finite difference methods ok	train
audio_0_60134.wav	in this example, it is so that identified as trail lines of level zero which we store temporarily for further processing	train
audio_0_201102.wav	This is all we have in our small signal model now	train
audio_0_38848.wav	Such a exactly whatever dot dot dot right	train
audio_0_178361.wav	So, basically the intent is to derive the coherence time	train
audio_0_217195.wav	ah, they are the	train
audio_0_173357.wav	Or saying that the level of achievement of outcome is the basis for planning and implementing instructs	train
audio_0_95798.wav	welcome back to n p t e l online lectures on soft skills	train
audio_0_60910.wav	so my new layout of the compaction will look something like this: these are the blocks connected to the first grid	train
audio_0_186286.wav	With this we end the R module for this course	train
audio_0_14697.wav	So, finally, if you draw this circuit, so i N is equal to 3 ampere, R N is equal to 50 ohm, ,and this and you want to ah, we want to find out the current also through that 50 ohm resistance	train
audio_0_448.wav	So, at no load or full or at this load field current will remain same, again it is 1 ampere	train
audio_0_219098.wav	So, we just saw the Fibonacci of 5, this 5, we know that we start with 0, 1, 1, so these are the arguments	train
audio_0_186574.wav	So, I explained how in an unsupervised fashion you can actually start making sense out of data	train
audio_0_45480.wav	We have here the circuit of the boost converter and like before we will form the VJT symbol Q and the base drive is given here as pulses	train
audio_0_102259.wav	So, we just want to put them side by side the first string followed by the second string and make one concatenated string	train
audio_0_102878.wav	So, if you just go back to the; I am sorry, want to go back to the previous slide	train
audio_0_28807.wav	So, I am going increasing the order of index in both words and I can group together these things and this is what the longest kind of subsequences	train
audio_0_181691.wav	So, again each of them have got certain advantages disadvantages, but at the end of the day, what is the net benefit or average benefit	train
audio_0_119980.wav	so one of the aspects of this cloud is ah its energy consumption	train
audio_0_95497.wav	but remember listening is one of the key ingredients of communication	train
audio_0_56651.wav	what is a logic simulation tool	train
audio_0_38199.wav	So, one integration is going to help me with that	train

audio_0_106313.wav	The Britishers when they were ruling the country, they had brought in the patents act of 1911 which was largely the British act itself, but soon after independence, it was felt that because patents are tied closely to the development of a nation, it was felt that India required its own patent law	train
audio_0_115437.wav	it can be attack on modification that, this attack on integrity of that data, ah, right, so, or even the origin, right source, is sending to d, but in between there is a intruder, i, which intercept the message, changes the message and send it to d	train
audio_0_176650.wav	So these are all the advantages of outcome based education	train
audio_0_204927.wav	You just give the name 1, 2, 3 kind of names, tag what we call and its X coordinates its Y coordinates	train

audio_0_236402.wav	They do not want programs, that do not allow them, to participate and decide, the flow of things	train
audio_0_71403.wav	With this now we will go to the detailed steps of this cost benefit analysis which is very very important for successful development of project	train
audio_0_67486.wav	so in such systems you cannot rampantly use any kind of neurotransmitters so easily, because they are so fragile they are	train
audio_0_30157.wav	You very interestingly mentioned see I might be punctual, but if someday I because of some reason I compromise with my punctuality or say if two of us have to meet and I am punctual and for some reason you could not maintain that that should not create unrest within me	train
audio_0_26908.wav	So, this is for example like say for x in l	train
audio_0_31264.wav	Our equation becomes del 2 by del r 2 G of r	train

audio_0_114718.wav	are used physical infrastructure	train
audio_0_63905.wav	so whatever is here, q, q, and one will be q bar and q bar and one will be q, so whatever is stored will remain right	train
audio_0_27905.wav	So just to reiterate, supposing we have a stack implemented as a list and we only allow public methods push and pop, a person who is exploiting this fact that it is a list could directly add something to the end and violate the heap property for instance or the stack property	train
audio_0_83439.wav	So, as the time increases, or or when did when the temperature is changed, or when it is aging by thiswith time, then the frequency of the crystals, tends to change slightly	train

audio_0_97080.wav	Since, it was not dynamically allocated from the free store there is no sense of doing a delete there, because the memory manager did not actually get you that memory	train
audio_0_215846.wav	you can see a black spot here, a black spot here and back black spot there	train
audio_0_189832.wav	For example, one could may be come up with something like this or one could may be come up with things where I just do something like this and so, on	train
audio_0_113736.wav	So, that is why we are making it as sum of two parts; one part is the first part power delivered by the wave emitted by source at T d time back, just one journey time back plus power delivered by infinite number of waves emitted by source at n T d time back	train
audio_0_187911.wav	So, all of these things it is indicating that there is a really strong association between x and y	train
audio_0_120165.wav	So, they make this complaint to his wife, Mir's wife, the Begum, and they say that everybody in the neighborhood is talking and complaining about it and the game is an evil game and whoever plays this game of chess will never prosper	train

audio_0_55577.wav	you just incrementally update it	train
audio_0_164700.wav	So with this we can close our today's session in which we discussed about the unbalanced three phase system	train
audio_0_64695.wav	so in a similar way, i again pick the blocks randomly, i place them here until my limit of ten is again reached	train
audio_0_176698.wav	That means just at the end of 4 years these represent what is the knowledge, skills and attitudes they should have	train
audio_0_48227.wav	remember now i am doing it over a cube which is centred at the origin, like the previous example	train

audio_0_39630.wav	So, the simulation started at t is equal to 0 and the next instance there was a e to the j omega t term	train
audio_0_76663.wav	So, if you pick up the protein such that all these B domains are here and all these A domains are here B will not contribute to your signature, suggesting that this long gap of almost 0 force is a consequence of your domain A, but you do not know for sure	train
audio_0_122402.wav	And I will give you an example of the uneven kind of knowledge that Nani Amma has	train
audio_0_4380.wav	So, this is for figure c for figure a and figure b right	train
audio_0_146087.wav	Now the next thing is to select the frame size and we have to see that it satisfies three constraints	train
audio_0_224750.wav	So, if I do this n minus 1 times k is n minus 1 then n minus k becomes 1 and this n minus 1	train

audio_0_237822.wav	Disparate treatment decision rules with, racial sexual premise or cause	train
audio_0_50353.wav	in this lecture we address this question	train
audio_0_104795.wav	I mean, see the only way to return is by copying the value back; because at this point, the function funct which was executing is terminated; will get terminated after giving you the value	train
audio_0_228615.wav	So, measured value is equal to the mean value plus error, ok	train
audio_0_145963.wav	So, 100, 200 and so sorry 100, 300 and 400 the LCM is 1200 and therefore we need to maintain the schedule for 1,200 milliseconds and then keep on repeating that	train
audio_0_65118.wav	so so, although the wire lengths are the same, the capacity and resistive effects may be different	train
audio_0_1106.wav	So, I mean there should not be any confusion r f is equal to smaller r f right	train
audio_0_121594.wav	And once the calculator comes into the picture, he realizes that he has been dethroned by this material, this electronic device	train
audio_0_166085.wav	Now the question would come how you will verify whether you have written the all the equations which are required for the analysis	train
audio_0_221393.wav	You have to now compute those paths, which go through both the intersections and add them back and this combinatorial is called inclusion and exclusion	train
audio_0_82627.wav	So, if you go to the next slide now	train
audio_0_76383.wav	So, what you track is the Z position, Z pos in short and the deflection	train
audio_0_149914.wav	So, let me just show you one of them which are developer dot yahoo dot com slash geo slash placefinder	train
audio_0_39052.wav	Now, if I ask you what is let us say, the voltage at some point over here V of r	train
audio_0_219980.wav	So, this is my new question, I want to minimize this and then this becomes another LP problem and I solve that and it turns out that the dual and the original have a solution if and only if that solution is the optimum for both	train
audio_0_57047.wav	ok, this, of course, will determine, or be determined by the wire length and also on the resistance and capacitive resistive and capacitive effects that the r c delays in the other parasitic effects	train
audio_0_95769.wav	but then of course you can also plan	train
audio_0_208949.wav	This is the top view, complete circle visible	train

audio_0_233248.wav	So, physically separating the two	train
audio_0_29172.wav	So, Python provides us with a special value called None with the capital N, which is the special value used to define nothing an empty value or a null value	train
audio_0_29551.wav	But anyway it will never happened because then the whole drama of theatre of the world will stop	train
audio_0_97792.wav	Let us understand the example; I have a variable written in the global scope data	train
audio_0_1021.wav	And this side is the rotor side, this is reactance and this is your r 2 dash by S that your that because that your this part, this part is a variable part it depends on the slip right	train
audio_0_220892.wav	Conversely, node 1 in the tree points to vertexes, node 3 in the tree points to vertex, points to vertex 2, node 3 points to vertex 6, right	train
audio_0_74802.wav	So, this confirms that the area fluctuation is significantly higher on the rounded islands	train
audio_0_44981.wav	Now let us say we know the input output spec of the converter	train
audio_0_187774.wav	So, how do we penalize this	train

audio_0_176336.wav	Let us say you are given an article written in the newspaper and now you have to distinguish relevant parts or important parts from unimportant parts of the presented material	train
audio_0_214491.wav	you can see again, power, um becomes critical here, right	train
audio_0_230784.wav	So, this is gauge 1 this is gauge 2; slip gauge 1 slip gauge2	train
audio_0_157748.wav	So just like the same thing, when a transaction crashes, so again the log is searched, the log is searched, and everything for this Commit T is searched	train
audio_0_184763.wav	So, if this is the frequency, and no, this is frequency and this is time, this is time	train
audio_0_51059.wav	for example, when i consider the problem of displacement current in a capacitor in the previous lecture we said this change in electric field between the plates is giving rise to a magnetic field and we stop, did not even consider that that magnetic field which is changing gives rise to another field again	train
audio_0_31065.wav	That subscript to is	train
audio_0_92567.wav	So, for each x in [0, 1), we have this condition that the un is going to 0 as n approaches to infinity, but it does not converge uniformly to 0, this is what we will see now, that here, we have only pointwise convergence and we do not have uniform convergence	train
audio_0_93358.wav	you will find the problem arises especially in longer sentences, where you will find you are not able to trace the subject, and that is why when you put the verb which is at a later ah, which is in the later part of the sentence, ah, you have a lot of confusion	train
audio_0_145422.wav	And then continue operating and calls such as asynchronous I	train
audio_0_75263.wav	And for this purpose, what there was they tracked the FRET signal from the protruding side of the cell, from protruding adhesions and retracting adhesions	train
audio_0_203373.wav	Similarly, if we are going to draw it on top plane what we have to do is give a click that is right click on that Top Plane, then give a left click on that gives you top plane	train

audio_0_207154.wav	So, we show it by a kind of wavy kind of line	train
audio_0_193092.wav	But I am just going to give you a direct proof, so that it becomes more clear to you	train
audio_0_165589.wav	So therefore, the state variable model which we have just discussed is more general than the single input, single output model which we generally see in case of the transfer function	train
audio_0_216989.wav	we feed this input to a transformer, which is typically one, is to hundred and magnify the voltage, feed it to this l t c and then trigger, trigger, ah	train
audio_0_148358.wav	I already see a lot of people asking questions, and trying to answer	train
audio_0_222510.wav	Now, if anywhere if I create a tree, supposing I add an edge and supposing I take some i there and some j here, we may decide to add an edge	train

audio_0_124833.wav	its a result of voltage division between these two resistors	train
audio_0_102810.wav	And after this has being done then you can actually dereference p A and start using that objects	train
audio_0_197101.wav	It could be for instance from here to ground and it could be from here to ground or even elsewhere between the gate and drain for establishing bias	train
audio_0_85797.wav	So while the attacker keeps toggling between these 2 steps of flush and reload, we would see what happens as time progresses	train
audio_0_228983.wav	So, we have the value u bar here	train
audio_0_224154.wav	So, tasks 1 was the only prerequisite for 4, task 1 was the only prerequisite for 5 it has been completed	train
audio_0_106257.wav	Now this is more like, the patent office would like to know how other patent officers are dealing with the same application	train
audio_0_111025.wav	So, let us see what is the other point	train
audio_0_146205.wav	And therefore, if any of the resource that is used by a task is acquired, already acquired by another task, then that task would have higher priority and the current task could not be allowed to run	train
audio_0_225571.wav	So, we start with an empty tree, so again we will keep the tree as the list of edges and now we are going to scan this in order, 1 to m	train
audio_0_55474.wav	so we had seen that some of the timing constraints maybe corresponding to false path	train
audio_0_25289.wav	So he woke up at say 8 am for 8	train
audio_0_25734.wav	Now the reason for anti elimination is that, there could be several reasons, one is at a, this is the syn elimination and there is a front side attack that means the base is coming from the same side as a both the groups that the same side of the groups that are be eliminated	train
audio_0_34724.wav	2D divergence theorem exactly so, 2D divergence theorem right	train
audio_0_145225.wav	And then we were looking at what are the different types of real time systems, hard, soft form real time systems	train

audio_0_38890.wav	Not just that, I can also look at the direction of the gradients right	train
audio_0_62920.wav	the p type transistors are coming in series, right, so now the issue is that if you have a scenario where there are more complex ah gates you are trying to implement	train
audio_0_91812.wav	Well, so that is all for this lecture and I thank you for your attention	train
audio_0_21110.wav	I hope this would have been a good learning to you	train
audio_0_178189.wav	So, I have to have a lot of a gain stages to get the signal to the received level and the noise figure that I have is 10 dB	train
audio_0_224968.wav	If on the other hand, it is a leaf node it has no children, then what we do is we try to delete it by just setting the parents value to be nil	train
audio_0_221101.wav	Now, 10 to the 18 operations per seconds, since we can do only 10 to the 8 operations in 1 second, will take 10 to the 10 seconds	train
audio_0_115230.wav	they have intel linking between them also, right, so these are different aspects and the emphasis may vary based on type of application or type of requirement	train
audio_0_75330.wav	So, after you do this, after doing this you go ahead and do the next step after photomask you do again a develop, you do what is called a develop, where you put this in a development solution and then finally, you do a hard bake which is an optional step ok	train
audio_0_130675.wav	at t, less than two thousand k, the electrons combined with the ions to form neutral atoms and the electrical conductivity becomes very low	train

audio_0_55246.wav	when addition, you can use this as regions also because you can also make connections through this side	train
audio_0_19367.wav	So, that is how for making variety of decisions we need to consider the benefit which you have lost and that is called as an opportunity cost	train
audio_0_13649.wav	And it is written here e to the power j theta is equal to cos theta plus ah j sin theta, then one angle theta that is angle theta basically	train
audio_0_136165.wav	And the reason for this is because Raja Rao uses the perspective of this elderly village lady Achakka to subtly undercut the Gandhianism that Moorthy represents	train
audio_0_119739.wav	in other say, i can say any time, any place, connectivity for any one and anything so some, something like that	train
audio_0_220276.wav	Now, the claim is that if you look at this zone here which is plus minus d distance away from the separated line, then if I have some point outside this and if I want to look at any point across on the other side, this distance from here to here is key plus some distance on either side therefore, it is more than d	train
audio_0_192589.wav	So, a plus I comma b plus J must be an element in the image; that means, it must come from x, some x	train
audio_0_221229.wav	And what is the cost of that path, well, we inductively know that we have the cost of the best path from i to k using only 1 to k minus 1 inductive k minus 1, you also have the best path from k to j in our matrix W k minus 1	train
audio_0_200146.wav	So now you can see that minus v d equals v 0 minus ii times rm	train
audio_0_21658.wav	Now also get the total margin	train
audio_0_137333.wav	It is a result of many other factors for example it may be a result of temperature for example if you take that if you take the weighing, weight measurement case then the then the strain gauge resistance change, is not only a function of the weight you put it is also a function of the temperature because every resistance has some temperature coefficient	train
audio_0_147088.wav	The nodes tab will list the information about the nodes and the edges tab will list the source target information as we stored it in the gml file	train

audio_0_56838.wav	so this sealing of this number two point something will be three	train
audio_0_70271.wav	But then there will be plan deviations and monitor if there are deviations and then take corrective actions so that any changes to the plan is contained and also it may be necessary to change the plan continuously because when we plan initially we cannot foresee many things and therefore the plan needs to be changed as the project progresses	train
audio_0_25979.wav	So, you must take appropriate action to make sure that the interaction goes in the direction that you expect	train
audio_0_49731.wav	i'll take this off and take it from behind and see what the reading would be	train
audio_0_150235.wav	Run this code again and you see the most commonly appearing trigrams	train

audio_0_203845.wav	Now, parallel to that select this one mirror, mirror about this line, apply	train
audio_0_179432.wav	So, now, we let us go little bit deeper just to sort of quickly run through, the 3 cases are when I know only the PDF, then the when the channel receiver knows the channel state information, and the way we would achieve a capacity in this case is to have very long code words	train
audio_0_227296.wav	And if it is this surface, or which is the reference surface based on which it is it is calibrated, it has to be always used based on the surface and often	train
audio_0_117326.wav	and this migration module, ah, no, keep a track that which are the providers there, what are their loading capacity and type of things, and based on those it goes on a which need to be, which providers need to be selected	train
audio_0_174061.wav	The learner likes to work on such a thing	train
audio_0_116113.wav	but we will try to look at ah the different aspects of mobile cloud computing	train

audio_0_152563.wav	He also became conscious of these micro expressions and he coined the term	train
audio_0_105145.wav	Again consider the complex class and we know for example if I write in parallely in case of say a double type, then if I have a variable of type double then I can input from c in I can output to c out using these operators	train
audio_0_58829.wav	you must also look into that, whether it is driving a high capacitive load or it is not driving that higher load	train
audio_0_74567.wav	So, this also brings us one point that there are different mechano responsive elements within the cell and there are diverse timescale associated with each of them	train
audio_0_225015.wav	So, we need to pick those jobs perhaps whose time is closest to the deadline	train
audio_0_60419.wav	so this is one design philosophy you can adopt where, looking at the signal activity of the input, you can push the highest activity node to the lowest input, like here: a, b, c, d will be a better input assignment rather than d, c, b, a	train
audio_0_130210.wav	the season, the hindenburg approaches	train

audio_0_191491.wav	That is the last thing is nothing but saying that F alpha is 0, because kernel phi that we have phi that we have earlier kernel phi is the set of all idea all polynomials that have alpha is a root	train
audio_0_187773.wav	So that your over fitting effects can be reduced	train
audio_0_65800.wav	Well I mean it has it is advantage and disadvantage because the disadvantage is that then you need another additional kind of enclosure, which is much more exposed and the disadvantage is that you do not have to do this stuff inside the outer facility of your lab	train
audio_0_42942.wav	And, what about the imaginary part	train
audio_0_12750.wav	So, this is actually this one if you simplify, it is dv by dt plus v upon R c is equal to V s upon R C U t	train
audio_0_139343.wav	So this says that, so basically if you do not do that, what there is, then something happens called aliasing, aliasing means that one frequency signal will appear from the samples to be of completely a different frequency, it will appear as a different lower frequency signal, so you are going to get a lot of low frequency error which is, which is bad generally	train
audio_0_81163.wav	Then I see that the input offset current for typical 741 is 200 nano ampere maximum as the matching between into input terminals is improved the difference between Ib1 and Ib2 become smaller that is the input offset current value decreases further right	train
audio_0_51191.wav	what does that momentum do	train
audio_0_142868.wav	But what portfolio they have, your company has, you can see from 1B	train
audio_0_57238.wav	lets say the inputs are changing all of them from zero to one	train
audio_0_152143.wav	Meaning, the concepts like k anonymity came in 15 or 20 years before, but certain many further and advance techniques that have been developed to identify users, to identify faces, to identify information about users, to re identify people on social network, people on other networks	train
audio_0_47369.wav	Now i is equal to 0 implies r s tending to the finite value	train
audio_0_143838.wav	It was pretty high 1	train
audio_0_232487.wav	Just like the truck driver, normal human beings also believe and behave in such a manner as if whatever space around them is for them to utilize and it is meant for them to enjoy	train
audio_0_77877.wav	So, migration is driven by actin polymerization	train
audio_0_220382.wav	So, under the condition that no two the edges at the same weight, the minimum separator lemma says that whenever you separate V in to do parts which are not empty, then the smallest edge connecting these two parts must lie in every spanning tree, every minimum cost spanning tree	train
audio_0_183902.wav	So, happens that my data comes with the delay of 1, I am going to see very high correlation with some other users did	train
audio_0_186283.wav	The gg plot two provides a very beautiful package for generating graphics in R in this course, we have not deal much with g g plot	train
audio_0_208072.wav	Similarly, we will be in a position to construct a line which pass through P 3	train
audio_0_56095.wav	now, usually this routing is carried out on the metal layers in silicon	train
audio_0_148542.wav	It is about actually can I collect some information about you from your social network behavior and use it against you, how easily or effectively can phisher use this information	train
audio_0_57073.wav	ok, this is one factor, cost, and the second one, which we call as radius: what is radius	train
audio_0_226349.wav	So, that as and when you move you see the micro so, what they are trying to say is, you have a table	train
audio_0_221544.wav	Because I can only allow, so I totally have n vertices, so if I do not allow any vertex to repeat anywhere along the way then; obviously, I can only have n minus 1 vertices, n minus 1 edges	train
audio_0_79543.wav	This whole setup is mounted on an inverted microscope	train
audio_0_81053.wav	Then we go further common mode rejection ratio some of the parameter you will immediately recall, because we have already discussed common mode rejection ratio	train
audio_0_16811.wav	So, the this means these two in for these to a parallel circuits	train
audio_0_203126.wav	The engineering way is very complicated drawings involved, and we need to understand what exactly each component is performing and doing, and what are the dimensions of that and how does that cut sectional looks like	train
audio_0_230343.wav	Sine bar is advantage is very precise and accurate	train
audio_0_18884.wav	So, this we have studied much ah studied before	train
audio_0_174367.wav	PO8 can be, this particular PO can be addressed through a dedicated course on professional ethics	train
audio_0_145053.wav	Current tax	train
audio_0_181112.wav	So, basically you are interested in all other base stations and their distances from your mobile	train
audio_0_202621.wav	1 it will be somewhere here around	train
audio_0_168104.wav	So today we will discuss the concept of root mean square voltage and current which is also called as effective voltage or current	train
audio_0_219881.wav	Now, we know that each box of barfis earns a profit of 100 rupees and each box of halwa earns a profit of 600 rupees	train
audio_0_217363.wav	communication communication link ah is essentially a bluetooth low energy link	train
audio_0_19373.wav	So, for 100 units if cost is 1000 rupees, if you make 101 unit and the cost is 1,000 5, then for one unit the extra cost is 5 rupees, that is a marginal cost of one unit	train
audio_0_55288.wav	but if you do not, if you do not consider this first, if you are consider this one initially, so in the middle, you really do not know the exact position of these signal	train
audio_0_230686.wav	Grade 00 is kept in the standards room and is used for inspection and calibration of high precision only	train
audio_0_18267.wav	This 20 and 40 they are in parallel right	train
audio_0_189731.wav	For example if you want to select a part of matrix which has sub matrix you can use this colon operator ok	train
audio_0_64900.wav	there can be some permanent deformation now which we say is beyond the limit of elasticity, which means if you release it, the body m two will not come back exactly to its original position	train
audio_0_10416.wav	368 V 0 right	train
audio_0_76839.wav	So, in what does this mean that each patient can generate his/her own pluripotent stem cell line and this is what is the beauty of personalized medicine	train
audio_0_223768.wav	So, this says that we can take this fairly complicated looking question about production with the demand and hiring and inspiring and productivity and all that and set it out with some 72 plus 274 variables and a complex cost function and feed it to simplex and get an answer	train
audio_0_220836.wav	So, the bottlenecks were really at this part of the loop	train
audio_0_159736.wav	It should not, it cannot be reversed	train
audio_0_172771.wav	They have to be designed accordingly	train
audio_0_204307.wav	We will insert components	train
audio_0_133727.wav	Now stimulus is basically any event, any situation, any condition, any signal, and any cue that triggers you to give a response that is the stimulus	train
audio_0_50714.wav	so it carries a current i, i and has n turns, so that the number of turns per unit length is n over l	train
audio_0_208552.wav	So, we have already located point V on that curve	train
audio_0_208889.wav	Construct parallel lines which are passing through these points	train
audio_0_216297.wav	as a first step, one of the things is this: is if you, if the phone moves like this, the x axis moves, you will get data on the x axis	train
audio_0_67162.wav	So, this is your week 7 lecture 1	train
audio_0_53141.wav	this is a sheet	train
audio_0_234889.wav	So, it is a chain reaction	train
audio_0_222046.wav	So, this is a forward partitioning algorithm which keeps reducing the length of the un partition part, if I see something which is upper, I just move the green pointer	train
audio_0_77189.wav	What has been observed is when you perturbed cells with contractility inhibitors	train
audio_0_40969.wav	So, let us just start with the idea of waves that are bending right	train
audio_0_221542.wav	And if I look at the cost of direct path from s to t, it cannot be any bigger than this one, because at best this loop has 0 and decrease nothing but, in the general case the loop has some positive cost and actually reduce the cost	train
audio_0_159161.wav	However, project name has a problem	train
audio_0_119390.wav	another important aspects is cloudonomics, or economy of using cloud computing	train
audio_0_72001.wav	The other important concept that we will discuss in this lecture is the project scope	train
audio_0_40636.wav	So, do not mix up total and scattered field here with the incident and reflected, this is not a physical reflection, I am not put a material over there right, this is a numerical reflection ok	train
audio_0_186011.wav	And as we mentioned before we thought the constraint that would have been 2 variables and you would have got 2 equations which would have been grad f equal to 0	train
audio_0_107093.wav	So, teaching had a function that was directed towards the good of the public	train
audio_0_98382.wav	Polymorphism means, poly means many and morph means to change	train
audio_0_230559.wav	This in turn can correlate the pressure and temperature of the gas, ok	train
audio_0_190249.wav	So, first I want to divide 3 x 4 by x squared, how do you do that	train
audio_0_129143.wav	four goes this, ten goes that way, and out of that, three goes this way and seven goes that way	train
audio_0_182754.wav	Again we also made an observation if there is no time dispersion, tau d is 0, so which means your coherence band width is infinity, so that means, you know frequency hopping will not help even if you change your carrier frequency you are going to see the same channel	train
audio_0_39429.wav	So, let us observe that what we did is by using only at 2 point Gauss quadrature rule, I was able to get the exact answer 4 right	train
audio_0_134477.wav	This type of a technique is basically based on the natural occurrence of relationship between two or more variables	train
audio_0_59735.wav	so a more realistic ah, you can say, means analysis of the delays should consider the different signal transition separately, because the way gates are designed, gates are modeled, those delays can also be different, right	train
audio_0_192344.wav	So, if n is positive, then the number of elements is exactly n that is because we know this already because Z mod n Z is a group of order n right	train
audio_0_184155.wav	So, whenever if I were to write it in dB E b by N naught in d B, is P s by P n in dB minus 3 dB that is it	train
audio_0_53855.wav	and then if once i calculate at x, since everything is spherically symmetric everywhere around at the same distance, the potential would be the same	train
audio_0_42928.wav	Frequency terms are the phasor terms are 0 right	train
audio_0_209625.wav	Similar thing happens even for cycle, you prepare something like a seat, chain, sprocket, wheel, tire, individual parts you carefully prepare it, save them, then load them, assemble them and visualize the objects	train
audio_0_12982.wav	So, R plus R L R plus R L will be cancelled both sides	train
audio_0_239865.wav	So, you do not really need to spend too much time	train
audio_0_205634.wav	Similarly in the perceptive projections, these are based on point; we look through certain point and what kind of views we will see	train
audio_0_96707.wav	If you look closely further you will realize that we are able to do this because I have defined the stack variables that data members as public	train
audio_0_24310.wav	To answer this question Sir I would like to say this for a school going student writing is the most important activity which helps them learn in efficiently that is what we have identified, seeing experience throughout our school days and college days, so more writing enhances our memory is one what we have been learning through all our school days, then it helps us understand concepts better and practicing graphical representations and diagrams helps us remember those diagrams better for a longer time	train
audio_0_233587.wav	They are given additional knowledge	train
audio_0_185072.wav	Now, of course, you may want to say that well you know what take away power from the good channel give it to the bad channel the that you know you may want you may want to do a little bit of that	train
audio_0_168277.wav	Current would be essentially the value of I 1 because this is the current which is flowing from this particular site	train
audio_0_7910.wav	So, voltage source is shorted here we have shorted only current, when 4 ampere current source is only there at that time this is the current i x dash right	train
audio_0_14750.wav	And as this is actually common terminal so right	train
audio_0_148247.wav	You get the same response when you open Google in your browser; but, the browser is capable of understanding this HTML code, and showing it as a pretty looking web page that you see, OK	train
audio_0_159327.wav	So suppose S is the following	train
audio_0_26485.wav	If you find that we have reached an empty node then we do the equivalent of creating a new node here we set this value to be v and we create a new frontier below by adding two empty nodes in the left and right rather than just having none	train
audio_0_105306.wav	Then I have a constructor which does a job of the initialization and it takes this name and type and sets it in this two variables	train
audio_0_142571.wav	Companies policies and code of conduct were in place which was supposed to regulate both the board and management but proper guidance was not there	train
audio_0_214855.wav	the advantage is you just advertise	train
audio_0_150377.wav	All of this information can be used to actually decide on presenting the search results	train
audio_0_117793.wav	so we basically have what we had is a basic, very basic, introductory things, or xml	train
audio_0_210538.wav	So, let us pick a right plane, normal to that right plane	train
audio_0_46484.wav	We now have to do one important activity which is designing the components	train
audio_0_175100.wav	So this is something those of you interested in this dimension you can look at the famous book on emotional intelligence	train
audio_0_66701.wav	So, at this stage what is important the take home message for you people is, yes, we have these different kinds of vessels where I started with	train
audio_0_190810.wav	So, a plus b is in I m, but I m is contained in I because I m is one of the factors whose union is I	train
audio_0_210483.wav	For example, here we have already have constructed a tangent line passing through point P	train
audio_0_102599.wav	And what I find is a good tendency that the programmers have is actually use the C++ compiler, but write code in C	train
audio_0_56955.wav	so again here, the average number of cells you will be leveling will is expected to be matchless, as compared to the case where you start the wavefront propagation from one point	train
audio_0_134612.wav	You also have rich qualitative data which has very high ecological validity	train
audio_0_221140.wav	So, we have the starting position and then given i, we can compute directly in one shot just doing arithmetic with respect to the starting address, the position of A i	train
audio_0_237888.wav	Employers accord, again, you know, these are western, or US based mandates	train
audio_0_179496.wav	We will design the different encoders we will take the channel conditions we will quantize them in to different SNRs	train
audio_0_83111.wav	So, if you see the slide, you see that noise is purely random signal, the instantaneous value or a phase of waveform cannot be predicted at any time	train
audio_0_193834.wav	So, second property says that remember, what is the second statement that S mod R mod kernel phi	train
audio_0_48684.wav	the net result is that we get b zero vector is equal to i cross e zero times k over omega	train
audio_0_23722.wav	I click pictures of the PPT and yeah… Click pictures of the… PPTs	train
audio_0_131106.wav	all right, so now, so far, if you ah remember, we have already been exposed to one form of sensible energy storage and that is regenerative heat exchangers	train
audio_0_184940.wav	Now, the reason this the bad channel did not dominate or did not cause a significant degradation was because the probability is less it is only 10 percent of the time	train
audio_0_135332.wav	20 to 60 minutes you have a 40 minutes gap, but then the information lost is very little, just 6 percent more,3 percent in 9 hours and 10 percent when you cover one full day 24 hours	train
audio_0_42990.wav	So, this is this is what we do now so, far I have not told you anything about what this s 2 should be ok	train
audio_0_34940.wav	The Poynting actual Poynting vector will be conserved regardless of what you choose to integrate ok	train
audio_0_129514.wav	ok, so that also tells you that these parameters will be infinitely	train
audio_0_189579.wav	What we have seen in the melt, we have to specify what are the Id variables and the measurement variables	train
audio_0_221454.wav	We can go to the right or we can go up because these two dependencies are now removed	train
audio_0_228660.wav	4; which is equal to 0	train
audio_0_236053.wav	Why because, a lot of people are counting on them, to do, what they are there for	train
audio_0_21896.wav	that is an indication of your resilience to perform under pressure	train
audio_0_50927.wav	so i get four pi rho zero, square over epsilon, zero, integral zero to infinity	train
audio_0_100739.wav	Certainly, let me also mentioned another point let say suppose this was there and let say in a function g instead of this you have just written g	train
audio_0_39350.wav	And, what is happening is being multiplied by P N x and integrated, but how did we construct these P N's	train
audio_0_207294.wav	This one supposed to be something like 40 units you would like to have mm click ok	train
audio_0_72310.wav	The technology is not certain and so on	train
audio_0_25739.wav	So that may this favor this front side attack or the syn elimination	train
audio_0_70180.wav	So, try to by models which are very simple and which are kind of if you can get them made locally where very fortunate	train
audio_0_82121.wav	So, the point is that that is also another topic that which one is better 110 is better 230 volts is better, but if you if you take a example of a electronic equipment at our home, for example, juicer or a trimmer, it can operate on both the voltages	train
audio_0_41703.wav	So, if you approximate it by a larger series you will get more and more terms right	train
audio_0_237984.wav	If you have, any questions, or doubts, or any ideas, on how, you can discuss these issues, in greater detail, in your classrooms, or among your peers	train
audio_0_101588.wav	So, what is interesting to note that when you construct like this our basic principle of single inheritance tell us that there will have to be two person objects in the same TA object	train
audio_0_150192.wav	Now, NLTK provides stop words for the English language which we can use to identify these words and eliminate them from our analysis	train
audio_0_201713.wav	So, wherever holes are located, we just show by dash lines	train
audio_0_34704.wav	So, let us write this out I just write this on the top over here T m remember epsilon r is a function of space otherwise the problem is not interesting ok	train
audio_0_210420.wav	Now, the first step is from C all the way to K; we have to construct a vertical line	train
audio_0_150986.wav	Given to, so this is more scientific way of asking the question, given to user profiles and the respective user username says each composed of past and current user names find if profiles refer to the same individual	train
audio_0_142146.wav	I have already told you to select one company and read the annual report of that company	train
audio_0_23675.wav	But sometimes like in nowadays, but in earlier days I used to write in mobile phones	train
audio_0_132511.wav	ok, at the evaporator end, what comes out is even chilled water, but that chilled water has a, so has some applications, ah, which can be, and and it can be used for that	train
audio_0_219139.wav	So, now, we are made up first entry in the table itself, Fibonacci of 1 is 1, then we look at Fibonacci of 0 and again, it is a new value, we got it from the base case, but we have never computed before	train
audio_0_66288.wav	we you are doing at a micron level and these are still	train
audio_0_27189.wav	When we are reading a file incrementally, it is useful to know when the file is over because we may not know in advance how long files is or how many lines of file is	train
audio_0_148149.wav	If they were more they would have shown up in this next page	train
audio_0_235199.wav	Pay and, benefits policies	train
audio_0_203694.wav	We are at Lecture number 40	train
audio_0_211521.wav	i have just taken ten percent and i give you those numbers with respect to ten percentage, quite like that in the teg world	train
audio_0_91347.wav	So, L 2 is equal to T 2 by L 1 square T 2 ah T 2 by T 1 ah is square into L 1 because if I just take this thing towards that	train
audio_0_96834.wav	And with this parameter, malloc will dynamically allocate the appropriate number of bytes as I consecutive junk they all will be together as a consecutive junk on the heap	train
audio_0_27700.wav	So, we have a value which is missing at the top and we have a value at the bottom namely 11 whose node is going to be deleted	train
audio_0_82787.wav	Now we will apply low frequency, and we keep on increasing to the high frequency	train
audio_0_188625.wav	So, after I remove the 34th point my R squared slightly increases; that is also from the 3rd decimal place	train
audio_0_222681.wav	So, here we can probe this entry A i j in unit time, whereas we need time proportional to the number of neighbors of i, to find out whether j is a neighbor of i in an adjacency list	train
audio_0_203389.wav	Once it is done click the tick mark	train
audio_0_24512.wav	Any other is that you can think off that we can use this as a platform	train
audio_0_31475.wav	They have different propagation constants in different directions even though	train
audio_0_220910.wav	So, exactly the same idea of using a min heap with updates we will use	train
audio_0_191505.wav	So, let us take for example, R over Q and let us take root 2 plus root 3, technically speaking we do not even know if it is algebraic or not yet	train
audio_0_200487.wav	05 volt inverse times 3	train
audio_0_20062.wav	Fix will be simple, it will directly be only coming once that is by 1	train
audio_0_196731.wav	Now if this condition is satisfied under some circumstances it is possible for this signal VDS across the drain source voltage to be substantially more than the output voltage V0	train
audio_0_99416.wav	Similarly, if I have A as a friend of B, B is a friend of C from within these classes that does not imply that A is a friend of C, so the transitivity does not work	train
audio_0_147775.wav	This will generate a screen shot in png format, and you can save it anywhere you want	train
audio_0_48159.wav	but we just seen the previous point that e zero inside the gravity and therefore they cannot be a distribution of charge	train
audio_0_49499.wav	that's one equation, and the other equation is partial b z over partial x is equal to minus mu, zero, epsilon zero, partial e, y, partial t	train
audio_0_101955.wav	But, if you look into the destruction, the d is destructed first and c is destructed next	train
audio_0_92284.wav	So 3 x square minus 4 x and then dy is written as 2 x, dx	train
audio_0_168903.wav	So, you can simply say that these 3 functions are either the derivative or integration of the functions which we discussed	train
audio_0_204474.wav	In this oblong method, we basically construct a rectangle based on the major axis 100 mm	train
audio_0_64624.wav	there will be a change, so i can detect it right	train
audio_0_28.wav	So, obviously, if you introduce tight tolerances regime, there would be an overall quality improvement because in the process selection will also have to be done in a manners so that tight tolerances of the particular specification has to meet at the process level	train
audio_0_71550.wav	We have to consider each and every possible type of cost, each and every type of benefit during the CB analysis because we have seen that very upon the management, they are not considering, they are not taking into account the intangible benefits and intangible what cost because they are difficult to measure, the difficult to identifiable, the difficult to quantifiable	train
audio_0_8598.wav	so R 1 1 0	train
audio_0_182403.wav	The combination of the 2 give you the symbol waveform and then that is a ok	train
audio_0_3937.wav	So, now question is that for	train
audio_0_6313.wav	So, if you put this expression of i here expression of i here in terms of 1 minus 3 0 by 3 then solve it you will get i 0	train
audio_0_231308.wav	Apart from this, I suggested some more tips such as I said that you give due regard to your deadlines	train
audio_0_45926.wav	But this trick would be very useful when you want to do repeated simulation of the circuit for changes other than the state values and you can quickly see the output results in this fashion	train
audio_0_220098.wav	These are partitions	train
audio_0_8103.wav	So, basically if these nodes are common this 2 are it is a common node, similarly these is common node little bit you have to first understand looking at the circuit and the you can solve it because no electrical element is involve between in this wire and here also right	train
audio_0_153580.wav	We can make out in the left hand side photographs whether the space has been used to intimidate another person	train
audio_0_50168.wav	like this, therefore, i should be going down in the rod and therefore in the loop it should be going like this	train
audio_0_38603.wav	So, the first case, what will I write	train
audio_0_226584.wav	So, these are silly examples but the thing is that the minimum and the maximum numbers are known there	train
audio_0_4582.wav	We call R input is equal to R Thevenin right	train
audio_0_225333.wav	So, we can keep the order one of course, for union, but order log n can actually be reduced	train
audio_0_13490.wav	So, it is written I m sin 2 pi f t	train
audio_0_223806.wav	If somebody asks us for a factorial of minus 7, we will just return 1	train
audio_0_92540.wav	We will be talking about it later, we will study two more types of convergence, because here, we are letting only that this difference under this integral goes to 0	train
audio_0_45660.wav	So we could have a BJT something like this, PNP based	train
audio_0_110276.wav	So, this chart is smith chart you see that all constant resistance circles they are this and this outer boundary that is corresponding to the R bar is equal to 0 circle, if center is at 0 0 and its radius is 1 that means, from the center to the right most point this is considered as 1	train

audio_0_171767.wav	So first we will take that lets see that the t is ranging between zero to one, when t ranges between zero to one the maximum value of t will be one in this case so when you have one coming at this point it means that there will be no overlap between these two functions so what we can say, we say the convolution of x one and x t two for time t between zero to one is zero	train
audio_0_225788.wav	So, it refers to the fact that these correspond to problems where you can non deterministically guess the solution, you can magically produce the solution and then in polynomial time, you can verify whether the solution is correct or not	train
audio_0_82468.wav	So, this main set, this particular value is constant; 2 is constant, I DS by V p whole square will be constant, V G S minus V p, V p is again constant	train
audio_0_154493.wav	Welcome dear participants, in the prior modules we have looked at the interpretations of our hands and fingers	train

audio_0_195665.wav	Now it also depends on the technology itself	train
audio_0_213796.wav	um, ok, another thing is antenna	train
audio_0_226698.wav	So, there is a backlash error or there can be deflection which is there	train
audio_0_49473.wav	therefore the horizontal lines in this do not contribute to the line integral	train
audio_0_143793.wav	So you can see that in March 16, they were, sorry, in March 16 they were able to significantly increase their gross profit margin	train
audio_0_224173.wav	So, we will have these entries and we want to scan all of these and then add up all the 1s	train
audio_0_36316.wav	Then around the 1960s is where the field of computational Electromagnetics get started, because now people get ambitious computers are there	train
audio_0_31595.wav	So, even though I have written just r, it is understood that when you see r it is actually r with vector on top, but it makes the whole thing very clumsy	train
audio_0_215563.wav	it is the gain of the omni directional antenna	train
audio_0_92240.wav	The y varies from this 0 to b in this case	train
audio_0_180.wav	So, therefore on a subgroup basis or on a certain frequency basis, if we could have a sample to probably which could be 1% of the whole production large, and if the sub grouping and the timing of the subgroup selection is then in appropriate manner, this 1% to be able to give you a fair estimate of the whole population	train
audio_0_83064.wav	Once you perform the experiment by yourself, you will have more idea, or more questions, or more difficulties that you can ask to me, or try to solve by yourself, right	train
audio_0_18757.wav	This switch is closed right	train
audio_0_229854.wav	So, we have, this is the reference signal input and then we have a control algorithm, then we have an actuator, then we have a plant and that will give output, right	train
audio_0_208655.wav	So, V is one end of this ellipse V prime is another end of an ellipse	train
audio_0_164808.wav	You will have the equation as we discuseds in the case	train
audio_0_195554.wav	Now, of course, I don't need to make this any more mysterious than it is	train
audio_0_185037.wav	So, again is the problem statement clear I have transmitter, I have receiver, I want to maximize the notion of capacity, now in the in the absence of knowledge of instantaneous SNR it is a very difficult problem not going to spend too much time on that	train
audio_0_115154.wav	so advantage is already we have already ah discussed ah	train
audio_0_56295.wav	this shows the different timing that i have just introduced: d flip flop	train
audio_0_163690.wav	Now I can write it in terms of Cartesian coordinate what is it	train
audio_0_240095.wav	The first step here is needs analysis	train
audio_0_149122.wav	Users of less in degree do not reciprocate to spammers; whereas, users with larger in degree which is larger number of followers tend to follow back more	train
audio_0_180312.wav	So, we did spend some amount of time understanding the statistical characterization of the other types of fading	train
audio_0_192343.wav	So, more generally for every positive integer, let us say for every non negative integer Z mod n Z, there is absolutely no difference it is exactly the same calculation and if you replace 3 by n you get that Z mod n Z is a ring	train
audio_0_51358.wav	what if, instead of taking air and glass interface, if i took water glass interface	train
audio_0_44902.wav	So in the A block library you see add	train
audio_0_39049.wav	So, there are no fields that are varying in time and what I have done is I have connected this whole thing to a constant voltage	train
audio_0_103553.wav	Whereas, if I talk about this other member which is public, I can I writing d dot data 2B, I can also access, that we will discuss about this access issues later on, but I just wanted to highlight this on the passing	train
audio_0_39675.wav	Then the final example I want to show you is modes of ring resonator ok	train
audio_0_216332.wav	ok, weinberg considered the stride length as a function of the difference of maximum and minimum vertical acceleration, of the vertical displacement peaks, of essentially nothing but the peaks of vertical acceleration of the hip during one step	train
audio_0_179492.wav	So, you are maximizing capacity, under all possible options for P gamma	train
audio_0_149539.wav	Next is defining the set of options for the chart	train
audio_0_7991.wav	So, this way so, what you can do is first you apply your KVL like this	train
audio_0_207345.wav	So, now, entire drawing you has been lost	train
audio_0_179589.wav	So, that is what we are going to be doing	train
audio_0_165580.wav	So, what you will write for this	train
audio_0_79223.wav	So, you have these proteins which kind of bind interact, bind and interact with each other	train
audio_0_102781.wav	The next is what is known as reinterpret cast operator, the third kind of	train
audio_0_93448.wav	for example, if i say i am teaching well now, here the auxiliary is m, but when i have to use tag, the rule says i have to use arent i	train
audio_0_44383.wav	So, that was the general setup	train
audio_0_32363.wav	Which whole equation	train
audio_0_81609.wav	So now, he has given the input to the inverting terminal of the operational amplifier, right	train
audio_0_235142.wav	Then, how do you coordinate, media relations	train
audio_0_75273.wav	So, this is a make major difference in the 2 separate portions of the cell	train
audio_0_211166.wav	ok, but then lot of paraphernalia circuit and lot of ah adjustments have to be done to get the thermoelectric generator to actually work and give you something useful	train
audio_0_139112.wav	For example, there can be very often, there can be actuated saturation, that is the characteristic of the, this is the control input CI and this is the plant input PI, so this is the actuator characteristic, so as you increase the control input the actuator will also proportionally include the plant input but only up to a certain point, after which it will saturate, so if you give more and more control input it will not give you proportionally high plant input	train
audio_0_49853.wav	what that means is if i have a charge distribution, i can think of this charge distribution as if there is a charge somewhere in this volume shown by red	train
audio_0_207361.wav	Right now my hands are not touching mouse, but I have already clicked that circle icon, so still it is maintaining on that monitor	train
audio_0_187786.wav	And one general rule is regularization helps the model work better with test data because you avoid over fitting on the train data	train
audio_0_132674.wav	utilities like hot air, hot oil, steam can be used for heating this stream, and utilities like air at normal temperature, ah, ambient air, water, chilled water, refrigerant that can be used for cooling this stream or going to a low target temperature	train
audio_0_146587.wav	The simplest of these protocols is called as the Basic Priority Inheritance Protocol	train
audio_0_151219.wav	I am sure as we move along; you will actually understand why Twitter is actually high in terms of finding out the home location	train
audio_0_192993.wav	So, I am simply taking phi of 1 to be a; so, let us take a to be 1	train
audio_0_31384.wav	Did we deal with time at all	train
audio_0_54002.wav	this is the force due to this ring that i took of radius r	train
audio_0_197826.wav	By changing VGS we can change the conductance between drain and source	train
audio_0_195922.wav	Now what happens if VS increases, this ID here will actually reduce because the gate source voltage reduces	train
audio_0_145977.wav	So, as far as the cyclic schedulers are concerned, one important question to answer is that how to fix the frame duration and how to assign tasks to the frames	train
audio_0_205014.wav	If two dimensional objects are present how to visualize these views	train
audio_0_69785.wav	Now, the modification what has been made in this medium is pretty much all the components remain the same except it is osmolarity has been varied	train
audio_0_228403.wav	So, this is how our software and this co ordinate measuring machine works, you can see the points are generated being generated here	train
audio_0_149136.wav	So, it just basically shows you what kind of users of the top five link farmers which is creating these links to others and then getting others to follow you back	train
audio_0_92431.wav	And very interesting property now we will look into for trigonometric system	train
audio_0_84141.wav	So now what we have seen, we have seen an active band pass filter and we have seen a passive band pass filter as an experiment	train
audio_0_186741.wav	So, what do we mean by this	train
audio_0_214257.wav	i would say high level data handling	train
audio_0_217938.wav	so it generalize and its say: client clean session is an interesting option	train
audio_0_28099.wav	So the moral of the story is that when you have a programming task, you know what you want to do, look around for the language that suites your task the best	train
audio_0_180484.wav	Each of them has got a variance of one half	train
audio_0_178900.wav	So, basically transited data rate is constant, is constant and the reason because of that is because the transmitter does not know what the current channel conditions are, is constant regardless of the instantaneous value of gamma n, regardless of gamma n	train
audio_0_207444.wav	So, done, then press escape	train
audio_0_59792.wav	this is actually true, just to tell you, for the circuits	train
audio_0_29638.wav	So, said who will take care after us and that all parents think autistic child	train
audio_0_220336.wav	So, G is not already connected, then there is no way we can actually connect using a subset of edges	train
audio_0_139915.wav	You know, as things move some small particles may be generated by friction, similarly small, similarly sometimes air may come into the fluid, so all these entrapped air, dust particles, these things have to be removed from the system and the fluid as it flows it also cleanses this and brings it to the filter, where they are filtered	train
audio_0_3229.wav	Voltage connected to a delta connected balanced load that is 8 plus j 4 ohm right per phase	train
audio_0_28928.wav	So, if we print the name colours, we just get the list black, red and green	train
audio_0_66131.wav	So, we talked about oxygen and carbon dioxide we talked about extra cellular matrix, we talked about the cell cycle dedifferentiation de adaptation and of course, we talked about the cell lines and in between we have talked about little bit very little bit about primary culture and now we talked about then we talked about the PH acetic or basic PH where the most of the cell groups at 7; PH 7 and then we talked about medium growth factors hormones and the need for energy molecules or source of carbons source of carbon	train
audio_0_225611.wav	So, this current edge we are called e j, so if you look at all the edges e 1 to e j minus 1 none of them connected U to V or the component connecting U	train
audio_0_162027.wav	Now, first let us look at a line array with 2 N plus 1 elements	train
audio_0_151507.wav	Here is a table which actually connects to the topics that I said earlier which is negative effect, anxiety, anger and arousal	train
audio_0_82968.wav	Safety first	train
audio_0_545.wav	Therefore we can write T 1 upon T 2 is equal to phi 1 I a one the first case divided by phi 2 I a I a 2 second case, but flux remain constant for shunt motor therefore, phi 1 is equal to phi 2, here it is in phi 1 is equal to phi 2 that mean it will be I a 1 upon I 2	train
audio_0_24079.wav	We have 2200 years ago evidence that somebody else had already come up with and this actually works	train
audio_0_194776.wav	I apply a test voltage, V test, evaluate the current that is flowing there, which I'll call I test, and V test by I test gives me the resistance	train
audio_0_173653.wav	Continuous improvement in the quality of learning is what characterize is the essence of present NBA accreditation	train
audio_0_193541.wav	Once I show this, it will follow that in this ring we have an element which is not prime, but it is irreducible	train
audio_0_130166.wav	ok, so these are some of the methods that are being thought of compressed gas storage in underground tanks	train
audio_0_27975.wav	So there is a dynamic part also, but it is exclusively for this kind of user defined data types and the static part takes care of all the standard data types that you use for counting and various standard things and particular arrays very often	train
audio_0_234926.wav	And, they will not fall sick	train
audio_0_211894.wav	let us stay	train
audio_0_166315.wav	First order differential equations are used in analytical studies of the control system	train
audio_0_91381.wav	That is when you are basically adding therefore, a because this normally the water moves in this direction	train
audio_0_218004.wav	now lets move to the other screen, the, the publishers screen	train
audio_0_64357.wav	it can be a binary tree, it can be a tree of higher dimension	train
audio_0_145581.wav	So even if a task set misses or doesn't meet the Leland criterion, still it may be possible to feasibly schedule it	train
audio_0_84918.wav	So, this is how we have to understand	train
audio_0_141811.wav	You can see almost 19 plus 402 more or less you are going to get this amount	train
audio_0_218919.wav	The actual search space is exponential, if we are looking for shortest paths, there are an exponential number of paths, if we are looking for a minimum cost spanning tree, there are an exponential number of such spanning trees to search through	train
audio_0_42427.wav	So, you can if I tell you that the PML is a special kind of absorbing material you can see the motivation, we have already come across just by simple common sense we have come up with one kind of absorber in which where the loss increases gradually right	train
audio_0_8179.wav	So, equivalent circuit is shown	train
audio_0_222307.wav	So, a i j is 1, there is an edge, a i j is 0, if there is no edge	train
audio_0_15092.wav	So, in that case we are adding 1 resistance R right	train
audio_0_190103.wav	So, each monomial has a degree to it and we add coefficient of monomials of same degree	train
audio_0_172746.wav	To what extent, it is based on the performance in these assessment instruments	train
audio_0_84513.wav	Then the input offset current	train
audio_0_17107.wav	So, R 2 dash for the referred to the your what you call primary side R 2 dash will be K square R 2 that is 4 ohm, right all data you put, right and X 2 dash will be K square X 2	train
audio_0_103177.wav	It also has a message to say that it has happened	train
audio_0_95532.wav	as i said, we do not get assignments, projects in isolation, but then we actually get ah projects in team, and teamwork is very important	train
audio_0_221857.wav	But this is not to say that these algorithms are all equally bad	train
audio_0_29202.wav	We have a base string here, which is first, second and we have these two funny things in braces	train
audio_0_145346.wav	Using a new type of sensor or actuator should not require to rewrite part of the operating system	train
audio_0_195289.wav	So, it is a feedback circuit	train
audio_0_178954.wav	If it if the situation is gamma 1 data will not get through that is outage that is 0	train
audio_0_103185.wav	We in turn invoke the corresponding member function in the B class	train
audio_0_96725.wav	As we have observed that provides a clean initialization, but the question is certainly what if the application forgets to call in it, or what if the application would call in it at a wrong position	train
audio_0_73026.wav	So, this amount is called the present value of the benefit	train
audio_0_203878.wav	Now, on that we would like to have a one more bolt to be fixed; for that purpose go to normal, now draw a sketch	train
audio_0_234862.wav	It is a benefit that, has been mandated by law	train
audio_0_219465.wav	If you have used certain document preparation systems which allow you to track changes, it will typically indicate the changes between one version of a document and other version like this	train
audio_0_38828.wav	Now, what am I can we give a interpretation to this equation	train
audio_0_154941.wav	On the other hand the deliberate stress on a particular syllable or on a particular word communicates our meanings and indicates our feelings towards other person	train
audio_0_84137.wav	which Hhe has kept it to make the total value close to 10 kilo ohm close to 10 kilo ohm 500 ohms	train
audio_0_34354.wav	This is like the j term you have a question no yeah	train
audio_0_155561.wav	In this particular video, we find that cultural variations in certain aspects of our behavior which was earlier considered to be universal are displayed in an interesting fashion	train
audio_0_82272.wav	So, now, you can see you can see right that now wwe arehave connected the probe first probe 1, and then we are connecting the output of the peak detector, output of the peak detector to the oscilloscope	train
audio_0_191264.wav	So, let us consider R to be Z, the ring of integers	train
audio_0_222053.wav	So, in general now remember that after we do this partitioning, we are going to have to quick sort this part and quick sort this part	train
audio_0_19664.wav	Now, based on this, you can work back and compute the number of units and also compute the other things	train
audio_0_169635.wav	So, finally what we got	train
audio_0_137203.wav	Next is oh, just a moment yeah, so what is the, similarly there could be delays between controller outputs and plant inputs right	train
audio_0_67515.wav	So, say for example, if you remember I told you that you have a shoe rack and all that stuff	train
audio_0_237661.wav	The other issue, that HR managers, constantly deal with, is employee rewards	train
audio_0_167717.wav	Now, if we have to convert them into s domain vt will become vs, it will become i s	train
audio_0_203704.wav	After that we draw a true shape from this view because auxiliary plane concept is useful when you have front views and top views are given, but these front views and top views may not be the true length information	train
audio_0_75389.wav	So, because you know the pillar displacement and if you know the stiffness material of this material then you can I exactly determine the force at each pillar	train
audio_0_632.wav	So, R 1 2 will become R 1 plus R 3; so, just clean it let me go right	train
audio_0_156462.wav	Now, and then we take the join of r1, natural join of r1 with r2, which is of course on X, this must give us back the relation R	train
audio_0_37854.wav	It would be the same because I have just drawn a line in air right the fields will be continuous across this hypothetical surface	train
audio_0_98203.wav	They are different types	train
audio_0_164242.wav	Similarly ZY will be 1 upon 3 of Z delta if you connect if you convert a star connected load into delta connected load, so we can say that the star connected or wye connected load can be transformed into delta connected load, or vice versa with the help of the star delta transformation which we discussed earlier	train
audio_0_147228.wav	This work is specifically focused on finding out the home location from social networks like foursquare, and there was a high confidence in finding out the home location with the foursquare check ins that people have done	train
audio_0_31986.wav	So, these are the equations that we will work within the course ok, once I solve this	train
audio_0_197774.wav	I'll say that this diode has a saturation current of 10 to the minus 15 ampers	train
audio_0_166272.wav	So, this is the signal flow graph if you get the first thing which you have to find out is forward path gain	train
audio_0_186713.wav	So, it is the probability of seeing a t random variable, which will be greater than the observed t statistic	train
audio_0_147664.wav	Now, let us collapse the filters and statistic tab and play around with the visualization of the data a bit	train
audio_0_67752.wav	So, our three cases studies are already defined x y z and this is your control, and this one this particular one this one could be a something which causes	train
audio_0_197848.wav	Let's say the supply voltage is for illustration 10 volts	train
audio_0_86747.wav	So, we can obtain it by using this command readelf r libmylib	train
audio_0_164422.wav	Here we are connecting a to b like this and similarly a is connected a is connected to b like this	train
audio_0_102410.wav	So, when I access it as a character I just get the 97 that I have stored there	train
audio_0_199678.wav	It is not that for this particular simple circuit this happened to be the case	train
audio_0_95744.wav	maybe ah there are certain other obstructions also	train
audio_0_1584.wav	So, in a DC motor when the armature rotates the conductors on it you are what you call cut the lines of force just hold on, cut the line, cut the lines of force of magnetic field in which they revolve right	train
audio_0_30568.wav	Now the proof sketch for this is fairly simple	train
audio_0_200235.wav	And this one let's say I connect it to ground	train
audio_0_52879.wav	this also shows the power of using h method sometimes	train
audio_0_146822.wav	Run time inefficiency, it is a bad we can have more efficient schedulers	train
audio_0_61244.wav	now we have taken in this example ah, four bit, l f s r, and we had seen that we has generated fifteen patterns	train
audio_0_104743.wav	And since in this case, in case of a signature we are not actually specifying how x and y will be used to compute the result	train
audio_0_216908.wav	ok, so let me know, turn my attention to another demonstration, ah, whereby you should see whether you can actually gets anything useful by exploiting the temperature differentials that exist around us	train
audio_0_101585.wav	And this will have a person, this will have a person other than that you will have different faculty data here, you will have the student data here, you will have the derive class this is the TA object	train
audio_0_148133.wav	So, this shows the same name here too	train
audio_0_188194.wav	Now, let us do the important task as far as this lecture is concerned which is implementation of K nearest neighbours in R	train
audio_0_196718.wav	And also when you carry out these calculations, it is always good to have some sort of sanity checks, some checks where by evaluating some extreme cases you can see whether the answer makes sense or not	train
audio_0_226400.wav	In metrology what happens there are multiple the distributions which are used or not in any even in metrology like in statistics the probability distributions are there	train
audio_0_152121.wav	In the year 2000, 100 billion photos were shot worldwide	train
audio_0_172599.wav	Anderson and Bloom will only identify four general categories of knowledge	train
audio_0_170238.wav	Now, i s, here you will add the initial condition that is i naught by S and then you pass on through 1 by cs, so you get the value of the ec and plus you add the initial condition that is ec by S	train
audio_0_187316.wav	So, this basically implies that null space of the matrix A does not contain any vectors and as we mentioned before these variables are linearly independent	train
audio_0_178768.wav	So, well what else can you do	train
audio_0_174852.wav	So this is a lowest level activity and we require to remember many things	train
audio_0_219785.wav	So, question we may ask is given such a map, how many colors do we need to color it to satisfy this criteria	train
audio_0_181659.wav	So, there are several interesting variations from what you would have already studied in a digital communication	train
audio_0_54736.wav	so h is going to be like we are giving rise to an h which is with positive charge here and negative charge here	train
audio_0_237739.wav	The law of unintended consequences, being forced to behave in a certain way means, that the subsequent act is no longer, one of ethical choice	train
audio_0_57801.wav	so from five we have reduced the delay to three	train
audio_0_83906.wav	This is my this is my bias current this is my these are these are small these are nothing, but my bias currents I b 1 and I b 2 you got it you got it easy right let me repeat once again let me repeat once again because this is very important input bias current input offset voltage very important	train
audio_0_102997.wav	So, we have seen that C has provided I mean because C did not take care of the errors situation the exception situation in the language designed, it come mostly as a post after thought	train
audio_0_87383.wav	So, when we have freed a2 the free allocation adds the chunk corresponding to this a2 pointer in a linked list and it marks then the in use bit in the next chunk as 0	train
audio_0_18217.wav	So, this is for v k; that means, v 1 is equal to 1 upon C 1 t 0 to t i it what you call dt plus v 1 t 0	train
audio_0_230464.wav	So, you can see that	train
audio_0_168681.wav	Now, in this case when you are defining the g parameters or you can say the inverse of h parameters, we will have the dependent variables as I1 and V2, independent variable will be V1 and I2	train
audio_0_223688.wav	So, you merge with count it takes a same amount of time as merging without counted, so we solve this and we get n log n	train
audio_0_56244.wav	variation means when these are fabricated, there will be some variations from one buffer to the other	train
audio_0_62652.wav	so we also talked about the design rule check and some design rules	train
audio_0_165353.wav	So, analogous elements we discussed in the last class and this session also that force is analogous to voltage, M is analogous to inductance, the viscous friction coefficient is analogous to R, spring constant is analogous to 1 by C, x is analogous to Q, x dot is analogous to i	train
audio_0_232224.wav	So, you cannot break that and insert to	train
audio_0_18771.wav	And therefore, these use this standard formula that V C t generalized formula rather V C t is equal to V C infinity plus V C 0 minus V C infinity e to the power minus t by tau	train
audio_0_93857.wav	so what happens is this really can be taken in a different manner and this is this is like disturbing	train
audio_0_110345.wav	This we will also be uploading this will be helpful in that	train
audio_0_122412.wav	So, as I said, it kind of emphasizes the loneliness, the isolation, the suffering that one undergoes especially at a difficult moment in one's personal journey, is highlighted here	train
audio_0_213183.wav	right, and lets see what happens to v l d o	train
audio_0_35104.wav	By doing that I will get away with a small value of capital N, if the actual solution is sinusoidal	train
audio_0_237867.wav	Seniority	train

audio_0_90848.wav	So in the next lecture in the series, we will see how we would get finer grained isolation, now the over heads over here is that we have several processes that get involved and each process communicates with the other using RPCs, so these RPCs are quite heavy because each of them involve a system call and therefore have the operating system running, so in the next lecture what we would see is more fine grained isolation mechanisms where isolation is achieved within a single process, thank you	train
audio_0_164540.wav	So that is if you have like KCL at node 2 what you can write	train

audio_0_97224.wav	So, casting is primarily required to convert the type of an object type of an expression a function, function argument, a return value etcetera to another type	train
audio_0_66098.wav	See for example, we have to culture the cells of the stomach which digest the food at a very acidic PH of course, from our knowledge of physiology, we know that that this acid production by the cells parietal cells chief cells which have present in the just for those taking this example in the stomach which is which functions at a very acidic PH	train
audio_0_77121.wav	Why because, if this is your nucleus you are probing from the top	train
audio_0_20691.wav	Only when revenue crosses the total cost, that is above breaking point, you reach a profit area	train
audio_0_197612.wav	Now this is approximate but it turns out that this approximation is quite good in a lot of practical context so we will use this widely	train
audio_0_173452.wav	So this is a kind of a summary of what they consider as the characteristics of a good engineer	train
audio_0_57361.wav	see, i am just showing a side by side a normal flip flop	train
audio_0_214951.wav	l e frame format, follows a particular order structure and that structure is understood by many applications which are, which you can download from apple store, ok and essentially, which will tell you few things about where you are, what you are doing, so on and so forth	train
audio_0_32113.wav	So, I exclude 1 and therefore, is the area of P 2 3 so that means, this area	train

audio_0_197746.wav	Basically it should behave like a short circuit	train
audio_0_229738.wav	This is very important graph it and today what we are trying to do is we are trying to convert this exponential into linear and we are also trying to shift rather trying to shift and make the cost as minimum as possible, we are trying to shift this here something like this point	train
audio_0_161212.wav	So if consider this example of there are three relations R1, R2, R3 and suppose R1 R2 is done fast and then that is joined with R3	train
audio_0_202337.wav	So, now, which now check now; so, both are both of these are moving in the same direction	train
audio_0_209718.wav	Perhaps arbitrarily, we are going to pick this one as the greater than half of AB	train
audio_0_200354.wav	And similarly because Y1 2 is 0, slope of I1 versus V2 is also 0	train
audio_0_174980.wav	But a teacher of any engineering course should be aware of the role of affective domain and psychomotor domain and wherever possible the activities related to affective learning should be incorporated by, by the teacher which will greatly enhance the quality of learning by the student	train
audio_0_209894.wav	First draw a reference line XY on the plane, then mark a point p' 15 mm above HP, so this is 15 mm above that HP	train

audio_0_202035.wav	And this saves us as dot asm	train
audio_0_1305.wav	Now when the coil is in like this position right, so flux moving from N to S and it is revolving	train
audio_0_227001.wav	Also you can see that when we leave the dial we leave the plunger sorry or the pointer it comes to the original position by itself	train
audio_0_28172.wav	So, if you run this indeed this is what we see right we have two lines, the first 7 comes from print y and the second level 22 comes from print x outside	train
audio_0_184705.wav	Example : gamma 1 is omitted and all we have is the gamma 2 and gamma 3	train
audio_0_182259.wav	So, that is why the spread spectrum system works so well	train
audio_0_51335.wav	next problem, number seven, is light is incident normally on glass slab	train
audio_0_77923.wav	So, Dbr is also the minimum distance between two branching points	train
audio_0_178215.wav	Now, the purple line is going to decay as distance from the this base station is going and it will count the distance from this base station from the right side and you find that at some point this purple base line will also cut the blue line, but probably long before it cut the blue line it actually intersected the green line	train
audio_0_103519.wav	So, these are therefore, this is why I am highlighting here these are the data members, which are inherited; they do not have to be there cannot be listed in this class	train
audio_0_147404.wav	So, that is the one of the differences between the Facebook and twitter network, particularly keeping this trust and credibility as the space of discussion	train
audio_0_207891.wav	For example, we have a block; perhaps may be cut plane is that, which pass through these points	train
audio_0_224152.wav	So, when we delete this, we also delete the incoming edges	train
audio_0_56180.wav	now, after we have labeled it, phase two consists of the retrace phase	train
audio_0_217086.wav	ah, are are good, ok, and you must going place the energy harvester there, ok	train
audio_0_228749.wav	So, similar examples can be solved using this relation and relations for relative error, relation for absolute errors similar examples can solved, I will better more focus more on the theoretical part in this course	train
audio_0_71487.wav	Next category is direct and cost	train
audio_0_174445.wav	And then further you should be able to give and receive clear instructions	train
audio_0_18129.wav	So, 4 into i 2 minus i 1 and I told you earlier i 1 is equal to 2 ampere	train
audio_0_61750.wav	so this output has to be carried to this point	train
audio_0_76412.wav	It essentially because the instrument is recording everything in terms of volts; what you are interested in is in deflection which is in nanometers	train
audio_0_102434.wav	So, it is a variable whose value is a memory address	train
audio_0_187161.wav	472	train
audio_0_39677.wav	Now, supposing you want to design a resonator to work at some frequency how will FDTD will help us in that	train

audio_0_220198.wav	Now, initially we have to sort the edges	train
audio_0_193438.wav	So, now, we have defined what it means for an element to be a divisor of another element, what it means for an element to be a proper divisor of another element and we also defined the notion of associates	train
audio_0_51255.wav	if this term was not there, if the second equation was not there, that means, if the electric field, changing electric field, did not give rise to a magnetic field, this term will not be there and therefore i'll not get a wave equation, i'll not get a, get a propagative wave solution	train
audio_0_202985.wav	For example, here let us look at that	train
audio_0_142605.wav	Such a practice was done by several of its global subsidiaries but in US books it was reported as a profit mainly coming from internal income	train
audio_0_40445.wav	Now so, what happens to this equation	train
audio_0_232471.wav	So, it is important to note down these things, so that you don’t forget, and apart from that I said that you need to train your memory and you can do that by playing games or practice activities that we utilize your memory such as solving puzzles, playing chess and learning a new language, keep the mind active	train
audio_0_79486.wav	What was also observed was compared to C57 cells tissue from C57, but the average stiffness was order 12 kPa is similar to normal muscle, MDX muscle tissue was nearly 1	train
audio_0_26023.wav	So, we get a space here, because, that is from this comma; we get a space here, which is from this comma; we get a space here, which is from this comma	train
audio_0_153733.wav	At this distance touch is also not possible and therefore, we find that in certain offices spaces this is the designated space for certain tasks	train
audio_0_5407.wav	So, it is 120 watt similarly, we saw I ab square R ab is equal to 122 R; that means, it is matching if it is not; that means, how much calculate some if it is not somewhere calculation has gone wrong somewhere right so, this is 1	train
audio_0_215684.wav	after this tag chip gets powered, after that chip is powered, the chip basically has to give this data back to the reader	train
audio_0_61727.wav	ok, so this is what i mentioned: the cost function cost two penalizes the overlapping and similarly, cost three penalizes the unequal lengths of the rows	train
audio_0_31729.wav	And we will give a physical interpretation to every term; this thing is something that you have not encountered	train

audio_0_229046.wav	I mean just put this later I will just put here N is equal to 100, the value of N here is 100	train
audio_0_224569.wav	So, we have not shown it, we have just explained what is the mathematics required in order to show this	train
audio_0_237631.wav	The law does not support, conformed observations	train
audio_0_186596.wav	Now, K means clustering can have di culty with this kind of data simply be cause if you look at data within this class, this point and this point are quite far though they are within the same class whereas, this point and this point might be closer than this point in this point	train
audio_0_183700.wav	So, my expectation that I did in previous graph becomes expected value of h of t comma tau magnitude square	train
audio_0_130979.wav	delta t is maximum in the evaporator section and depends on the value of pinch temperature selected, a finite value of pinch, so pinches here, so a finite value of pinch has to be taken to avoid temperature crossover	train
audio_0_208275.wav	Then, what we can do is from this a ' to b ' make an arc which cuts this locus line and project that line all the way down to this locus line	train
audio_0_106956.wav	So, the oral formulaic tradition unless the substance is captured in some medium can remain outside the purview of the copyright regime, because the copyright regime requires things to be recorded or expressed on some medium	train
audio_0_172590.wav	One can combinedly read any outcome which student should be able to do something	train
audio_0_61805.wav	ok, so this is how the model is created	train
audio_0_212706.wav	full featured, full featured toolkit	train
audio_0_65015.wav	so the zero force location has been calculated as one point zero, eight, three and one point five and if you do a round of it comes to one coma two nearest integer values	train
audio_0_107396.wav	Then that product can be regarded as a subject matter of a geographical indication, and they can be a separate right that can be registered, and this right is called the geographical indication or GI	train
audio_0_205562.wav	So, that it becomes tangent to this arc	train
audio_0_78141.wav	So, you have mesenchymal migration or adhesion dependent, you have amoeboid migration which requires weak adhesions or no adhesions and towards the end of last lecture I had introduced another mode of migration which is collective cell migration	train
audio_0_61429.wav	so if you do a similar calculation, you will find that del f del a will be b bar, which means for this case, if you want to propagate the signal your b has, b bar has to be true, that mean b has to be zero	train
audio_0_228767.wav	So, the type B uncertainties are the uncertainties which are not random which may or may not repeat each time	train
audio_0_223561.wav	So, recall the divide and conquer paradigm consists of breaking up a problem into disjoint subproblems	train
audio_0_142042.wav	This is a infrastructure or a property which is going to last for more than one year it acts as a catalyst in our operations	train
audio_0_43773.wav	Now, looking at this; they you get an intuition of which form to which form is physically acceptable	train
audio_0_110248.wav	Similarly, X bar also can be written as that sum u v things u and v both are real quantities, so now we are having an equation that there are no complex thing in this equation all the left hand side and right hand side they are real quantities	train
audio_0_20036.wav	75 because 75% is a variable component, B 12 into 0	train
audio_0_37550.wav	U continues to be so, U of x we will continue to write it as in this form right U i e N i e x that is that is what I will write it as this is also equal to in very short compact notation what is this U 1 N 1 plus U 2 T 2 plus U 3 T 3 plus U 4 let us call it N 4	train
audio_0_39165.wav	So, lambda is also unknown, you can think of this as the equivalent of a eigenvalue problem	train

audio_0_62414.wav	ok, now, in many text books, this same information, which is shown in a tabular fashion like this, it is represented like this: as if this is the fault free version of your gate, and these are the three faulty versions, is shown like this	train
audio_0_224327.wav	So, we say that okay let i be the current position I am looking at in this, j be the current position I am looking at in B, and k be the current position I am trying to fill in C	train
audio_0_107591.wav	Now, in India there are certain statutory requirements like form 27, which is a working statement	train
audio_0_224602.wav	So, this takes some time and it take some resources and so, usually the cost of making a function call, even though we might account for it in our complexity as a basic operation is much more than doing some really arithmetic operation like addition or something	train
audio_0_207360.wav	So, for that purpose, what we are going to do	train
audio_0_198108.wav	This was explained earlier while discussing the original common source amplifier	train

audio_0_55383.wav	here let me give two different scenarios	train
audio_0_94366.wav	the first is you need to be aware, because the topic of the gd may be anything and everything, so you need to have a sort of awareness	train
audio_0_31704.wav	R prime right, because I am integrating over the place where the current source and all is	train
audio_0_83041.wav	So, he is changing from almost 220, 230 hertz, right 230 hertz, and he is changing so, guys you focus on the oscilloscope, alright	train

audio_0_205295.wav	What about side view	train
audio_0_48717.wav	at this point the displacement is y	train
audio_0_95693.wav	but if you observe a person for three days or if you observe at an incident, ah, if you observe at the traffic flow for three days regularly, of course you may have some idea, but remember, when you are observing, you should also ask yourself who is the person, who, whom you want to observe and why you are observing him	train
audio_0_161472.wav	And just to take it a little bit further, so suppose there is a transaction commit T0 after which there is a checkpoint is being written	train
audio_0_227320.wav	So, larger the radius the more sensitive is the spirit level	train

audio_0_213428.wav	i will call it simply fridge	train
audio_0_27268.wav	Now, why is there blank lines between every line in our file that is because when we readlines we get a backslash n character from the line itself	train
audio_0_73379.wav	So we can also rank them as high risk or medium risk or low risk projects using some scoring method, using some formula are given by using some weights and a risk and the risk premiums designated for each category for if it is a very high what the risk project we may consider like 15% for example 5% extra may be 15% what premium risk premium or discount rate and if it is a medium risk project we may use might be what we can take 13% or so of this what discount rate if it is a very low one we can take 11% or 12% as the discount rate and then we can classify them so the premiums even if you are considering them arbitrary if you have even if you have taken them arbitrarily but still they provide a consistent method of taking risks into account	train
audio_0_188906.wav	I have just done some colour coding in terms of the techniques that you will see in this course in green	train

audio_0_210242.wav	If we know that information only we will be in a position to represent these two supposed to be connected by these edges	train
audio_0_159680.wav	There is no read after read conflict because if there are two transactions that are reading the same item, the X, it doesn't matter in which order they read	train
audio_0_235261.wav	And, so you know, I will say, okay, great	train
audio_0_132340.wav	it is very difficult to satisfy both of them	train
audio_0_55649.wav	one thing is not mentioned: if it is total negative slack, we will also have to mention another condition: that slack tau p should be less than equal to zero, right, but here, since you are assuming, in terms of a constraint, that slack tau p will less than equal to zero, so it will be either zero or negative	train
audio_0_103956.wav	A get function say on the read write on this variable say has a name get read write, it is simply takes this data member and returns it	train

audio_0_60273.wav	so here you have to consider this charging, discharging for all the nodes, not only the output node, right	train
audio_0_180575.wav	The actual impact is very much seen when you look at it in the time domain, again we will have an exercise to generate this in MATLAB	train
audio_0_141667.wav	Long term loans and advances	train
audio_0_498.wav	Because if I a increases, so V by I a will decrease right, therefore with the increase in load speed decreases for series motor	train
audio_0_223734.wav	Then, from this 30 we will either hire or fire some to get the workers in the empty, then if hire or fire some to get February and so on	train
audio_0_93907.wav	hence, people who are in intimate bonds with each other are people of closed circle, family people, people who are kins, relatives or are very close to us	train

audio_0_134608.wav	Case studies of course they have advantage	train
audio_0_194628.wav	So, consider the ideal 0 ideal the 0 ideal in R is not prime	train
audio_0_174629.wav	But the main thing is unless you have used rubrics to evaluate or include rubrics that evaluates specific POs you cannot tag a course with that PO or the project with that PO	train
audio_0_121516.wav	That is a safe assumption that we can make in the context of many, which is why she gives up all her friendships with the men in her society	train
audio_0_96026.wav	so when we talk about consideration, we have to be considerate, not only above the language, but also about the content, about the length	train
audio_0_121549.wav	So, as I mentioned, I just would like to sum up that point and say that the father slash author narrator and the Kabaliwala, both of them, even though both of them have dysfunctional domesticities, the author, the author figure in the story has a better domesticity than the Kabiliwala who hardly gets to see his daughter due to the nature of his profession which makes him travel away from his home and country	train
audio_0_234009.wav	And then, one can decide, whether the training has been effective or not	train

audio_0_173029.wav	If you look at, let us spend a little time with all the keywords in that	train
audio_0_1769.wav	So, question is that here this 6 ampere current actually	train
audio_0_79299.wav	So, when you take a cell that this is the substrate and this is your cell	train
audio_0_183865.wav	So, basically these this means from different generator polynomials and here again you will find that there are not too many generator polynomials, if you want to take order 4 there is only 2 available	train
audio_0_159348.wav	Then these two have also been swapped	train
audio_0_137946.wav	And at what pressure this poppet will start moving and will open the line to the drain, that depends on the spring and this, and this pressure can be adjusted by tightening this screw	train

audio_0_190206.wav	So, what are constant polynomials	train
audio_0_76563.wav	So, this sharp tip is much preferred for imaging purposes	train
audio_0_215426.wav	then we will do some demos because ultimately you have to start designing your i o t system with a r f i d tag, let us say, and a r f i d solutions for your application, and then you will have to which ah go across many different design choices under which you have to see that what, what is the type of tag to use, what is a type of reader to use, what should be the polarization of the reader	train
audio_0_36649.wav	So, in a, let us say a homogeneous medium, we know that a plane wave is traveling right	train
audio_0_210186.wav	Try to imagine how an object really looks like in 3D and try to represent that in isometric views	train
audio_0_12821.wav	If you if you come to this one, if you come to this response this this one, I mean this one look ah this one, it is this is the thing you are obtaining at infinity and this is your initial value	train
audio_0_191367.wav	So, if you have a bunch of elements inside I intersection J their sum is in I intersection J	train
audio_0_66009.wav	We will come later into that part why I am highlighting that because there are issues which are being faced by people while trying to repeat some of these results in different parts of the world and then they realize that it is kind of what I should say it is kind of very incisive incoherent results which people meet	train
audio_0_200323.wav	This is okay	train
audio_0_100564.wav	You can actually use that address as a value and do different things	train
audio_0_229648.wav	If you go for this it will be looking forward turning plus grinding plus you will look for some super finishing process some super finishing process, we do not know what is it, but you will look for a super finishing process	train
audio_0_99641.wav	Earlier we saw it for function templates now you are seen it for class template, we will have to make sure that the parameters the type parameters that are used in the template they will satisfy certain properties that is they may be of any type	train
audio_0_80234.wav	So, let us assume that this is 159	train
audio_0_50175.wav	the other e m f, which is generated in the system, is minus l d i by d t is equal to	train
audio_0_210978.wav	So, we have to look at from this direction	train
audio_0_96812.wav	We have been discussing the precidiaral extensions of C for C++, this is the part of better C of C++, and we have already discussed several features starting from const, inline function, reference parameter and so on	train
audio_0_233797.wav	The opportunities and encouragement, within an organization, constitute informal learning	train
audio_0_146037.wav	That's the worst case context switch time is let's say C millisecond	train
audio_0_182086.wav	Previously you could transmit some information now it looks like you have you have you know 4 b that is 4 channels with bandwidth b that is the effect of and all of them are getting diversity benefit there also managing the handle the interference and giving you the rate	train
audio_0_152611.wav	Micro expressions can also be controlled voluntary and involuntary	train
audio_0_155503.wav	Some people actually call these crows feet	train
audio_0_93220.wav	but you have to create a sort of balance between the expectation of the recruiters and your own confidence, qualification, commitment and a enthusiasm level	train
audio_0_39962.wav	Sir, what is the right hand side in the	train
audio_0_108743.wav	Now, evaluation of disclosure is again something that pertains to IP administration done by the IP centre and a filing foreign application is what we call PCT filings is again something that has to be provided in the IP policy	train
audio_0_168365.wav	You will get an another super mesh which is the union of both of the super meshes and you will call it as larger super mesh	train
audio_0_91335.wav	So, this becomes 9	train
audio_0_220813.wav	So, unfortunately it turns out that no single sorting algorithm is always guaranteed to be the best, it really depends as, we said like sorting depth, the movement and other criteria	train
audio_0_50453.wav	you see, if i look so here is the in a cavity is point dipole field out here is zero	train
audio_0_26486.wav	On the other hand, if we find the value in the tree we do nothing and if we do not find the value then we just use the search tree property and try to insert either on the left or on the right as appropriate	train
audio_0_42939.wav	So, this is conjugate H and take half of it right	train
audio_0_96843.wav	And it is a responsibility of the programmer as in here where we will need to cast that pointer with the appropriate type, since we want an integer to be stored look at the left hand side, we will cross this as int star	train
audio_0_218163.wav	ok, so, depending on what your embedded system would require, ah, you would either choose a linear l d o or linear regulator, like an l d o, or a a buck converter like ah, the switching regulator, such as the buck converter	train
audio_0_56806.wav	you comes to the end of this particular lecture	train
audio_0_193420.wav	So, in Z, this what is this what happens	train
audio_0_115969.wav	so the total time for which the application to run in a month is equal to twelve cross thirty three, sixty hours	train
audio_0_9498.wav	And c here is 1 micro farad that means 10 to the power minus 6 farad	train
audio_0_94036.wav	all of us are only half awake	train
audio_0_83464.wav	So, now you know that frequency stability is very important when we talk about the oscillators, and that particularly crystals	train
audio_0_147457.wav	If we put together the identification actually becomes much stronger, you are able to uniquely identify more people with more data put together	train
audio_0_65442.wav	And this is the dorsal horn, dorsal horn	train
audio_0_205084.wav	So, our triangle now let us call c', if we are projecting all the way up in the this will be the length of our projection in the top view	train
audio_0_79455.wav	So, if you track the time to recovery and the recovery time	train
audio_0_99650.wav	But I can still define a pointer to this type; I can define a reference to this type	train
audio_0_51920.wav	in all this we had taken r vector is not equal to prime vector, because then this term you evaluation, whatever mathematics i am doing, not be evaluated if i add all this	train
audio_0_31646.wav	The other terms it is not very clear how they will get simplified ok, so, let us let us see how they will	train
audio_0_43568.wav	So, this is the sort of flow that we will go through something sort of significant over here is we are going to directly look at vector finite elements; what I have shown you so for are node based in 1D and I have showed you the shape functions for node based in 2D ok	train
audio_0_62531.wav	so the inputs is a set of modules with well define shape	train
audio_0_208289.wav	And, there make 55 mm length to mark our b'	train
audio_0_237618.wav	You tried everything in your capacity	train
audio_0_96055.wav	when i say simple, i mean the choice of words has to be simple and the choice of words have to be specific	train
audio_0_144497.wav	I am hoping that you would have found the lectures as well as the assignments very much useful for your learning process	train
audio_0_193724.wav	In this video, we looked at more examples of, more properties of irreducible and prime elements	train
audio_0_84389.wav	This is the operation, like I said it is an operation, because now is the right now it is in mathematical mode	train
audio_0_135331.wav	So, from 1 hour, that is 60 minutes to 9 hours you just have an addition of 3 percent of loss, whereas in the first 20 minutes you have a massive down fall, 47 percent of information is lost	train
audio_0_36876.wav	So, if I plug this expression back into this that is I mean that is what will help me evaluating this is much cheaper than evaluating Hankel function right	train
audio_0_55136.wav	now there is a additional optional step, like these routes which are generated, the wires	train
audio_0_203529.wav	So, same command like rectangle one can construct squares also	train
audio_0_174833.wav	We will come to that at a later point	train
audio_0_207161.wav	Now, we have variation of sections in the same material at different planes	train
audio_0_89291.wav	) Then he computes what the address of the buffer should be and fills the remaining part of the large string with the buffer address	train
audio_0_20917.wav	With this we will stop here	train
audio_0_154318.wav	There are several other aspects which have been left out of discussion	train
audio_0_235950.wav	These are behaviors, that people around us, indulge in	train
audio_0_52536.wav	now, this b, due to both the free current as well as the bound currents	train
audio_0_106500.wav	So, illustrations and examples are normally there where there is a method involved in preparing something, say a chemical substance	train
audio_0_102302.wav	Then array can also be initialized, we are moving to the second part	train
audio_0_180944.wav	So, all of these together are given to that cell marked as a similarly to B to C and then any cell that is marked A any cell that is marked as A has the same set of frequencies	train
audio_0_114214.wav	So, this is an example of a systematic error you have, If you have open there also the reflection coefficient should be plus one, but you can have an who is not giving plus one it may giving one thirty degree	train
audio_0_135221.wav	Now in this condition as you can see the slider is at the center position, you have to move the slider to toward outside, that you can make this line equal into this arrow headed line	train
audio_0_102379.wav	So, if you go back to I am sorry, if you go back to this structure, then you will see that here after the complex structure has been defined it has two components	train
audio_0_183944.wav	Now remember we said that we are using Walsh Hadamard codes basically we use 64 length Walsh Hadamard codes	train
audio_0_69419.wav	Now, if you realize each one of these tissues which are there in our body, they are not continuously in an oxygenated environment	train
audio_0_211114.wav	So, to construct these 1 2 3 parts what we are going to do is again we will divide this 90 into 4 parts	train
audio_0_213443.wav	again, this always means that you have calibrated the i c properly	train
audio_0_38411.wav	So, it is a nice looking expression right we did not expect that it will simplify so nicely, but that is what we got ok	train
audio_0_229768.wav	So here why is the need for unilateral tolerance	train
audio_0_51739.wav	divided twenty one, divided by r plus ten	train
audio_0_180608.wav	It is going to be more or less you are going to going to see that constant line of sight component present being present	train
audio_0_140929.wav	So socially appropriate chews they are more apparent on the right side of the face	train
audio_0_219054.wav	So, these two problem look connected and in fact they are	train
audio_0_163671.wav	So, electrical magnetic field can be interchange etcetera	train
audio_0_28152.wav	So, if you run this now this global version, we get exactly the same output	train
audio_0_43119.wav	So, you learn one technique and you have not studied other techniques, so, you applied everywhere we do not want to do that	train
audio_0_82922.wav	So, with the input voltages are ground both the terminals are grounded ok, now we are understanding output voltage, from where output voltage, we can measure the output voltage at pin number 6 with or between pin number 6 and ground	train
audio_0_160800.wav	So recovery is the one that ensures that atomicity is maintained	train
audio_0_170499.wav	So in that case this particular voltage would be nothing but VTh	train
audio_0_94427.wav	so, these people, they are actually the disturbing elements in a group	train
audio_0_7108.wav	When we will listen this video, right just see that what; what we are discussing, right	train
audio_0_30902.wav	So, what is this guy	train
audio_0_42713.wav	Yeah, that is it V A by delta and what is E i over here	train
audio_0_56069.wav	with respect to the lmo delay model, if we consider distributed resistances and capacitances, the delay is propositional to the square of the length	train
audio_0_100841.wav	So, if we take a parameter other at the time of call by value, then this parameter will also need to be made available to this constructor	train
audio_0_110476.wav	So, 1 Giga hertz mean 30 centimeter lambda, you can find out L is 0	train
audio_0_8070.wav	So, if you do so, then this is your at node 1 and this equation right whatever I said right and this this is your what you call, this is your this is that equation ah this is that equation right is equal to 9	train
audio_0_37365.wav	You will have to update the the E y value yeah	train
audio_0_87151.wav	So this fast clock violates setup and hold times of various gates in this AES circuit resulting in a faulty output	train
audio_0_196347.wav	And in this particular case, I will connect a voltage source v test and find the current I test	train
audio_0_191190.wav	So, I just to preview what I will do next, but I said that every ideal in Z is a principal ideal generated by a positive integer n or of course 0, non negative integer n I should say	train
audio_0_121443.wav	With that, I took out a half a rupee coin and gave it to him	train
audio_0_74401.wav	So, I had touched upon solve the things about the different cell types which exist within our body and just to reemphasis the fact, the cells come in different sizes and different shapes	train
audio_0_233776.wav	So, identify faulty work patterns	train
audio_0_184870.wav	The important one is the concept that we are taking away from there the SNR came out to be minus 14	train
audio_0_65632.wav	cantilevers are all must have heard about afm, right, so cantilevers are something, some structures like this	train
audio_0_212756.wav	therefore, people have sort of abandon dns sec and decided that everything they want to do is with respect to open ssl and therefore security in the openssl becomes a very important ah, very important tool kit that you should understand and pay a lot of attention to mqtt s security related settings	train
audio_0_57137.wav	it is sixteen	train
audio_0_154513.wav	However, at the same time if it is supported by the rest of the clustering of our kinesics postures it can also indicate a certain sense of insecurity and lack of self confidence	train
audio_0_124399.wav	i can also compute v o one minus v o two	train
audio_0_118376.wav	so there are several aspects of the things like	train
audio_0_55454.wav	so for the first net, it is coming from here, it is going here	train
audio_0_157793.wav	So if T1, the redoing of T1 is done fast and then the undoing of T0 is done, T2, T0 may then roll back the value to what T1 has been written, so what T1 has written, so that is not the correct thing	train
audio_0_121199.wav	All these different categories of people are implicated in the moral corruption in the moral epidemic that in the immoral epidemic that's running through the entire society	train
audio_0_44290.wav	To find the field anywhere	train
audio_0_28326.wav	So, for the row with holes, wherever we hit a hole instead of writing the value that we would normally get by adding its left and bottom neighbour we deliberately put a 0 because; that means, that no path is actually allowed propagating through that row	train
audio_0_220975.wav	So, for the most part we will look at basic operations as what we would consider single statement or steps in a high level language	train
audio_0_59962.wav	that means there is one input combination zero, zero, zero for which delay equal to two is not satisfiable	train
audio_0_150543.wav	So, that is basically a sense of what location based privacy is	train
audio_0_33109.wav	What is the first equation telling you or rather where is it coming from	train
audio_0_58224.wav	so, ah, lets i just work this out your, because it will be easier for you to understand	train
audio_0_57753.wav	similarly we can do for the output side, like, not only the input lines but also the output load capacitance you can balance across the different ah sigma	train
audio_0_196191.wav	The operating point of course satisfies this equation	train
audio_0_238848.wav	And then, after a while, after your probation period is over, or you finished your training, you become part of the flock	train
audio_0_239044.wav	We know that, say most of the employees, for example, are able to work	train
audio_0_39934.wav	Source point is the second element falling on K	train
audio_0_104624.wav	So, the dynamic cast itself, the operator itself cannot overcome this that is the reason you get invalid expression type for dynamic cast that is the basic	train
audio_0_66128.wav	So, every medium what we develop will have glucose as one of the major sources of energy and more over carbon, but that comes with some set of problems which will be coming later we use glutamine and other sources there are reason and rhyme	train
audio_0_190563.wav	Another reason is, if for example, X power 4 is in R prime, X power minus X power 4 plus X squared in R prime, but if you add these two, but what is the sum of these two	train
audio_0_182234.wav	Inversely proportional to the bandwidth	train
audio_0_207269.wav	Any drawing we would like to begin as a new one the recommended plane to begin is front plane	train
audio_0_184773.wav	Now, the key point is we have multiple users, it is not one signal that you are trying to hide, you actually have multiple users, multiple signals, and that is where you have the orange and the pink and the, then eventually you have to recover these signals	train
audio_0_115601.wav	it is basically say the prevent misuse of resources, so you should have that particular resource, particular access ah to a particular resource center so that you can use that resources	train
audio_0_105406.wav	If they add in other division possibly something like sales division possibly something like sales executive will come in	train
audio_0_145913.wav	And these are very small programs run for a few microseconds, just few lines of code and incur very less runtime overhead	train
audio_0_179675.wav	Because if I do not get gamma naught then basically I do not get a water level then I cannot do water filling	train
audio_0_9495.wav	And again from 4 to 5 micro second, it is time varying; in between 2 to 4 micro second, it is constant; this voltage source is given right	train
audio_0_152350.wav	So, essentially this is saying that there are people who are posting both real and fake information, there are people who are 2 percent of the total number of unique users who posted fake information also	train
audio_0_35069.wav	How will this guy look	train
audio_0_94086.wav	you might be knowing how roosevelt was quite weak, how demon stance, who actually stuttered a lot, but then through practice he came to be one of the greatest auditors	train
audio_0_17208.wav	So, same thing so, it is 12 minus v by 4 that is your i 1 this is the first thing rest are simple right	train
audio_0_162064.wav	, so, if another choice is that suppose I do not want any side lobe, so actually this method what I said that is called Fourier series method already you have seen	train
audio_0_56588.wav	so what you get at the output is some kind of statistics with respect to fault coverage: which are the faults that are detected, which are the faults which are not getting detected, and so on	train
audio_0_181908.wav	It needed to estimate Z 1 and Z 2 and it also had to feedback this information, and that was the feedback channel	train
audio_0_206114.wav	So, it comes on the right side, that means, is supposed to come here	train
audio_0_61667.wav	you cannot make the move	train
audio_0_26846.wav	So, we can have multiple just like we have nested list where we can have a list containing list and then we have two indices take the 0th list and then their first position in the 0 list, we can have two levels of keys	train
audio_0_41012.wav	What else should be known	train
audio_0_210556.wav	So, helix begins at starting of this arrow, goes around the cylinder around which we want to construct this cut	train
audio_0_83146.wav	If the resistance value is higher, noise will increase	train
audio_0_171520.wav	Now, in this session we will talk more about the basic concepts of electric circuits	train
audio_0_41858.wav	If they are comparable, I must keep both of them and this is the basic idea ok	train
audio_0_76557.wav	This in short it is referred to as AFM	train
audio_0_56372.wav	this, and suppose this is your propagation delay before d two reaches propagation delay of this line	train
audio_0_195156.wav	5 volts this will go into triode region	train
audio_0_202703.wav	First, we always project it on to the vertical plane because, that is easy thing to do	train
audio_0_104835.wav	But in C, certainly we cannot have two functions having the same name	train
audio_0_67769.wav	So, what you are quantifying	train
audio_0_74242.wav	This is the Renkawitz et al, paper Nature Cell Biology 2010	train
audio_0_214371.wav	so let me just put down a very simple picture for you	train
audio_0_44566.wav	So as far as the Buck Hattverter operation is concerned concerned, the Buck portion that is the LNC is exactly same as before	train
audio_0_222806.wav	So, you say, that you want to sort A from start to n where start is the index of the unsorted segment where it begins and n is the total size	train
audio_0_14428.wav	So, encountering plus terminal plus , I am not showing again and again by your blue ink	train
audio_0_59354.wav	they can be small, they can be big, they can be square, they can be rectangular	train
audio_0_149293.wav	The client id and client secret are the same as the APP ID and APP Secret that we just obtained in the last screen when we created the APP test nptel	train
audio_0_224180.wav	So, minus 1 means it cannot be in the graph, because you cannot have minus 1 edges pointing you can have at least 0 edges or more	train
audio_0_187608.wav	Now, if you going to ask whether this; the character variable which have created 21 11 2001 is this character type variable, you can use this command is dot character the result is true because you have defined it as a character variable	train
audio_0_153939.wav	At the same time we find that eyes communicate is certain sense of trustworthiness	train
audio_0_220521.wav	So, one last point before we leave prim's algorithm	train
audio_0_53257.wav	this is like also like a current term, right, this is also like a current term, but it's in addition and this makes this mathematically consistent this term that we have just added this extra term, epsilon zero, d e d t is known as the displacement current because it is related to this quantity called displacement d, which is epsilon zero e in free space	train
audio_0_67484.wav	it took several years for us to standardize some of these techniques, as a matter of fact, almost more than a half a decade	train
audio_0_63599.wav	ah same is you must have heard of this scud missiles which are used in the world fair with	train
audio_0_108048.wav	So, you can still enter the mobile phone business because, as long as you use your own unique mark and come up with a product, nobody can have any grievance against you	train
audio_0_101137.wav	We define a variable j and initialize it with i	train
audio_0_149992.wav	So, now, what all we have seen, we have seen the time, consecutive, tips or dones that is done with respect to time, consecutive tips and dones with respect to distance	train
audio_0_83006.wav	What we need	train
audio_0_13533.wav	Because when when ah your it is reaching peak value current is here	train
audio_0_21535.wav	I can show you the solution but try to do it mentally	train
audio_0_155968.wav	So this is the database D and then under it there are assumed there are just two tables, R1 and R2	train
audio_0_56626.wav	so this line is going noway and here i am applying a constant zero to simulate the effect of stuck at zero	train
audio_0_159320.wav	Now why are we studying it	train
audio_0_94871.wav	and then comes the nonverbal aspect, and where we talk about	train
audio_0_190067.wav	We have proved using the same argument prove that 3 is irreducible and similar argument tells you that 1 plus root minus 5 and 1 minus root minus 5 are irreducible, so these are distinct irreducible factorizations	train
audio_0_75428.wav	So, we have introduce started discussing about the structure of the nucleus and this, in this context we had introduced you have proteins or lamins which are intermediate filament proteins, which serve and this lamins are part of the LINC complex, LINC stands for linker of nuclear skeleton and cytoskeleton ok	train
audio_0_104735.wav	And, we will use void if there is nothing to return	train
audio_0_17253.wav	So, solve this equa[tion] your what we call equation 1 2 and 3 and for v you will get v is equal to v 1 is equal to 4	train
audio_0_106789.wav	So, this in law be referred to as the proof of right	train
audio_0_18638.wav	So, we will take it integration will take T 4 T by 4 to T by 2 why, if you come to this if you come to this, this is if we take this is 0, then this point is T by 4 and this point is T by 2 and this is 3 T by 4 and this is T	train
audio_0_225597.wav	So, this is the spanning tree form of Kruskal's algorithm, we actually scan through all the edges in this particular case and on the way we dropped a couple	train
audio_0_82589.wav	A simple passive high pass filter can be easily made by connecting together in series a single resistor with a single capacitor as shown in figure 2	train

audio_0_141692.wav	So, you can see here because of the rise in current liabilities, rise of about 44% there is a fall in the ratio	train
audio_0_26222.wav	And, this is pretty much what happens, with functions like range and d dot keys and so on	train
audio_0_225622.wav	If the two end points are in the same component then it will form a cycle	train
audio_0_232209.wav	So, ninth one: the use of relations is incorrect here, when you say, I have good relations with my customers	train
audio_0_156724.wav	So these are the five operations that is done	train
audio_0_56212.wav	now, see, we have ah discussed a method which is simple in concept and also it guarantees that it will give you the minimum length solution or the shortest path whenever it can find one, because you are exploring all paths parallely at each step, ah, distance of one, distance of two, distance of three, all the cells which are at a distance of i we are considering in parallel	train

audio_0_239212.wav	Yes, I know that, about myself	train
audio_0_72487.wav	So we have to see why we are lagging	train
audio_0_148092.wav	So, this looks much more like a genuine nptel page	train
audio_0_1092.wav	So, power across the air gap will be 3 I 1 square R f because at that time I mean if I if I make it here if I make it here	train
audio_0_175394.wav	For example, I may have the present year, I have attained 0	train
audio_0_236727.wav	But, i would not want to do it, again, and again	train
audio_0_57314.wav	only if this bits are equal, then only you activate this	train
audio_0_149958.wav	So, therefore, there is a chance that there are mayorships in that location, but not tips	train
audio_0_12310.wav	So, that is why that is why it is V 1 minus V 2 into I 1 is equal to I 2 minus I 1 into V 2	train
audio_0_219155.wav	now, we come back to the top Fibonacci of 5, we have got the left branch, we need the right branch, we go to Fibonacci of 3, earlier we had blindly reproduces the entire tree at the bottom in order to get Fibonacci of 3, but this time we are smarter, we go down the table and we find that 3 has been computed before and the value is 2, so we get this value of 2	train
audio_0_50715.wav	ok, taking into account the similarity of the equations of, we want to take into account the similarity of equations of: curl of b is equal to mu naught j and curl of a is equal to b	train
audio_0_51312.wav	so this going to be twenty divided by twenty, five times five m m, and that comes out to be four m m	train
audio_0_194268.wav	So, the kernel is 0; that means, it is an injective map	train
audio_0_100240.wav	So, p b is a pointer to the b object, p d is a pointer to the d object, but both of them are of B type	train
audio_0_63099.wav	now, with respect to that, let us try to systematically construct a tree	train
audio_0_27242.wav	If we want to get with a new line character, remember this is only a string and the new line character is going to be a last character in this string	train
audio_0_145048.wav	Then there was one item called exceptional item, this 47	train
audio_0_11255.wav	Here it is V L, but do not take V L minus V C means; it will become plus do not do that	train
audio_0_29320.wav	Likewise if we define d to be an empty dictionary then we can use a function such as d dot values to get the list of values currently stored, but we cannot manipulate d as a list	train
audio_0_221397.wav	So, as we get more and more messy grids, this combinatorial question becomes more and more complicated to solve this way	train
audio_0_32665.wav	You get minus pi epsilon	train
audio_0_50691.wav	this is the current in this ring and therefore that small delta b, due to this, is going to be mu zero over two sigma r delta r times r square over r square plus z square, raise to three by two, and total b, which is in the z direction at height	train

audio_0_84185.wav	Yes, this is sine wave, all right	train
audio_0_66509.wav	Second important part about this is that if you take a very big one then its movement will be an issue, will be always an issue	train
audio_0_172716.wav	A course is also tagged with the POs, PSOs it addresses, cognitive levels, knowledge categories of all its COs and classroom or tutorial or laboratory sessions that are associated with that	train
audio_0_188501.wav	So, differentiating f of x and setting the differential to 0 results in the fol lowing equation, and this can be simplified to this equation, where a transpose a times x is a transpose b	train
audio_0_152057.wav	Content by new users do not grow, right	train
audio_0_5578.wav	And one thing is there look whenever we are drawing circuit, if I show arrow upward I mean arrow like these and arrow is always plus and nothing is mark means this is minus right this way you have to assume	train
audio_0_211705.wav	so it has to profile the whole system and a complete profile of the incubator has to be obtained and you are measuring ambient	train
audio_0_19349.wav	So, the benefit from B is lost	train
audio_0_13326.wav	And similarly for ramp function r t is equal to minus infinity to t u t d t right	train
audio_0_19242.wav	We have got four types of fruits and we make four types of pulps	train
audio_0_105187.wav	Now this the overload two is called where the second argument is a double and the overload three is also possible where the first argument is the double and depending on that, it gets resolved and now since it is a friend function it can access the internals of the complex class and actually it is possible to implement them even though the parameters re and I m are private members	train
audio_0_183264.wav	So, here we have a slope that is more negative than minus 2 or a path loss exponent that is greater than 2	train
audio_0_18372.wav	Suppose, this numerator angle theta 1 minus 3, but if it is denominator if you want, then it will be 2 by 5	train
audio_0_151587.wav	To create a twitter application go to apps	train
audio_0_182659.wav	So, basically this is resolved into two components r naught plus v times t and cosine 2 pi fc t basically if you substitute for r in terms of r naught plus v t, we showed that you get this expression that clearly shows the introduction of Doppler shift into the system	train
audio_0_67507.wav	So, you become a pi or you get a job in the industry and you have to set up a cell culture facility	train
audio_0_100114.wav	So, this is basically that the story of casting between classes when we introduce C++	train

audio_0_148907.wav	Observed to change 5 time or more	train
audio_0_60898.wav	let say i have a polysilicon block here, another polysilicon block here and i have a diffusion block here	train
audio_0_97007.wav	The difference with the previous form is specifically need to put the array operator after the delete key word and before the pointer	train
audio_0_18954.wav	So, tau is equal to C R Thevenin, you can easily compute, right	train
audio_0_42414.wav	Any other any creative solutions from here	train
audio_0_20108.wav	It is 153	train
audio_0_85055.wav	Now, VGS is greater than 0; that means, inversion is there conductive channels forms between source and drain right this is conductive channel is formed between source and drain as you can see	train
audio_0_105222.wav	So the only difficulty in this solution is it breaks the encapsulation, as we pretty much know by now that any overloading with global function will break the encapsulation	train
audio_0_119965.wav	close that close tell if we open the same project later	train
audio_0_77266.wav	Were cells actually degrade the basement membrane and that represents that degradation of the basement membrane represents the first step in invasion, in initiating the invasion metastasis cascade	train
audio_0_23.wav	And obviously, if you one hand allow low manufacturing cost, it means that you do not have µch control on the noise factor at that the particular levels	train
audio_0_64138.wav	i have a path to take from here to here or here to here, right	train
audio_0_233994.wav	So, how will you assess this	train
audio_0_204687.wav	When we are looking from top view this entire plane will be visible	train
audio_0_55441.wav	so i have shown the channel intersection graph model	train
audio_0_25989.wav	Now, you can combine these two things in interesting ways	train
audio_0_236221.wav	Now, let us see, there are two options here	train
audio_0_127183.wav	i have a voltage source here and i have this one kilo ohm resistor, the current through one kilo ohm resistor, i x, and this current controlled voltage source is one kilo ohm times i x	train
audio_0_229240.wav	I will take them one by one and try to pick some data and try to plot these in excel and try to explain you that how do we use these specific kind of data	train
audio_0_74864.wav	So, just to recall what is invadopodia	train
audio_0_143740.wav	Of course, we will not be able to go into details of industry or economy analysis, but we would try to look at how to do company analysis mainly based on the ratios	train
audio_0_213813.wav	ah, ok, so that might be one way of ah, of, let us say, using still continuity, use r s s i for the purpose of localization	train
audio_0_70246.wav	About 50 years back, the only type of software projects that were existing were software product development type of projects	train
audio_0_125150.wav	ok, so once you recognized that is positive, you know that a has to be the inverting terminal and b is the non inverting terminal	train
audio_0_173376.wav	The difference is National or the NAAC wants only the institutional accreditation while they look at some programs in detail, but they want a whole bunch of other characteristics of the institute to be reviewed and evaluated	train
audio_0_219920.wav	So, we start at any of these vertices, evaluate the objective function, then we look at the neighboring vertices	train
audio_0_160075.wav	So you can define this entire structure, the tree structure	train
audio_0_60987.wav	ok, so now your height becomes ah, eight, two, one, two, one and two	train
audio_0_111104.wav	Welcome to the last lecture of this course	train
audio_0_150977.wav	That just shows, so basically this graph on this graph, the slide 11 and slide 12 is basically showing you the change in information in the account	train
audio_0_218058.wav	again, let us go back to our basic ah	train
audio_0_219520.wav	Likely, likewise b is empty and u is not, it is n minus i plus 1, we have to insert all those like this	train
audio_0_80960.wav	So, have a duration we have seen power dissipation temperature range ok	train
audio_0_132181.wav	so let us go to this slide	train
audio_0_27770.wav	So, again we may have to shift it down one value and then another value	train
audio_0_103583.wav	Now when I do this I say that I am overriding the earlier function, because the moment I put this I am talking about two functions, this functions is b colon colon f and this function is d colon colon f	train
audio_0_162637.wav	So, for that you need to point it to the thing, actually generally it is pointed to the zenith because that is 5 degree Kelvin almost 0 degree Kelvin you can say	train
audio_0_62814.wav	ok, the first sentence is important	train
audio_0_10041.wav	72 and Z L will become 2	train
audio_0_139193.wav	So in that sense it is a set point for controlled, for the flow rate of the control stream	train
audio_0_225625.wav	So, initially we are n vertices n components, the most natural thing to do, is to say, that each vertex i belongs to a components part i	train
audio_0_165292.wav	So what will happen, that you have assume alpha and omega naught and based on that you can again have the three possible solutions, so if you compare similar to your series RLC circuit in this case also you will get three possible solutions, the conditions for this possible solutions would be one condition is alpha greater than omega naught, second is alpha equal to omega naughtand third is alpha less than omega naught	train
audio_0_42153.wav	So, how do I get the tangential field I mean, how do I get the magnetic field	train
audio_0_71438.wav	So this outlay of cash for a specific item or activity is called as tangible cost so examples of tangible cost are what purchase of machinery is purchase of devices such as purchase of hardware or different software the cost required for training the personnel the cost required for paying salaries the employees these are examples of tangible costs similarly what do you mean by intangible costs so tangible cost means cost which can be easily what measured which can be easily which can be easily measured but intangible cost means cost that are known to exist but with financial value cannot be accurately measured	train
audio_0_187189.wav	So, in that sense also linear algebra is an important com ponent of data science	train
audio_0_191075.wav	So, the most important examples of ideals are the kernels of ring homomorphisms ok	train
audio_0_6519.wav	And mu 0 is equal to either 4 pi into 10 to the power minus 7 Weber per ampere meter or it is Henry per meter either this unit or this unit Weber per ampere meter or Henry per meter	train
audio_0_125336.wav	in this case, ok	train
audio_0_239174.wav	But, you tell people that, this is expected of them	train
audio_0_134090.wav	So, when you see these things or when you saw the line that you saw right now to derive an image of what you are looking at you have learned certain things certain things got recollected from your memory and then it did induce a sense of feeling within you	train
audio_0_176712.wav	Coming to Course Outcomes, Course Outcomes are what students are required to attain at the end of a course	train
audio_0_48403.wav	an electric field due to this polarization is given as minus p over two, epsilon zero, and therefore the answer for d is going to be minus p over two, plus p which is equal to p over two	train
audio_0_10591.wav	So, there is a difference of this 2 is your how much 800 micro joule	train
audio_0_134270.wav	Once this following the process of transduction the information comes to the brain, our brain then tries to assign an appropriate meaning to this	train
audio_0_43219.wav	And this simulation is showing you the electric fields on the surface	train
audio_0_86434.wav	Then we would see that the payload is actually present starting from this location	train
audio_0_82095.wav	So, let us see, what is the frequency here connected to frequency, yes; it is a mode of frequency	train
audio_0_231411.wav	Overall handling procrastination enhances your confidence and sense of worth	train
audio_0_220562.wav	There are about ten cities; Delhi, Varanasi, Ahmedabad, down to Trivandrum in the south	train

audio_0_147777.wav	Expand the bottom panel using the up arrow at the bottom, and click on global	train
audio_0_172586.wav	Now comes as per Anderson Bloom they provided 3 aspects	train
audio_0_11393.wav	It does not change with time as the instantaneous power of each phase does	train
audio_0_83730.wav	Now for the value of CMRR; so, there are two values that we need to calculate; first value is given as CMRR equals to 100	train
audio_0_172162.wav	So, this circuit can be can be replaced by the equivalent circuit as shown in the figure and the load Rl is connected across the terminal AB	train
audio_0_215318.wav	one is called ah um, ah, s c l, ok, and s d a	train
audio_0_158014.wav	This is typical times	train
audio_0_88709.wav	So, for example we have privileged code over here could be at Android OS so let us say for example that a network interrupt occurs and a network interrupts are configured to be handle by the normal world	train
audio_0_51099.wav	so let's write it: b induced, that is, the further induced due to this change in electric field	train
audio_0_225234.wav	But, but this is how it would look if I arranged as the heap	train
audio_0_213339.wav	look at the packaging information: q f p package, not q f n	train
audio_0_146162.wav	Whenever the foreground tasks do not exist, the background tasks start running	train
audio_0_20756.wav	So this budget is one of the techniques of cost and management accounting which has a vast applicability and today it has become very popular technique and used in almost all walks of life	train
audio_0_175511.wav	These are six categories	train
audio_0_61203.wav	you see d one, d two, d three, d four or these are flip flops connected as a shift register	train
audio_0_132963.wav	And with the serial communication with the name “pc” that we have already made, we will print the values of the x, y and z coordinate, which is stored in variables x1, y1 and z1	train
audio_0_81822.wav	So, we have to filter out filter out, right	train
audio_0_197239.wav	So, to one of the ports we will feed the input and from another port we take the output	train
audio_0_115114.wav	rather, we try to look at	train
audio_0_43666.wav	In fact, that is a source of a lot of coding mistakes also yeah	train
audio_0_188042.wav	I am squaring the term, and I am summing it	train
audio_0_163688.wav	So, now this a phi dashed I have this unit vector I have expressed	train
audio_0_229243.wav	So, I will first take the variable charts, then I will take the attribute charts to give and broad information that this in this X bar chart monitor what be monitor here is the process mean	train
audio_0_175294.wav	The POs and PSOs are addressed here	train
audio_0_189521.wav	I have the sensitivity value which is equal to one	train

audio_0_173347.wav	We explore these words and this concept in the following module	train
audio_0_37614.wav	So, this is going to be at node 1 minus node 2 that is what it is going to be	train
audio_0_206088.wav	Similarly, this part goes all the way there, then there is a horizontal line; this part goes all the way there, and touch that	train
audio_0_183148.wav	Several examples of the FDD system for example: the GSM system that we use in the second generation, the wideband CDMA in the third generation or examples of a frequency division duplex system	train
audio_0_93547.wav	but remember, as long as you are pursuing your education, you are also developing or you are learning certain skills	train
audio_0_46906.wav	So kW you can take it as point four for transformers two winding or three winding transformers and is equal to point six for inductors inductors have just normally single winding and there are no insulation insulation between windings and things like that and therefore you can utilize the window area much better	train
audio_0_65315.wav	and there can be other nets which are not so critical like the signal nets	train
audio_0_162370.wav	So, I introduce the vector potential	train
audio_0_228282.wav	So, this is again x z plane	train
audio_0_235692.wav	Identify, what you can learn, to improve your potential, and the skills, that you can add to, what you currently know, and help you in, your larger goal in life	train
audio_0_81338.wav	So, when we see both input and output signals simultaneously, what we observe here is at 5V peak to peak, your input and output voltage remains almost same	train
audio_0_94259.wav	this seating arrangement is actually provided by the people who are conducting this gd	train
audio_0_175702.wav	For example the student uses the learning goals, success criteria and descriptive feedback	train
audio_0_86069.wav	So, whatever canary was there present is now overwritten with 32, 32, 32 and 32	train
audio_0_56290.wav	so my data must be kept stable a minimum time before the clock and also minimum time after the clock	train
audio_0_47045.wav	So let me type G Shem, enter, and you will see a G Y something like this opens up	train
audio_0_33256.wav	So, this is relatively a new thing which we did not study in the case of integral equation methods of finite element methods, and that is coming because now, we are dealing with time explicitly	train
audio_0_185164.wav	So, that is the dimensions that we are going to study	train
audio_0_81895.wav	We can apply plus we can also apply plus 15 minus 15	train
audio_0_26261.wav	This actually comes from a style of programming called functional programming, which, from where this kind of a notation is there, and python has borrowed it and it works quite well	train
audio_0_101191.wav	So, all those reference will have to be constant	train
audio_0_143648.wav	Now, we'll just have a look at the LIFO method	train
audio_0_150692.wav	Here is one which is fake customer service accounts which is, I have a problem I actually post a tweet saying I have problem with this bank	train
audio_0_56046.wav	so what i mean is something like this: let say there is a gate here, say an inverter, there is another gate here	train
audio_0_207734.wav	If that is the case, we see BC line, AD line coincides making an angle 30 degrees in the front view	train
audio_0_92799.wav	So let C be the curve given by this x t yt and zt and in this case, we know already from the chain rule that since f is a function of x, y z and x is again a function of t, and y is a function of t and z is a function of t	train
audio_0_2850.wav	So, it i[s] this side frequency is F this is a frequency this is a simple trick right	train
audio_0_5245.wav	So, this is how calculate now another thing is	train
audio_0_176112.wav	These days of course Wikipedia or Google you will be totally ineffective if some of the numbers are not thoroughly internalized	train
audio_0_1463.wav	This is micanite your vee ring, and this is riser from this commutator where the windings are connected through this riser or lug right	train
audio_0_183416.wav	And again from the power spectral density I know that the channel response must be 0 outside of fd	train
audio_0_202913.wav	If it is something like a spiral you have r theta phi kind of coordinates which can be connected by one single parameter	train
audio_0_27246.wav	So, s is equal to line colon minus 1, will take the line and the strip of the last character which is typically backslash n that we get, when we do readlines	train
audio_0_235634.wav	I do not know, if that will, ever materialize	train
audio_0_198372.wav	Now this you know by experience, you know that all your electronic gadgets work with the battery	train
audio_0_236131.wav	Civil society, again NGO	train
audio_0_232118.wav	It will not let new thoughts to come, it will not accept even if hundreds of videos like this will teach you lessons, will make you work, your mind has to be open and then you receive the ideas, accept your mistake and then move ahead and then you will find that you are starting to live a new life and new avenues, new windows are getting opened	train
audio_0_222639.wav	So, we can again skip over to 4, because 3 has nothing new to tell us	train
audio_0_115856.wav	so, with this ah, let us conclude today, and as we understand, there is a ah, there is a lot of scope of a doing research and for the studies	train
audio_0_8632.wav	254 the power factor	train
audio_0_234427.wav	This is after all external motivation	train
audio_0_229121.wav	Total quality management is the maintaining the quality while you are manufacturing	train
audio_0_52011.wav	So, let me write vector from 1 2 as r 1 2, vector from 2 to 1 as r 2 1, I follow this convention all throughout	train
audio_0_234894.wav	So, that always helps	train
audio_0_187540.wav	So, as I go away from sensitivity, I do not want to lose too much specificity	train
audio_0_2225.wav	So, no current is flowing through the your what you call secondary, but primary side you have applied your small voltage right	train
audio_0_137675.wav	So if I equate them and then what I find is that now if the, now what is the plant, so I said the plant model should be known I'm assuming that the plant is the second order process, over damped, it has two time constants, one is t1 and t2 typically they will be larger than Tc when we control something we want to make its response, generally we have to make its response faster	train
audio_0_100282.wav	I will have a static binding and if I have a virtual function then i will have a dynamic binding where the if I call that function through a pointer then it will not depend on the type of the pointer, but it will depend on the actual object type of the actual object that the pointer points to at the run time	train
audio_0_190898.wav	So, a ring is noetherian if and only if, every ascending chain of ideal; every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes this is useful	train
audio_0_110925.wav	Now; obviously, the calculation for this particular measurement is not so extensive that always you need to do it by Smith Chart, but we encourage always to use Smith Chart because, later you will find that many times in analysis and design things that the network is not	train
audio_0_143637.wav	And since we have a stock of 2,09, 4,900, of which 2000 is purchased on 27, the remaining 2,900 is purchased on 22nd	train
audio_0_34996.wav	In the case of the integral equation method when you write a contour integral on the boundary, that one equation involves all the fields along the contour	train
audio_0_60345.wav	i shall be showing you step by step evaluation	train
audio_0_231365.wav	Now, instead of completing that assignment, somebody is calling you for a movie	train
audio_0_142966.wav	But that cannot be shown in the balance sheet because look at the definition	train
audio_0_221883.wav	So, this is my A, this is my B and this is my C	train
audio_0_187564.wav	So, in general, if the area under the curve is between 0	train
audio_0_61252.wav	there are comprehensive lists of this primitive polynomials available in various places	train
audio_0_213594.wav	to avoid collisions, to avoid collisions on the medium access control layer	train
audio_0_61280.wav	but one thing we did not consider, a z is that the paths that we are considering, are they all actual, important to consider, like there may be some paths which may look to be very critical, very long, but what may it happening in practice is that this circuits are such that, because the functionality of the blocks, gates, whatever, that is important, ok	train
audio_0_180503.wav	This one achieves something slightly less, 1 over M summation root gamma k root gamma k whole square and this one basically selects the best of all the antennas : gamma 1 to gamma M, and we also showed that when you take the average value, this achieves M times gamma	train
audio_0_104629.wav	Now, what happens if you try to do this; that you are actually having a reference of the base class object and you are trying to downcast it to the specialized class	train
audio_0_34358.wav	Yeah incident field is known	train
audio_0_203892.wav	If you are seeing, there is something like a slot	train
audio_0_11127.wav	Anyway, so next is instantaneous voltage that is v R plus v L is equal to v	train
audio_0_176359.wav	For example in a given electronic circuit you can say if I change the resistor value to another value what happens	train
audio_0_721.wav	And one additional node is neutral that we will see your n, that we will see later for the AC circuit not here we will not see those things here right	train
audio_0_164736.wav	Now, we need to find the closed loop transfer function matrix so first we will try to find out the value of I plus Gs Hs	train
audio_0_64722.wav	ok, now let us move into some methods which are little more practical in the sense that we have lot more flexibility here	train
audio_0_52670.wav	notice that in nexus equation we assume that divergence of e integrated over surface is equal to q over epsilon zero, which is gauss's law	train
audio_0_163900.wav	So, this is the equation which we get from this particular segment of the circuit	train
audio_0_31623.wav	So, when I want to take the derivative of the product the in vector calculus it becomes divergence right	train
audio_0_133137.wav	And therefore, ego has to now remain in touch with the reality, ego also has to partially make up satisfaction equation it has to derive out of the demands of the id and the super ego, it has to strike a balance	train
audio_0_219152.wav	So, we compute Fibonacci of 4 to be 3 from the recursive definition and there again we store it in the table	train
audio_0_120708.wav	Then off they went with old newspaper in their hands	train
audio_0_172555.wav	You are coming with two statements	train
audio_0_116104.wav	so what we says that this are some of the essential best practices, or some best practices we should keep in mind when formulating the sla, etcetera: link: identify the cloud actors	train
audio_0_159742.wav	So, essentially the update that is done by the first transaction is lost because it has been superseded by some and other transaction	train
audio_0_155445.wav	However, it is also important to realize that the emotional state which is identified with it should be only temporary	train
audio_0_70797.wav	Whereas PMBOK is a documentation of the knowledge	train
audio_0_153936.wav	In any interaction what is the level of our empathy which we have towards the content which is being passed on	train
audio_0_181673.wav	The optimal combining method for diversity gives us the diversity SNR as the sum of the individual SNRs K is equal to 1 through M gamma K	train
audio_0_34648.wav	So, steps are clear	train
audio_0_203347.wav	So, first example what we are practicing is 2D sketches or part drawing we would like to go with	train
audio_0_58118.wav	so lets look into it	train
audio_0_155194.wav	We can start by changing a smaller aspects related with our body language for example, we may want to change the position of legs well while we sit in our workplace or we want not to use a particular hand gesture or we may like to remember to have more smiles or maintain a better eye contact in our conversation	train
audio_0_156953.wav	So what it essentially means is that the functional dependencies and the keys can normalize the relation only up to a certain extent	train
audio_0_222387.wav	Now, for each vertex, we have to scan all its neighbors	train
audio_0_208192.wav	The first step what we have to follow is draw an XY line	train

audio_0_71079.wav	Well, here see a taxonomy of the various estimating methods	train
audio_0_28783.wav	So, when we did it by brute force we had an order m n square algorithm	train
audio_0_174239.wav	So it is not a does not represent the product of learning	train
audio_0_223528.wav	So, if I look at here for example, the bottom neighbors not, if I look here the neighbors not	train
audio_0_121209.wav	And they are focused so entirely on this game that sometimes they even forget to eat	train
audio_0_36146.wav	And, this also tells you that if I wanted to simulate and solve for a real life very complicated aircraft or ship or something, integral equation methods they are just impossible to work with because they take so, much time order n cube versus order n	train
audio_0_40188.wav	So this module is going to be about the method of moments which is the name given to the way in which we solve the integral equations	train

audio_0_135367.wav	And now big theories can be retrieved using a those cues	train
audio_0_236135.wav	And, that puts up a lot of pressure on us, to do things, the way, they need to be done	train
audio_0_119824.wav	so what we see, these iot cloud platform is going to be a enabling technology for our or several futuristic ah applications	train
audio_0_93373.wav	again look at the second sentence	train
audio_0_135886.wav	It flows uni directionally almost throughout the novel	train
audio_0_30888.wav	So, it may be looking complicated and ugly, but ever thing inside this is known to me	train
audio_0_226160.wav	So, this is the effective diameter is equal to theoretical dimension of the or the dimension of the wire and P is the correction factor with this	train
audio_0_42543.wav	Right this was our v 2 this is our v 1	train
audio_0_186237.wav	And we will see that here also the minimal error occurs at 2 showing that a quadratic model is probably best for this particular data after which the error actually essentially flattens out	train
audio_0_179004.wav	Now the key information is now what happens if we move from CSIR to CSIT	train

audio_0_237854.wav	Everything may be, okay	train
audio_0_32048.wav	So, again this is a new concept	train
audio_0_216633.wav	the system automatically shuts down because the supercapacitor would have depleted significantly below its normal offering of stable output voltage, pulling down p good again, and the system actually goes back to a cold start situation	train
audio_0_176321.wav	That means the procedure is asked or you have to remember certain sets of formulae and then put that and implement	train
audio_0_184374.wav	So, basically there is going to be dynamic pricing just like stocks everybody is going to be putting up their prices and then you optimize and say that I am going to take it at this time	train
audio_0_1698.wav	This is a first equation for mesh 1	train
audio_0_13011.wav	Now, consider one example using source transformation you determine v 0 in the circuit for I mean I mean this is your this is your v 0	train

audio_0_134283.wav	So, we would try to also see not only the major theories that tries to explain emotion, but also how emotion and understanding of emotion has grown and become wider and wider helping us understand how we feel, what we feel, and why do we feel what exactly we feel	train
audio_0_239694.wav	And, people should not feel scared to perform	train
audio_0_226897.wav	So, same way if you see that it is cathode, anode this is anode, this is cathode and then you have a grid	train
audio_0_185763.wav	So, let us say if dn is the smallest distance, so dn maybe d 5, d 3, d 10, whatever it is, so I order them	train
audio_0_219543.wav	Otherwise, I take the minimum of the subproblems and add 1 for the current changes and finally, I have returned the value 0 and 0	train
audio_0_101680.wav	And there are several design techniques by which you can make what is known as a double dispatch like jointly you can a decide on two independent hierarchies and actually dispatch a polymorphic function that will be beyond the scope of this course as you become more and more expert, you will able to learnt and see all that	train
audio_0_155166.wav	And therefore, it is important to learn positive body language and control the negative aspects associated with it	train
audio_0_188106.wav	And another important thing one has to do is, for this knn implementation, we need two external packages which are caret and class, one has to install this caret and class packages if they have not installed it already	train
audio_0_94764.wav	and if you are doing some responsibilities, ah, some accomplishments, presently, use it in the present	train

audio_0_61782.wav	so if you again, similarly as i said earlier, try to discretize it in terms of square boxes, each of this square will be point three, two micron	train
audio_0_60071.wav	straight line can be represented by the n coordinates to coordinates means the straight line	train
audio_0_115275.wav	so what it is trying to do, so it it tries to cluster ah using, say, came in ah cluster k means cluster to automatically determine these, what is this workload means of the different user ah and then to predict that, what are the what	train
audio_0_173071.wav	Now if you look at the activities involved in addressing this PO if you take the keywords, first is identify, problem identification	train
audio_0_203989.wav	So, we can see this is fixed in the center and it is in the middle of this plane and this particular plane	train
audio_0_144114.wav	Sometimes those are called as debit or credit because of two effects the balance sheet always tally	train
audio_0_189717.wav	You figure out by trying on your own	train
audio_0_57187.wav	so you see, this tree looks like be less spread as compared to this	train
audio_0_73618.wav	Now this let's see the algorithm models or now let us see this this algorithm models or parameter models	train
audio_0_45227.wav	The non dot end becomes positive, dot end becomes negative, non dot end becomes positive, dot end becomes negative, and this will keep rising till it forward bias the diode and freewheels in this fashion	train
audio_0_182752.wav	And we showed that 4 d minus r is basically related to again going back to the earlier expression, it is related to the time difference between the two paths	train
audio_0_223851.wav	Of course, there is only one auditorium, so two people cannot use it at the same time	train
audio_0_101366.wav	So, now, the parameter becomes purely an input parameter	train
audio_0_67982.wav	So, primary cultures are essentially when for culturing you directly derive the tissue from live animal, you have to kill animal or if the tissue is just take a small part of the skin then you can you know give the animal necessary first aid and you know and exercise the animal, take the tissue and you know give the animal necessary first aid and you know good to go or you want to sacrifice the animal	train
audio_0_6836.wav	So, it is also small it is almost 0 will neglect it, right	train
audio_0_220446.wav	Now, I have to add the remaining n minus 1 edges to my tree	train
audio_0_67377.wav	so what you have is nice pyramidal neurons growing out on the culture dish, something like this: ok	train
audio_0_203504.wav	Now, other dimensions I would like to use	train
audio_0_181245.wav	Exactly that’s correct	train
audio_0_142919.wav	Or we have shares in invests in but 2 month those shares are going to be a current investment	train
audio_0_102462.wav	With this, in this part of the recap, we have primarily talked of the different derived types	train
audio_0_77692.wav	Today we will discuss another disease again marked by fibrosis which is called Atherosclerosis	train
audio_0_50167.wav	so the current should be such that it opposes the rod end	train
audio_0_168673.wav	So these two are the same equations which we represented initially to define the h parameters	train
audio_0_118737.wav	right, so we have two approaches	train
audio_0_154350.wav	Sometimes we find that a compulsory touch is there, because it is the demand of the profession, a doctor has to touch the patient we can help somebody out of the car	train
audio_0_197760.wav	Or in other words, another way of saying that is to make sure that the time constant is much more than the reciprocal of the frequency	train
audio_0_173221.wav	The unit is we are trying to look at the words education and teaching	train
audio_0_140506.wav	One method again of inverse response compensation, so this is what we are setting out to learn today, so let us first look at the causes of time delay	train
audio_0_188971.wav	However you try to draw a line it would be very difficult ,almost impossible in this case, to classify these 2 classes with just a line in this 2 D picture	train
audio_0_341.wav	So, second thing is the flux density b should B is equal to phi upon small a right and your A is the number of parallel path right	train
audio_0_173123.wav	So these are some possible activities but these activities are not merely textbook type nor just come into the purview of a what do you call our present method of examination	train
audio_0_13137.wav	And this is 4 ampere this part of the circuit keeps it as it is right	train
audio_0_176223.wav	We will elaborate these two domains a little more in other units and coming to Cognitive Domain	train
audio_0_194395.wav	So, we get b is equal to b x plus a b r right b times 1 is b, b x plus b a r, this the distributivity of addition and multiplication	train
audio_0_105886.wav	It can bring in revenue by which it can fund further research, so that is another model and we have seen this effective in some universities in the United States, where the money that is generated from commercializing research is pulled back into the university for further research and it could also set the culture for research in an university for instance, there are studies which indicate that if a university takes transfer of technology seriously, then it becomes much better for them to identify hire and retain talent	train
audio_0_224985.wav	And finally, if we have a node with two children, what we do is if we first compute the predecessor at v and then we set the current nodes value to be the predecessor value and now we know that this value is duplicate	train
audio_0_234840.wav	And then, we move on to separation	train
audio_0_193275.wav	So, certainly no prime divides the coefficients	train
audio_0_173608.wav	That means there are many academic decisions or in terms of assessment they are centrally controlled	train
audio_0_161620.wav	So, this only works for serial transactions	train
audio_0_134985.wav	Tip of tongue phenomenon basically means that when we store the information and try to recollect it re failed to do	train
audio_0_100195.wav	Now, let say we have done an up cast	train
audio_0_205083.wav	So, you supposed to make 60 degrees somewhere there so join these lines	train
audio_0_2897.wav	It will be for motor it will be always positive right	train
audio_0_23625.wav	It’s been over 4 weeks that you have been listening to these lectures online and finding out more about design thinking	train
audio_0_216322.wav	so for that ah, we can share several	train
audio_0_206278.wav	So, that we are going to construct flip plane as that the yellow one or the mustard color	train
audio_0_64446.wav	so here we are abstracting these faults as a fault in the if, then eslse construct or as a switch construct	train
audio_0_216475.wav	how do you evaluate that	train
audio_0_73909.wav	So, in cells which are we cleared here in for example, the in immune cells which are continuously migrating, these adhesions are much less well developed and are much smaller in size	train
audio_0_237310.wav	But still, these performance appraisals, need to be able to measure, the behavior of employees	train
audio_0_212850.wav	ok, solar panel is the simplest thing that you can think of now	train
audio_0_228426.wav	So, it goes like this as we discussed true value conventional true value is obtained the measurement results	train
audio_0_176778.wav	So in case of government hospitals where the services services are provided almost free they do not look too much after the physical evidence many times the buildings are not well look after the plaster is falling the pipes are dripping the taps are not working etc but in for a private hospital these are very important factors and the hospital has to keep the buildings pathology labs pharmacy center etc in a spikanspan manner then comes the seven piece of the hospital services marketing there is the process so there are two types of processes in hospitals one is for outpatient and another is for inpatient for outpatient the process and the processes are meeting the doctor diagnosis treatment and medication whereas inpatient services there is for patient arrival registration diagnosis treatment future action related suggestions and discharge and payment	train
audio_0_38817.wav	So, what is that basically mean	train
audio_0_228128.wav	So, this is the controller, this is the controller that is used to switch on and off the compressor, ok	train
audio_0_118676.wav	but if we see that, ah, the cloud, it is still fifty three point two, five right now	train
audio_0_155539.wav	You could ask your opinion about someone and they might show disgust	train
audio_0_150110.wav	So, if you look at the error message carefully, it says that you should use this nltk dot download function to download the resources that are required to perform this operation	train
audio_0_171241.wav	Similarly Ib will be lagging by 30 degree from Ibc and Ic will be lagging 30 degree from Ica	train
audio_0_58615.wav	this you can call as the frequency of switching sw	train
audio_0_123732.wav	Now, let say I do this and break this here, and connect it to a current controlled voltage source	train
audio_0_158765.wav	So we can put this down as actually in the following manner is that every cascadless schedule is necessarily recoverable is recoverable	train
audio_0_226955.wav	So, this bezel can be used to adjust the 0, we see we can move it if there is arrow, so, if there is 0 error we can adjust it	train
audio_0_178187.wav	So, the LNA is very very crucial in our design maybe a simple example will give us a way to appreciate that	train
audio_0_60010.wav	so if i see i moving in the right direction, i can continually label the adjacent cell: zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero in ah in a single step itself	train
audio_0_36756.wav	So, this becomes more and more accurate because waves will more or less begin to reach normally think of a very large circle right whatever reaches that will reach only normally assuming a finite object	train
audio_0_26645.wav	So, we need to compute the right side	train
audio_0_96220.wav	so now, when a when a memo comes, of course, though at times it appears it is threatening, but you would like to know	train
audio_0_63049.wav	so this is the hierarchical description of how we have created this structural description, the four bit adder	train

audio_0_224922.wav	So, is like insertion in a shorted list, except we have to find that correct place in the tree to hang it	train
audio_0_194658.wav	We had called this R1 there, now we call it RS	train
audio_0_175339.wav	That is the reason why this will also kind of come down	train
audio_0_219719.wav	So, we do DFS of j, once for every j	train
audio_0_75398.wav	So, after doing this you let it air dry ok	train
audio_0_206997.wav	If one would like to draw an inclined line with mini drafter, one will one will keep the set square there and draw a line in that direction	train
audio_0_61593.wav	now the exact shapes and size of the blocks has been defined and also we have to keep some extra space for routing	train
audio_0_203387.wav	Now, the units you can always pick it	train
audio_0_203667.wav	So, a pyramid is a pentagonal pyramid	train
audio_0_94111.wav	so johari window actually functions to illustrate and improve self awareness and mutual understanding	train
audio_0_155363.wav	We know that there are certain types of touches which can be used appropriately in the workplace, for example, an encouraging pat on the back a handshake but at the same time there may be an unwanted touch or a touch which is deliberately intimidating which is not only unprofessional, but can also be criminal	train
audio_0_193203.wav	So, it can be written as a product of two non units	train
audio_0_36539.wav	So, here you can see whether one of the l got cancelled off, so that is why this is 2 l by pi squared 1 by n squared was still there I have a sine n pi x by l and a sine n pi x prime by l both terms are over here ok	train
audio_0_164592.wav	So balanced source is behind the particular nodes, which we are seeing so we are not showing that in the figure but since our objective is to analyze the circuit by assuming unbalanced load	train
audio_0_82829.wav	So now, we go to 90 hertz, and I see it is still not allowing to pass	train
audio_0_190468.wav	So, a plus is of course, identity elements is there it is 1	train
audio_0_2043.wav	So, V a n if you got 10 degree, and with respect to that if you draw the reference V b n in 110 degree, because it is your what we call sorry V c n is given 110 degree, and V b n is minus 230 degree	train
audio_0_3277.wav	Similarly V ab upon V ca if you make, you will get V L angle 30, while V L angle minus 210 degree, you will get V ca is equal to V ab angle minus 250 40 degree or you add 360 with that other way V ca is equal to V ab angle 120 degree right, this is the relationship	train
audio_0_39415.wav	So, the spacing your h is actually just equal to 1	train
audio_0_163657.wav	So, the loop axis is in the Z axis	train
audio_0_212360.wav	you must have come across many, many of these, ah, you know, off the shelf boards which are available	train
audio_0_42577.wav	So, how is it	train
audio_0_218278.wav	yeah, i think the right word indeed is efficiency is	train
audio_0_171678.wav	And now using this value you can simply calculate the value of voltage drop across the the element	train
audio_0_184546.wav	Because I cannot create nulls in my transmitted spectrum, because my it is a single carrier system	train
audio_0_112345.wav	Now, you know that this is your earlier knowledge that ABCD parameters are defined as the port 1 quantities port 1 voltage and current V 1 and I 1 total that is related to V 2 and I 2	train
audio_0_72984.wav	In the developing long term projects, it is very much difficult to compare what is the today's cost with the full value of tomorrow's benefits	train
audio_0_118246.wav	the user logs in horizon and initiates the v m creation	train
audio_0_38901.wav	So, when I take the gradient only the x dependent terms are this guy and non linear means over here U is a function of x	train
audio_0_29143.wav	But here I want to do nothing, I want to recognize there is a value error and then go back here that is fine, but I do not want to do anything else	train
audio_0_216191.wav	you can either do it for apple hand phones or for android based development systems and um, use this server server site for notifications	train
audio_0_219394.wav	Assuming that the fire travels at a uniform speed, it will reach the shortest, the closest vertex first	train
audio_0_3036.wav	Now, now the energy dissipated per cycle in the circuit of figure 1 and figure 2 is given by the product of the average power of the resistor and a your what you call that is your Irms square r and the period T or 1 f; that means, that means this is we are writing I your what we call I max by root 2	train
audio_0_62225.wav	so let us look into this methods one by one	train
audio_0_102003.wav	And, the destructor for this static object c happens, after main returns, which is a, which is matching, befitting with the LIFO strategy that the order of destruction has to be reverse of the order of the construction	train
audio_0_4747.wav	From here, you will get i is equal to 16 minus V Thevenin divided by 2	train
audio_0_28183.wav	So, either we will declare it global in which case we can update it within g or h or it will use the same rule as before if we do not update an immutable value it will look outside and if it is a mutable value it will allow us to update it from inside	train
audio_0_32690.wav	So, let us use the correct expression of here	train
audio_0_71413.wav	So they cannot be clearly defined, they cannot be clearly measured	train
audio_0_42513.wav	So, using del squared g of rr prime plus k naught squared g of rr prime we get	train
audio_0_51812.wav	there is j conduction, but also here there is no conduction currents, so that is why that is ignored	train
audio_0_199161.wav	This is equal to 0	train
audio_0_226613.wav	So, it is typically used by relationship between variable is known but the data is spares data is small	train
audio_0_217328.wav	rectal probe is actually used in most of the hospitals for exact measurement of core body temperature of the human being	train
audio_0_75559.wav	Hello and welcome to our 17th lecture of NPTEL course introduction to mechanobiology	train
audio_0_20880.wav	Those are called as cost budgets	train
audio_0_217640.wav	so you may also have to look at situations where this loop gain lowers	train
audio_0_13261.wav	Since, delta t minus t 0 is equal to 0, except at t is equal to t 0 because at t is equal to t 0 it is undefined you just saw, right	train
audio_0_185375.wav	But it is one of those things where only if you go through that that is why I felt it was important that we should take the time to derive it	train
audio_0_80239.wav	So, that is why you will see that even you come to 115 ah, 118 you can still see that voltage is decreasing	train
audio_0_188807.wav	Now, I am going to use one notation here so, that we can understand the table in the next line	train
audio_0_24825.wav	Here she is very happy	train
audio_0_47890.wav	we want to focus on this because this gives you a relationship between of field which is generated due to change in magnetic fields, of field which is due to is generated is the electric field due to change in magnetic field	train
audio_0_155190.wav	Certain other steps include mirroring for example, is studying the poster of other people, looking at the micro expressions of other people and then certainly mimicking them	train
audio_0_60024.wav	so in the first step you are labeling like this detour number zero	train
audio_0_224596.wav	And in this way you can actually take the recursive algorithm that we wrote before and convert it into an iterative algorithm	train
audio_0_172975.wav	And three POs mention complex engineering problems	train
audio_0_186053.wav	But in that data frame what I want to extract is a subset where the name has to be Senthil or the blood sugar value has to be greater than 150	train
audio_0_16017.wav	Therefore, reluctance for path 1, R 1 is equal to L 1 upon A mu 0 mu r mu r is given right and A is also known	train
audio_0_229241.wav	If, it is available in that specific form and plot this charts	train
audio_0_221478.wav	So, the number of paths, which are coming to this point could not come from there	train
audio_0_15874.wav	So, is substitute you will get this is the value of R 1 26000 not 26000 it is your what you call 261113	train
audio_0_41704.wav	So, you will higher powers of x you will get, but the point is that you cannot ignore the first term; the first term will always be there right	train
audio_0_118663.wav	same thing for cloud, equal to fifty two point five, and it has only one management, so it is fifty three point five	train
audio_0_84488.wav	Llike I said, it is very difficult to understand what is within the IC, right	train
audio_0_57178.wav	but in between it's a tradeoff	train
audio_0_104846.wav	So, the idea is I would like to call the DrawFuncion	train
audio_0_173752.wav	Now once again to reinstate the three elements of a course are Course Outcomes, representing what the student should be able to do at the end of a course	train
audio_0_49994.wav	because i also know that a can be written a as	train
audio_0_178622.wav	So, this we said was a chi square distribution, chi square distribution	train
audio_0_39516.wav	So, this guy can be taken out over here	train
audio_0_185031.wav	And it is a very interesting concept	train
audio_0_153529.wav	In the fast changing pace of our work cultures where we may have to work with people from different cultural background, our awareness of how time is perceived differently in different cultures has become almost a must	train
audio_0_228883.wav	I not need to put my process, here process is percent defective	train
audio_0_112448.wav	Now, for let us do that the previous formula we derived for the S parameter that was from conversion from ABCD parameter	train
audio_0_173229.wav	The other requirements we may broadly classify them as professional requirements and whereas the sound knowledge of engineering sciences and technology is the disciplinary requirements	train
audio_0_141661.wav	Work in progress, there is a small work in progress	train
audio_0_32874.wav	So, if I put c is equal to omega by k r I am done, I get 0 reflection coefficient, but if I have a lossy that is k i not equal to 0, there is no hope	train
audio_0_168939.wav	We continue this journey in the next lecture where we will discuss few more concepts related to rc circuits	train
audio_0_54138.wav	so can i think, if i am thinking of this, this ah charge distribution giving rise to this field all around it, can i think of this energy as if it has been stored in this electric field	train
audio_0_219818.wav	Now, this is a mathematical fact about graph	train
audio_0_240172.wav	Assessing, current employees training needs, is another aspect of needs analysis	train
audio_0_59371.wav	ok, determining area is not difficult because you see your total silicon floor is rectangular in nature	train
audio_0_71000.wav	The software lifecycle as we had already said is a series of stages during the development of the software	train
audio_0_29787.wav	So, anger is one of the complex emotion, aggression is the motor act of it probably verbal or motor act and rage is the basic phenomena	train
audio_0_113740.wav	Because it is a time function that waves are coming and going	train
audio_0_186903.wav	So, you simply substitute them into this expression	train
audio_0_34887.wav	So, if the near field what we can say is that, k r is much much less than 1	train
audio_0_131807.wav	again, i like to stress upon that: steady state and steady flow	train
audio_0_153217.wav	We can say that the body language alerts us to the possibilities of reading an individual in the same manner in which we can read a book and decipher its meaning	train
audio_0_20580.wav	Suppose you have got license on lump sum or if you have purchased a license, it becomes fixed cost	train
audio_0_6330.wav	And therefore, your power across the load R L p L is equal to i L square R L	train
audio_0_64656.wav	and the point to note is that when you have a large system, usually the total circuit is divided across a number of printed circuit boards, whereby we get the system	train
audio_0_13935.wav	Now, next another example, this example is that you have a that you have a 231 whenever nothing is mentioned; that means, 231 Volt means it is RMS value and all the time we assume it is angle say unless and until it is specified say 231 angle, 0 degree right and another thing is the load is given 0	train
audio_0_48716.wav	let's say there's a wave that meets here and then on the other side a same wave, let's say, goes like this: what happens now	train
audio_0_100886.wav	The compiler is providing that and the only difference is since no copy constructor is given by us, there is no explicit message saying that the copy is being constructed, but otherwise if you look at the output, it is exactly the same	train
audio_0_148860.wav	Many participants canceled the posts, because, I think it is because if the posts are negative, and many people are going to be actually offended by the post within your network or in public, it is actually going to be bad for you	train
audio_0_57957.wav	not only that, we also specify some cost function, some objective function that is to optimize, and we give it to an ilp solver	train
audio_0_184502.wav	No because the that is the channel gain	train
audio_0_80507.wav	So, we will start with input bias current we will go to another characteristics in a short while	train
audio_0_153657.wav	Are you sure	train
audio_0_68004.wav	So the way skeletal muscle grows is why I told you that why you cannot take the direct tissue, you only have to rely on the satellite cells to grow them	train
audio_0_131191.wav	it would mean that there will be some variation in temperature and at the surface at most it will be lower	train
audio_0_213976.wav	the quiescent current is typically in micro amps, clearly indicating that for the regulator to provide regulation and provide all the features that we said previously, the features, the requirements that we said, are: it should be stable, it should give you stable output, constant noise, free, accurate, independent of any load voltage fluctuations	train
audio_0_190397.wav	So, what we have is that K over L, so I will write it here K over L over F, suppose that K over L and L over F are algebraic show that K over F is algebraic, ok	train
audio_0_87769.wav	So this is the particular python script, you could actually go through it to see how these gadgets are arranged and eventually the file that gets created, this file called input vm	train
audio_0_40961.wav	I mean you have your circuit impedance as let us say 50 Ohms, 75 Ohms and then you have to match it over there you yeah you cannot match free space	train
audio_0_120354.wav	We can see why Madov and Gizu have these really abnormal psyches	train
audio_0_63621.wav	there are two flip flops	train
audio_0_233827.wav	But anything that involves, the use of more than one sense, in terms of, the person being able to see, what is going on the computer screen, and also being able to hear, and maybe even be able to engage, in some sort of activity	train
audio_0_147608.wav	The appearance tab on the top left lets you change the node edge color and size based on categorical and continuous attributes	train
audio_0_119711.wav	so we like to see that ah, this iot cloud, that is, ah amalgamation of this cloud technology or cloud philosophy with this iot ah, how we it is likely to help the overall performance of this, this services of internet of things or cloud services	train
audio_0_146578.wav	Now let's see what are the solutions for the priority inversion and multiple priority inversions	train
audio_0_103097.wav	Inlining helps to get the benefit of macro to a good extent, while it protects the basic properties and the types of functions	train

audio_0_203457.wav	Now, I would like to draw a rectangle on this plane	train
audio_0_224529.wav	So, it is not the merge step after the recurrence, but the partitioning step before the recurrence	train
audio_0_100320.wav	So, before I can do this, I have to free up, otherwise the resource will leak, memory will leak	train
audio_0_40894.wav	So, here is where these two worlds will meet and this is your antenna right	train
audio_0_184627.wav	It is a very interesting concept, it is channel inversion	train
audio_0_119322.wav	ok, so let us look at it	train
audio_0_60650.wav	so the way we are designing it is that we are dividing that into two memory modules, each of them of size one twenty eight by thirty two and one twenty eight by thirty two	train
audio_0_176647.wav	Facilitates curriculum evaluation which is also is a requirement from NBA	train
audio_0_36350.wav	There are versions of this which you can use for quantum mechanics also	train
audio_0_235171.wav	And, you need to help employees	train
audio_0_167860.wav	If you have circuit with all independent sources set equal to zero and the keeping all the dependent sources connected with the network the terminal a and b would be supplied with voltage v naught which will supply some current i naught	train
audio_0_45870.wav	So if I plot the inductor current it will flow all along through like this so therefore it may be a good idea to plot that also I will do that later so this is actually the secondary current and you see the red one is the demagnotizing current see the it is so small in magnitude so actually the magnetizing part will take a linear wave shape here and goes in an exponential manner and from here again linear and so on	train
audio_0_229728.wav	So, that is nothing, but tolerance I tolerate the variation	train
audio_0_114753.wav	so ah, here they have shown this ah with the experiment that the trial one and two were co resident on distinct physical machine	train
audio_0_173563.wav	Now, what is the actual accreditation process	train
audio_0_151697.wav	In this case, we will print the amount of tweets, which are returned to us by the twitter API	train
audio_0_223659.wav	Therefore, smaller everything else in L, because everything else in L is sorted with respect to this	train
audio_0_99691.wav	So if I do not specify this then it will be taken as that type	train
audio_0_204628.wav	So, we have to construct in such a way that base and axis are inclined and edge also supposed to be inclined	train
audio_0_159787.wav	But so the error that happens is because of trying to enforce the concurrency and this is happening because of something called a deadlock	train
audio_0_237686.wav	Is this beneficial, or is this harmful	train
audio_0_141760.wav	See, I have not added any extra items as the items are there in the actual published balance sheet of Z Entertainment TV are reproduced here	train
audio_0_42910.wav	This expression gets a little bit more complicated when I introduce my phasors right	train
audio_0_95369.wav	in a business world of today, it is actually the relationship that matters, and relationship can be shown, can be insured through the writings that you do for each other, for ones organization, on behalf of organization, and through this ah, through this communication, you can ensure that business runs smoothly	train
audio_0_9671.wav	This is my class note everything it is corrected actually right	train
audio_0_10119.wav	5, I 2 dash 20 magnitude and cos your angle of I 2 dash 36	train

audio_0_26235.wav	It is called filter	train
audio_0_220458.wav	So, this is exactly what Dijkstra's algorithm does except for this update, in this update we add d of u plus the weight of u, right	train
audio_0_223025.wav	So, n by 3 of these symbols will actually be the letter x and now, each of these Xs is going to be represented by it is encoding	train
audio_0_184117.wav	So, we talked about a landline phone connecting to a cell phone	train
audio_0_196176.wav	7 volts and R is 5 kilo ooms, okay, so VD0 turns out to be about 0	train
audio_0_140963.wav	And this state of arousal the reason that you give, that reason determines what emotion will be experienced and therefore it is called cognitive appraisal theory	train
audio_0_151612.wav	For a successful data collection, you need a set of two more keys which is called token actions	train
audio_0_117316.wav	the trust can be overall over all the provider	train
audio_0_181678.wav	And in the last class we also said that we would like to look at a sub optimal method which did not involve the estimation of the noise variances because MRC requires us to have the optimal combining coefficient equal to Z K star divided by sigma n k whole square	train
audio_0_210319.wav	So, where parametric information about curves we will use; that means, there might be a curve, there is another curve, there is another curve, there is another curve	train
audio_0_193568.wav	And what is the absolute value of a plus b times square root minus 5	train
audio_0_210599.wav	Now, on that we have to construct select this one go to insert on top of that curve helix	train
audio_0_188724.wav	However, optimization algorithms will have di erent ways of solving this problem and there are methods called penalty methods, active set methods and so on, we are not going to talk about those methods here	train
audio_0_143226.wav	First May it says two balance brought down	train
audio_0_154085.wav	Eckhard Hess commented that pupil dilates when we are interested in the person we are talking to or the object we are looking at	train

audio_0_74304.wav	So, though amyloid has traditionally been associated with disease causing, but there are functional amyloids also and these amyloid gels have recently been used for differentiating stem cells into neuronal precursor cells	train
audio_0_193191.wav	If f is irreducible in Q X and also primitive, if f is also primitive content of f is; so, we want to now show that f can be f cannot be irreducible in sorry, f has to be irreducible in Z X	train
audio_0_219250.wav	So, certainly at that point this property is true that among the burnt vertices, the distances are in fact the shortest distances	train
audio_0_221691.wav	Is it better to choose shortest processing time, is it better to choose earliest deadline or is there yet another criterion, and how do these criteria justify the choice	train
audio_0_235579.wav	So, there is no dearth of opportunity, of specialized opportunities, of general opportunities	train
audio_0_202969.wav	This is the object we will like to represent it on the drawing sheet	train
audio_0_159135.wav	For every functional dependency X, data means y	train

audio_0_220013.wav	It has n elements up into n components each containing one element	train
audio_0_65256.wav	suppose i have a terminal called point one here, i have terminal point connecting one here and also there is a one here	train
audio_0_29188.wav	Then we saw the command del which takes the value and undefined it	train
audio_0_149557.wav	Similarly, we would define for the next data set	train
audio_0_182313.wav	So, I would like to look at a direct sequence spread spectrum system, and what sort of receiver we would have to use for that	train

audio_0_151272.wav	Valid ambiguity it is not clear, so it says near Taj Mahal or near Govindpuri metro station, so these things are ambiguous	train
audio_0_127070.wav	it can be anything, because i mean, if you differentiate cos you get sine, and if you differentiate sine you get cos	train
audio_0_41163.wav	So, I call I said	train
audio_0_131649.wav	ah, if i tell you in a very crude sense, a heat pipe is actually a cylindrical device, or it can be a flattened cylindrical device, also a flattened circular cross section, i mean, which is an extremely good conductor of heat	train
audio_0_101286.wav	Certainly, it is kinds of a back door to get achieve the result	train
audio_0_93571.wav	now, in order that you are applying, you should actually research about the organization	train
audio_0_220466.wav	So, remember we can start anywhere	train

audio_0_239155.wav	But, this seems to be the one, very popular in the industry	train
audio_0_188883.wav	So, you have to be careful about the conditions when you look at those, but if you stick to this type of writing the equations, where you write minus grad of a sigma lambda grad h i plus sigma mu grad g i and if you write all the constraints as less than equal to inequality constraints, then mus have to be positive for the point to be an optimum point which is what we saw here	train
audio_0_104607.wav	So, by simply checking if p B is null or not you know whether the dynamic cast has gone through or whether actually the pointed object is a b type object or not, so that is a basic value of the dynamic cast	train
audio_0_37059.wav	So, again the notation that will have for time is, we will put it in the superscript right	train
audio_0_9493.wav	And this is constant and this is constant; from 2 to 4 second, it is constant right	train
audio_0_99848.wav	So, you cannot write b search with that so you again make use of the fact that you can use a pointer to int and consider that to be a pointer to void	train

audio_0_36589.wav	So, it we can say that it satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions ok, so three conditions	train
audio_0_47554.wav	So you see all the part of the forward converter exactly same	train
audio_0_8909.wav	So, similarly ah similarly your another thing is that this is 8 volt and here also here also before going to that after that directly I will tell you, right	train
audio_0_148017.wav	This debug message here gives the explanation for this difference	train
audio_0_195916.wav	Obviously, first of all, we already know that the incremental gain from the drain to the source must be negative	train
audio_0_193556.wav	Remember if z is a complex number	train
audio_0_62742.wav	so three, six, three, six together is connected to one by a horizontal line	train
audio_0_101534.wav	But how do you make sure that you can construct only one object, but not more than one object, so that is something which can be done very easily using the static data member and the static member function	train
audio_0_230625.wav	So, the answer is going to be 0	train
audio_0_117400.wav	so the if there is ah a, some sort of a ah degraded ah qos has been ah done using a gaussian distribution and comparison made with conventional minimum cost crisp broker	train
audio_0_31708.wav	So, phi I became that current term this minus this term over here has appeared over here ok, what is left was this final term over here right	train
audio_0_85766.wav	With this we have actually seen how one process could influence the execution time of other process	train
audio_0_230624.wav	05 millimeters, ok	train
audio_0_172516.wav	In that case it will become 2 credit, 2 credits of laboratory	train
audio_0_236754.wav	I have not put it all, here	train
audio_0_72621.wav	It will contain the what the resources they will be required by the project might be the people hardware software and any special resources if any schedule in this content the following so worth item should be there like the you may use work breakdown structure the the what tax network Ghan chart and port chart etc then another what content might be risk management plan how you will handle the risks for that you have to put to what kind of different types of risks what is analysis you have performed how to identify the rigs how to what estimate the impact of the risk how to abandon or mitigate the risks so those things has to be explained in the risk management plan similarly project tracking and control plan how you are tracking the project how you are controlling and monitoring the project the plan regarding that should be discussed here and finally one miscellaneous section should be there in the SPMP mp document which will contain like the process tailoring quality assurance aspects configuration management aspects they will be described in the ARGA in the SPMP document under the heading of miscellaneous plans so now let's see what are the fundamental estimation questions what should be the size of the software that you are going to develop so we have to estimate the estimate the size	train
audio_0_77931.wav	Now let us imagine some scenarios what might happen when the filament polymerizes	train
audio_0_117035.wav	so though it also depends on the what sort of routing algorithms, etcetera also coming into play	train
audio_0_185952.wav	In the one constraint case, we simply said grad f minus grad f equal lambda grad h, in this case this lambda grad h becomes a sum of lambda grad h 1 lambda 1 grad h 1 plus lambda 2 grad has 2 and so on	train
audio_0_4997.wav	If the load is connected to 208 volt, a 208 volt lines, predict the readings of W 1 and W 2 also find P T and Q T right	train
audio_0_47285.wav	That is because there is a body diode present here	train
audio_0_95613.wav	now what are the various sources from which you can have the data	train
audio_0_223340.wav	So, our goal is to show that the algorithm, the solution A produce by our algorithm is actually correct	train
audio_0_190496.wav	Now, write each of them is a rational number, is this a ring	train
audio_0_18167.wav	Now, this voltage is given	train
audio_0_41823.wav	So, the question is that T these 2 functions T a 2 and T b 2 they have a different sign on the edge it will not matter	train
audio_0_112584.wav	55 is here, in previous case or admittance case is here	train
audio_0_119005.wav	so in this case is also for container we can use those ah commands	train
audio_0_84294.wav	And now let me show you the width of this particular oscilloscope,	train
audio_0_40348.wav	So, this is f of x; it can be any kind of a function and what I want is I want to get the normal ok	train
audio_0_41528.wav	Interior fellows will just given identical identically 0 dot product ok	train
audio_0_154366.wav	Gradually with a passage of civilization, it was reduced to a Roman salute where the hand was carried towards the heart	train
audio_0_224117.wav	So, there is no way to break this dichotomy, so we will end up with a situation where we cannot order this set of tasks to respect the constraints	train
audio_0_208101.wav	So, to an ellipse, this is the way we constructed normal; tangent always be 90 degrees and touch at only one point passing through R, and we will be in a position to construct tangent	train
audio_0_98676.wav	We can define aggregations of one or more data members	train
audio_0_190933.wav	So, this function then f n is of course, continuous and it is in I n because it is 0 to the right of n, but f n remember is not in I n minus 1 because if you take n minus 1, it is not 0 on that x axis right, it is not 0 between n minus 1 and n so; that means, that	train
audio_0_38798.wav	So, right; so, what happens is the same framework that we have for the method of moments is what we will use going forward for finite element method question; 2 delta r square where	train
audio_0_155065.wav	And therefore, food is a means of communication which among other things can also convey the status we want to communicate our attitude towards other people by the manner in which we order and we select our food items	train
audio_0_191803.wav	So, now we can write f as e by d and f 0	train
audio_0_42424.wav	Increase the loss gradually the reflection coefficient is greatly reduced ok	train
audio_0_166444.wav	In this approach we assume that output is one volt or maybe one ampere or as appropriate	train
audio_0_132922.wav	and then, if we now somehow are able to maintain this rotating motion of the flywheel and later on use that rotating motion and the kinetic energy due to the rotating motion and connect that to a generator, then we would be able to extract electricity out of it	train
audio_0_221384.wav	I can find out how many paths go from the origin to the given point on the top right provided one path one position is blocked	train
audio_0_168106.wav	The effective value means the value for a periodic current that is equivalent to that the cigarette which delivers the same average power to the resistor as the periodic current does	train
audio_0_172843.wav	So for this test 2 as well and then CIE class average is computed like this	train
audio_0_185400.wav	So, this is the Ideal Fairness	train
audio_0_2.wav	And as we know that you know so far what we have discussed is that the product design is kind of prime activity in the process of realizing a product and therefore, it has a great impact on product quality in fact it has greatest impact you know the design is such that it is a quite robust then it can be able to allow a very less non conformance at the process and the product level	train
audio_0_196817.wav	So this doesn't change the output resistance by much, it reduces it only by a little bit	train
audio_0_190559.wav	I will give you two reasons; one is not in R prime right, because what is the degree of 1; remember 1 is the constant polynomial	train
audio_0_63008.wav	this is cordial ripple carry adder because the carry might ripple through the various stages before it comes out right	train
audio_0_207228.wav	And, this plane what we called horizontal plane	train
audio_0_18177.wav	And now next one is similarly let me clear it, similarly that dv by dt you take that derivative of this one just 1 minute ah that this is vt is given this expression is given 4 e to the power minus t minus 2 you take the derivative of this one right	train
audio_0_194633.wav	This is in the ideal generated by z bar 0 bar, but 2 bar is not 0 bar right	train
audio_0_233920.wav	And, are given a chance to perform, within that department, in that organization	train
audio_0_188299.wav	This course is also not about big data per se and we are not going to cover big data concepts such as map reduce, hadoop frameworks and so on	train
audio_0_231910.wav	The English here refers to the people, when you use the article the, before English it refers to the English people	train
audio_0_57748.wav	so this output will be ready by five	train
audio_0_61092.wav	similarly, on the right, with x two, you add f, c, b, f, c, b, similarly from top, and the, the other way round, sharing horizontal edges: g, a	train
audio_0_116374.wav	so that services is based on that ah or based on the context need to be looked at right ah	train
audio_0_63666.wav	so my original specification i try to map using those functional blocks or cells	train
audio_0_222365.wav	Finally, we pickup 9 and when we pickup 9, we find that it has neighbors 6, 8 and 10, 10 is new, so 10 gets marked and added to the queue	train
audio_0_239180.wav	They should be relevant to, what the employee knows, and what the employee is working towards	train
audio_0_55727.wav	you can say this is approximately equal to n into four t	train
audio_0_60692.wav	ok, so some of the salient ideas is that at every level of partitioning so you use vertical and horizontal slices so that the available layout area is partitioned into horizontal and vertical subsections alternately	train
audio_0_193475.wav	So, in the case of Z, it is very clear that they are both the same concept; an element is irreducible if and only if it is prime	train
audio_0_233816.wav	Break a long talk in to series of five minute talks, and practice	train
audio_0_97742.wav	So, let me just to complete the discussion you have understood why namespace is important	train
audio_0_135598.wav	So in spite of Conrad’s criticism, Achebe argues, Conrad still could not jettison this notion that Africans are lesser human beings	train
audio_0_171679.wav	So, in this case the element is light bulb	train
audio_0_29185.wav	That is why we will write it this say	train
audio_0_152478.wav	So, that is the distribution and then the reason why I am talking about distribution is connected to the small concept of Alan Weston’s categories of fundamentalist, pragmatist, unconcerned	train
audio_0_212262.wav	let us say five volts minus three point three maximum load current of point five amps	train
audio_0_153284.wav	In this module I am listing 9 components of body language, which we are going to discuss in detail later on	train
audio_0_10298.wav	If it is purely resistive, then your current I 2 and V 2 both are in phase right	train
audio_0_122060.wav	This is the extract that I want to look closely because this particular extract finishes off that episode, that episode about the crisis between the shop owner and Ravutta	train
audio_0_165341.wav	Similarly, the elements which are parallel in force voltage analogy get connected in series in force current analogous system	train
audio_0_32102.wav	So, this is the first order node based element in 2D ok	train
audio_0_47562.wav	And to the demerator winding I have connected a diode	train
audio_0_173178.wav	This is doable and it can be incorporated into some of the courses	train
audio_0_212368.wav	and what should it run	train
audio_0_166057.wav	So, at the first instance you will consider it as a non planar	train
audio_0_215247.wav	if it is an analogue interface, it will be through an analogue to digital converter interface	train
audio_0_12207.wav	So, exciting current means I 0; so, that is negligible very very small right	train
audio_0_27570.wav	Job scheduler maintains a list of pending jobs with priorities	train
audio_0_56591.wav	test grading concerns the determination of the quality of a given set of test vectors	train

audio_0_27132.wav	So, you can imagine that if you are making changes to a file by both reading it and writing it, this can create confusion	train
audio_0_196775.wav	Because this picture, it looks like this	train
audio_0_136243.wav	So in other words, the coffee estate is presented as a site of barbaric violence and exploitation where the line distinguishing between the British colonial exploiter and the poor Indian exploited is very clearly drawn	train
audio_0_131651.wav	so lets say, if i draw something that looks like a pipe in this manner and call this a heat pipe, then the effective conductivity along the axial direction k effective, lets say in the axial direction, is very, very high	train
audio_0_14882.wav	So, resultant will be i 2 minus i 1 and that means my ah i y is equal to basically i 2 minus i 1 is equal to i, so it is i right	train
audio_0_94700.wav	why cant you stand a chance if you are having these qualities	train
audio_0_76021.wav	If they use rheology and compression measurements, so these demonstrated that as tumor progresses	train
audio_0_185180.wav	So, the question became, how do we achieve capacity for such a system	train
audio_0_62687.wav	in fact these are specifically the steps which i shall be discussing in this course in significant detail	train
audio_0_197358.wav	7 during positive peaks of the sine wave and minimum value will be 4	train
audio_0_63100.wav	many look like h, may not look like x, but it will be a tree nevertheless	train
audio_0_43026.wav	So, both cases are possible depending on depending on the thickness of the layer and this how I set this parameter right	train
audio_0_226351.wav	So, whatever this rotates, you can measure it at a very small accuracy	train
audio_0_1508.wav	So, I mean it is for wave connection	train
audio_0_184383.wav	The feedback by the way is anonymous	train
audio_0_154195.wav	Sometimes, it is just a polite way to make someone else feel comfortable, thank service for the smile	train
audio_0_173976.wav	We will be seeing more of this in later units	train
audio_0_208209.wav	Name them as a ' and a	train
audio_0_108905.wav	So, how many workshops you conduct, how many forums open forums you have, what are the ways in which ideas can be collected and verified and scrutinized all these things would affect the ranking under the ARIIA framework	train
audio_0_41309.wav	Remember the shape function that we had shown in the very beginning, right	train

audio_0_81157.wav	We have seen in the earlier lectures, the formula also now we know very well	train
audio_0_103286.wav	At this point, you have feeling little lost in terms of the hierarchy, it will good to take a print out of that slide and keep it by the side, so that you can quickly refer to it	train
audio_0_188828.wav	So, if you look at row 5, we have made a choice that the rst constraint is active, the second constraint is inactive and the third constraint is inactive, that basically means the first constraint is equal to 0, the second and third constraints have to be less than equal to 0, which needs to be tested after we go through the solution process	train
audio_0_188289.wav	So, these are at a conceptual level what you would expect the participants to take out of this course	train
audio_0_121033.wav	So, he cannot understand this betrayal, this treachery and we can see how financial troubles lead to emotional conflicts	train
audio_0_186203.wav	So, once you have done this, for a particular choice of the model parameters, let us say you have building a linear model	train

audio_0_42251.wav	Actually solving this these equation is now there is no great mystery over here, we have already know it what is the process	train
audio_0_166810.wav	So, this will be sorted because you have a current voltage source connected which was short circuited	train
audio_0_173223.wav	So it is no longer designing a course purely based on a particular disciple or a subject	train
audio_0_226815.wav	So, this is the scale pointer which I said; this is the moving coil assembly, this is the hair spring which we have; there are the two permanent magnets north pole and south pole, moving coil assembly is this is the moving coil assembly, ok	train
audio_0_36885.wav	So, that is the reason why the definition of RCS has this 2 pi over here and in the case of 3 D I have 1 by r so to speak right	train
audio_0_181420.wav	So, the difference that you have between your transmit signal and your received signal is approximately 130 dBm; 10 on a dB scale means that it is a factor of 10 you can see that if it is 130 this is a orders of magnitude larger	train
audio_0_11633.wav	So, that is why this current will be actually rms value it actually 5 angle 45 degree now ah that let me clear it	train
audio_0_35254.wav	So, now what we have done is we have got N equation, N variables seems like something we can solve right	train
audio_0_194858.wav	It is not a fixed number, it also depends on the operating point	train
audio_0_95623.wav	so how will you do that	train
audio_0_197905.wav	It is still very likely to be much better than constant VG is biasing but it is not as good as biasing it with an actual current source	train
audio_0_43607.wav	So, for example, this is your T 1 this is your T 2 and this is your T 3 ok	train
audio_0_193579.wav	This means a squared plus 5 b squared divides 4	train
audio_0_184751.wav	Each carrier as a function of time you adjust the power and the bit allocation, and the next time instant you keep changing it	train

audio_0_64867.wav	reducing cut size is, of course, yes, you have to minimize the delay in the critical paths, thereby satisfying the timing constraints	train
audio_0_98359.wav	Again area one of them, both of them use the same number of parameters to both of them use the same types of parameters int int and int int, but their return types are different	train
audio_0_97920.wav	So, whenever its size underscore t is written you will know that an unsigned int is meant and particularly it is size of something, most often it is a number of bytes of some structure and so on	train
audio_0_40891.wav	So, this is what the RF engineer design skill and gives it to you	train

audio_0_176668.wav	It provides some guidance that is how clearly the outcome statements need to be written	train
audio_0_236058.wav	Now, approach to managing ethics	train
audio_0_7870.wav	If it is a current source it has to open, if it is a voltage source it has to short right at that time current is taken here is i 3 for this branch it is taken has i 3 right; that means, in that current earlier in the circuit your i actually is equal to your i 1 plus your i 3 right, because this is your what you call this is the voltage v is equal to this voltage v 1 because superposition then is voltage v 2 right	train
audio_0_135301.wav	So, some where you can visualize this theory in little symbolic order	train
audio_0_156540.wav	So this is the ideal normal form and this is mostly theoretical and everything after 3NF or BCNF is mostly theoretical and database practitioners do not attempt to do it so this is in that's it and so once the relation is in decay and if this is no anomaly there is absolutely no anomaly and all the functional dependencies and multivalue dependencies need not be checked anymore so this is the ideal case and that ends the topic on normalization so essentially given a relation one would try try to normalize it up to CNF or BCNF	train
audio_0_240088.wav	Investing in the training of an employee, will definitely increase the commitment, from the employee	train
audio_0_146077.wav	So, so far we have been looking at the one of the very important but simple real time task scheduler known as the cyclic scheduler	train
audio_0_229356.wav	These things are deceptive sometimes	train
audio_0_238634.wav	How do they know, that they can develop, themselves	train

audio_0_63408.wav	second, one is vertical constraint, so means there is no horizontal over lap, there is no dependency in v, c, g, then only you can possibly merge them in a single track	train
audio_0_32212.wav	So, this function if you look at this is the first basis function	train
audio_0_101032.wav	So, it is looked at this way that finally, in programming, it is about deciding on what state the object is in and with the use of methods, what is the next state the object could get into	train
audio_0_239172.wav	So, or you know, stretch yourself to the limit	train
audio_0_180096.wav	What is the advantage of having more number of channels in a pool and this also told us that once you do the frequency planning you could do fixed channel assignment, you could do a dynamic channel assignment which would probably be the mostly beneficial or you may want to do something which is a hybrid channel assignment	train
audio_0_41768.wav	So, there are many conventions, one conventions simply is in the following way from smaller local node number to greater local node number right that is that could be 1 convention	train
audio_0_185455.wav	Now how are priorities implemented in the CFS scheduler	train
audio_0_74891.wav	So, what she is probed was the relationship ECM stiffness and malignancy in breast cancer	train

audio_0_223442.wav	So, this tells us that between these two words, the longest common subword has length 3	train
audio_0_135732.wav	So, if we read Spivak's writing, we will see that when she is talking about this brute physical violence, to which she was exposed as a child, she is talking about a strange nexus between the British colonialist and the middle class nationalists	train
audio_0_151035.wav	So in this stage my husband like like say if a person is not very much active on Twitter but active on Facebook and how can we link	train

audio_0_181122.wav	So, what would easiest what would be the way is draw a line the blue line which is basically connecting along the centers of those sides until you reach that cell which is marked 2 and then from that point it is a 90 degree turn and then you can basically form a right angle and find out what is the distance of let us call that as A B and C	train
audio_0_224079.wav	What sequence should we do it, so that whenever we want to approach a task, the constraints that are required for the task are satisfied	train
audio_0_91612.wav	So, we can now evaluate this integral which is 2 Pi i and the sum of all these residues which each of them is 1 by 10 so we have 4 by 10 here and then 2 Pi i	train
audio_0_217180.wav	of course, we also discussed a great deal about r	train
audio_0_147422.wav	This is Facebook inspector on the Chrome store, and basically you can add this to your browser, I mean I already have it on my Chrome otherwise it should say add to Chrome	train
audio_0_43220.wav	So, they are different and therefore, the radar cross section is going to be different	train
audio_0_124795.wav	now its clear that this series combination of two one kilo ohm of resistors is across v one	train
audio_0_85451.wav	Now assume that we are actually running this particular process and this is our victim process and side by side we also run a spy process which is continuously running the prime and probe scanning the measuring the time taken to make memory accesses to a different sets in the cache	train
audio_0_62178.wav	so there are lot of i mean ah sharing need to do a lot of complex analysis in order to determine various parameters so as to reduce the clock skew in these cases	train
audio_0_115043.wav	so it, as we understand it, has too think one is that role, a detection that is there, if there	train
audio_0_205554.wav	So, in today's class we have learned about full section details, half section, offset section and revolve sections	train
audio_0_16325.wav	We know that is is equal to n S minus n upon n, so here n is equal to n 0	train

audio_0_96544.wav	as i said, writing is a matter of practice, and somebody has rightly said: practice makes a man perfect	train
audio_0_8889.wav	So, so, if you look into that that same equation whatever just I said that I am putting in this form whatever I written you just put it and you will get in the same form right just for the purpose of your explanation I ah explanation I wrote everything	train
audio_0_187099.wav	So, we do a one sided test if we choose the level of significance as 5, 5 percent then we choose the upper critical value from the F distribution with 1 and n minus 2 degrees of freedom and 5 percent level of significance or what we call the upper critical values probability is 5 percent 0	train
audio_0_27861.wav	The first append or the first operation on the list that I do will have to be legal, for that I have to tell it that it is a list	train

audio_0_154497.wav	This finding was later on supported by various other researchers and particularly I would like to quote the findings by Stalter	train
audio_0_153704.wav	I went toe to toe with this woman and she would not budge	train
audio_0_232482.wav	So, whatever is before them, if they can occupy, they occupy that	train
audio_0_178582.wav	So, observations about MRC, what are the things that I need to know for MRC	train
audio_0_2797.wav	And Pm will see it is a mechanical power output per phase that is why divided by 3, we will see later	train
audio_0_57474.wav	lets see some of the techniques, like a couple of ah very useful techniques which are practiced they refer to as a retiming and useful clock skew	train
audio_0_183177.wav	Now if you have a GSM transceiver which is using multiple time slots, then you may require the transmission reception may happen at the same time and there is a requirement that you would have a duplex filter	train

audio_0_57217.wav	so there can be momentarily some transitions before the output settles down	train
audio_0_213037.wav	and we wanted, because we think that before we build anything, before we buy this chip, this chip and hook up all these components, ah, you may have to simulate and see whether it is suitable for our conditions	train
audio_0_169815.wav	Now you have the circuit as shown in the figure in which the capacitor is connected in parallel with the series combination of 8 ohm, and 8 ohm resistance, and j 10 ohm impedance	train
audio_0_23968.wav	You are doing a project	train
audio_0_135160.wav	So this is the entire report and here you have also having option interpretation option, from here you can see entire interpretation related to the result and here is the list of the norms	train

audio_0_147794.wav	This operation will remove the nodes which do not fall in to the particular range which we have defined	train
audio_0_149587.wav	So, for instance, the way we can define day is percentage e percentage b	train
audio_0_185307.wav	So, basically Zr of t is equal to sum of sinusoids	train
audio_0_15097.wav	So, like your armature control in shunt motor	train
audio_0_68081.wav	So it means you have to divide your cultural milieu into two different phases, a division phase, a differentiation phase	train
audio_0_27719.wav	Once again the cost of delete max will be proportional to the height of the tree which as we said earlier is log n	train
audio_0_124519.wav	it will remain at zero, ok, the capacitive voltage will remain at zero and it will start building up	train
audio_0_99921.wav	So, now when you do p A pointer f, it looks at the function the class A, and then it finds that the function f is virtual, which means that it needs to be dynamically bound	train
audio_0_206559.wav	And, there 30 angles we have to locate join these lines	train
audio_0_168222.wav	Yesterday we also discussed that the mesh analysis is only applicable to circuit that is planar, planar means the circuit which can be drawn on a plane and it does not have any branch which are crossing one another	train

audio_0_94995.wav	you know most of most of us, when we go for the presentation, should check whether we have the right appearance	train
audio_0_44011.wav	Well if you this was part of one of the assignments earlier	train
audio_0_23658.wav	But in some areas I cannot take my bags, so there I write in my mobile phone	train
audio_0_32739.wav	Now let us come to the other case; the other case is case b where I have a very similar, but a oppositely deform contour this is how it is	train
audio_0_56558.wav	s divide by this, this will be the percentage gate overhead	train
audio_0_180984.wav	So, the notion that that would that would result in for the example what that would be would have to be done in MacDonald’s design would that let us say you know this cell when he did the splitting was one area where there is a likelihood of high traffic density and G was another area of high traffic density you would have to do cell splitting in both those areas	train
audio_0_221346.wav	So, therefore, all I need to do to determine exactly which path I am taking is to fix the position of the 5 rights moves among the total 15, right	train
audio_0_216178.wav	then storage, right, what you see here is this pulse data that we want to actually measure from a patient ah in a hospital, let us say, and automatically it should appear on this cloud system	train
audio_0_43590.wav	It will be linear only because, when I am taking the gradient	train

audio_0_230414.wav	Looking into the direction, we either add or subtract, so that is why it is called as the combination of angle gauges	train
audio_0_20013.wav	And that 20% portion which is fixed will not change because of units but it will change by 10% because of change in the operating cost	train
audio_0_110256.wav	5, R bar may be 1, R bar may be 3, etcetera infinite	train
audio_0_222655.wav	So, we do not want to keep going around in circles and doing the same problem again and again	train
audio_0_139852.wav	So, it is in this position, look at the position then, what is the flow, cylinder H extending means it flows through this check valve open direction flows into cap end, goes out through this, flows through and returns, this is here is time	train
audio_0_132402.wav	so i squared r, i squared rl is going to be not, not the maximum value if you have m greater than one and so which means the external resistance is greater than these	train
audio_0_107015.wav	Further there has to be a disclaimer stating that no claim is made by virtue of a registration of any right to the exclusive use of words, letters, numbers, colour, colour combination or trademarks as appearing in the representation, which means subject matter of trademark is not covered here	train
audio_0_44067.wav	So, this is let us say the 2 points a and b what does it do is say is instead of putting a rectangle through the midpoint, I let me put trapezium that covers this right	train
audio_0_94181.wav	dear friends, whatever you do, whatever way you act, it is but important that we remember and realize what has been said in dhammapada: all that we are is the result of what we have thought	train
audio_0_102976.wav	For example, here I just show with 1, so I have a 1, so if set jump comes here, then the normal condition it will have a 0; if it is executed long jump, it will come with 1, so the else will get satisfied where you can find out what situation is	train
audio_0_141914.wav	So, this is common size	train
audio_0_171253.wav	Now let us take 1 example	train

audio_0_167819.wav	So, in this class we will continue our discussion on the Thevenin's theorem but we will discuss more about the dependent sources that may be the voltage or current	train
audio_0_28717.wav	So, I need this condition and now if this is a commons subword of length k at i j then what remains of subword namely this segment from i plus 1 to this and j plus 1 to this must also match and they must be in turn be a k minus 1 length subword from here to there	train
audio_0_60737.wav	so i am showing the solutions only a	train
audio_0_179663.wav	Nothing says that you cannot do that	train
audio_0_67926.wav	So, we have already talked about the purpose in the previous slide	train
audio_0_189199.wav	You can actually see, for example, mean trip length is 19	train
audio_0_91827.wav	So this Morera theorem says that if f is continuous in a simply connected domain D, so we are not talking about analyticity now here in the Cauchy theorem it was like f is analytic then we have this integral 0, now we are going other way round that if this integral is 0, so we have the assumption that f is continuous in a simply connected domain D	train
audio_0_107018.wav	The applicant or the person who makes the application or the legal representative or the assignee can file for a design and the person who files for a design or who applies for a design is regarded as the owner and the application is filed before the design wing of the patent office	train

audio_0_233654.wav	You are not able to implement, whatever new, you have learnt for various reasons	train
audio_0_132406.wav	and similarly you can put the same, put this value into the definition of ah efficiency and get the corresponding efficiency as well	train
audio_0_94828.wav	and then, once you have learned the art of practicing, then the final thing comes, that is, giving the presentation, or making the presentation	train
audio_0_27226.wav	So, this is the equivalent formulation of the same loop	train

audio_0_40241.wav	Where all are we enforcing this	train
audio_0_191849.wav	gcd of a i is 1, so the gcd of c a i is c; gcd of d b i is d	train
audio_0_165317.wav	So the same value we will use and we will say that the forced response is nothing but the source voltage, so this we have got, so what we can write now the complete solution for the overdamped, underdamped and critically damped cases can be written as vt, so in case of overdamped you will say that it is Vs plus A1 e to the power sigma 1t plus A2 e to the power sigma 2t, in case of critically damped we have to write just Vs plus A1 plus A2 t into e to the power minus alpha t, for underdamped case you will write Vs plus e to the power minus alpha t into A1 cos omega dt plus A2 sin omega dt, so this would be in case of underdamped case	train
audio_0_135909.wav	Now here I would like to clarify a point that though I keep referring to the village society of Umuofia and though even while reading the novel you will come across the phrase “the village of Umuofia”, Umuofia is actually the name of a clan in the novel	train
audio_0_176151.wav	The classical example is let us look at this	train

audio_0_109640.wav	So, we could come up with the definition of intellectual property right either as rights which belong to a particular nature which protects creative and intellectual products that come out of human labour or you could have a list of things on which an intellectual property right may manifest	train
audio_0_196579.wav	The reason this is used more often with op amps is that the gain of the op amps as such is very high, whereas these numbers like GMR that you get in single transistor circuits is not very high, but the same principle applies	train
audio_0_134796.wav	Therefore in short term there is a possibility of a rehearsal, which could either be maintenance oriented or it could be elaborative in nature	train
audio_0_161600.wav	So that is the commit operation that's been done	train
audio_0_235400.wav	So, is the employee, more focused on achieving her or his goals, than contributing to the organization's goals	train
audio_0_207713.wav	Now, if I tilt that you see something else, like this line you will see this one and also that backside line here you see this one	train

audio_0_8016.wav	So, if you apply your KCL at node 2, then this i 4 is incoming so, this current is incoming that is i 4 right, but other current that i 6 and i 2 it is living the terminal is equal to your i 6 plus i 2 right	train
audio_0_20058.wav	So, total cost into 70% because 70% is a fixed component into 1	train
audio_0_151875.wav	So, if your x axis is time again less than one minute, one minute to one hour, one hour to one day, one day to one week and greater than 1 week	train
audio_0_219197.wav	well it’s quite obvious they must from a DAG, because if there are cyclic dependencies you cannot compute one before the other	train
audio_0_64398.wav	you want to find out which one of them is better	train
audio_0_1525.wav	Now here before anything we do we have to understand little bit	train
audio_0_222458.wav	So, to motivate the problem, let us consider the following example	train
audio_0_81220.wav	The Op Amp is l m seven l m 307 where Vos is 10 millivolts and Ib 300 nano ampere Io V is 50 nano ampere right	train
audio_0_158006.wav	So it's essentially nanosecond or some orders of magnitude larger than nanoseconds time to do any computation on the data that is brought to the main memory	train
audio_0_154877.wav	On the basis of listening to the other people’s voice, we can easily make out not only the emotions and feelings of the other person, we can also understand certain other aspects of that individual’s personality	train
audio_0_25533.wav	Recap of the classes	train
audio_0_189601.wav	In this lecture, what we have going to see are the first 3 left join, right join and inner join	train
audio_0_155142.wav	At the same time our silence can help the other person mark the difference in discourse types and conversational styles, whether it is a question or a surprised expression	train
audio_0_159699.wav	And then there will be a right to this B	train
audio_0_181149.wav	So, basically this is how we would label the u v system	train
audio_0_96464.wav	so it is always advisable that unfamiliar words should be substituted by, should be changed by, familiar words	train
audio_0_191344.wav	I need to now prove the following statement	train
audio_0_80140.wav	And we have applied plus minus 15, we have to apply plus minus 15, that is the biasing voltage that is the biasing voltage to the operational amplifier all right	train
audio_0_122915.wav	He went to Oxford, he went to the bar and these are places visited usually by the British Higher Society	train
audio_0_58095.wav	but this example actually shows you that it is possible to find a sequence of moves through which, from a bad solution, you can go to a good solution	train
audio_0_159353.wav	So there is no problem with S as far as database consistency is concerned	train
audio_0_195785.wav	So that's how we can get a voltage which is v0 minus i i rm and we want to make it equal to VGS	train
audio_0_98998.wav	So, this is a variable, this is another variable	train
audio_0_34085.wav	So, this is my x y what should I what should this axis be	train
audio_0_207153.wav	So, in the front view after removing that part; the way how it looks like is near that hole we will be having material and again here, and there is a cut section happen through broken kind of part	train
audio_0_58427.wav	so actually this is: this is two test vectors: b can be either zero or one	train
audio_0_96104.wav	on the course title, soft skills, you have been listening to series of lectures and presently we are dealing with writing skills	train
audio_0_203070.wav	For example, if you are looking at aerospace engineering, there will be gas turbine blades, and aeroplane's wings, many aspects	train
audio_0_114555.wav	so that is a nice picture, nice analogy, like: assume that there are different it resources and i, if i open up the tap, it, i can have this applications resources falling from the tap	train
audio_0_41451.wav	So, I am trying to write Ax is equal to b	train
audio_0_88555.wav	Now out of all of these various steps and organizations involved during the design and manufacture of an IC the only steps which are completely trusted is this step where the specifications are written the package testing that is done after the chip is fabricated and the deployment and monitoring of the chip	train
audio_0_138700.wav	So what I am trying to say is that because of these load disturbances if you set a particular speed that may not be obtained	train
audio_0_82648.wav	I have different voltage gain, I have voltage gain Vo / Vin, for that if I change it to gain in terms of decibels, I can plot frequency versus decibel or frequency versus gain	train
audio_0_137631.wav	So obviously, you will find that they are acceptable, when, see the set point, every time there is a set point change such an oscillation will actually result, it will die down and then from then on after it dies down the loop will exactly achieve zero steady state error	train
audio_0_96499.wav	you suppose we could have said very directly: we have received complaints about the acs	train
audio_0_16210.wav	So, now this one determine the voltage across the 5 ohm resister for the dots given in the diagram, then reverse the polarity in 1 coil and repeat	train
audio_0_104880.wav	The way, if we have to define a integer pointer we say int star p	train
audio_0_113826.wav	So, voltage, but two equal resistances this R S and R L equal	train
audio_0_176837.wav	Previous agencies worked on commission basis but now they get fixed amount of remuneration on a specific project	train
audio_0_122889.wav	There is a very direct reference to the bungalow that he has and it's a big bungalow with, you know, probably several stories	train
audio_0_73178.wav	It will be much more easy to compute	train
audio_0_141804.wav	Now let us go to assets, tangible, intangible assets, capital work in progress, other assets	train
audio_0_64742.wav	v two and v four are the closest	train
audio_0_224841.wav	So, we have a pointed to the parent, a pointed to the left child and a pointed to the right child	train
audio_0_188902.wav	Before we jump into the techniques I would like to introduce some interesting ways of looking at data science and in a broader context understand what these techniques are doing and how one should think about data science problems	train
audio_0_227772.wav	The sensing or detecting element; the function of the element is to respond to a physical phenomenon or a change in the physical phenomenon	train
audio_0_178238.wav	And one of the things that we need is the f gamma of gamma that is the probability distribution of the SNR	train
audio_0_59854.wav	so there will be a transition after a delay of one between three and four	train
audio_0_179554.wav	So, this is the condition and this is true if gamma is greater than or equals to gamma naught, because under only under that condition the argument will be	train
audio_0_36310.wav	And it is sort of like the old saying that necessity is the mother of invention so they had no analytical solution	train
audio_0_216858.wav	the hardware specification: this is again from what the sensor manufacturer has mentioned	train
audio_0_177970.wav	So, the area of an isotropic antenna if we take it as a reference lambda squared by 4 pi, lambda being the wavelength of the carrier frequency then we derived 2 very important expressions	train
audio_0_233656.wav	Or, people are not comfortable doing things the way you would need them to do things, after you had done the new thing, that you had learnt	train
audio_0_209576.wav	And there is one more keyword name design library	train
audio_0_18804.wav	So, V C t will be 100 e to the power minus 25 t volt for t greater than 0	train
audio_0_181967.wav	But how did Alamouti work on it	train
audio_0_176724.wav	And these are generally are identified by a department advisory board or a Board of Studies and this Board of Studies identifies the Program Specific Outcomes and whereas NBA has identifies the Program Outcomes	train
audio_0_210159.wav	I would like to have one more concentric cylinder around that, if I am going to construct such kind of thing that is what we call this offset surfaces	train
audio_0_96063.wav	when you are writing from the point of view of the organization, you should maintain you should write we, but there are times when you need to be more informal	train
audio_0_87231.wav	In this particular lecture we will look at functions, essentially if we have functions present in the library how do we make these functions relocatable	train
audio_0_102944.wav	So, if you actually run this program then I will show what happens	train
audio_0_104542.wav	This is the widest form of static cast is a widest form of cast which will be used	train
audio_0_94196.wav	so, in simple terms, when we talk, maybe it is not a part of the discussion, but it is a part of the sharing of our experiences and feelings	train
audio_0_12782.wav	So, here it is it is 0 for t less than 0, and it is V s 1 minus e to the power minus t by tau for t greater than 0, this is equation 50 right	train
audio_0_215982.wav	if you are really looking at completing the loop and looking at analytics and you are looking at ah, trying to understand data collection in a big way, you obviously need a cloud based system, right	train
audio_0_221543.wav	So, shortest path never loops, so it will never does not sent vertex twice, this means that I at most have at most n minus 1 edges	train
audio_0_35270.wav	So, I have rewritten this into we can say Ax is equal to b where x is the unknown vector	train
audio_0_105704.wav	Marks that are immoral and scandalous will not be offered protection under the trademark law	train
audio_0_237963.wav	Provide training to under represented groups	train
audio_0_101220.wav	The address of b is exactly same as address of a, something that we do not expect in a call by value mechanism	train
audio_0_32359.wav	So, what is being suggested is that, in this equation what if I take a inner product on both sides with t any t ok	train
audio_0_99074.wav	So, which are basically sub types of integer we use them to initialize a date in the constructor and therefore, if you execute this program you will get this kind of an output where first the date will be constructed as in here, then it will be printed using this print and finally, it will get destructed	train
audio_0_159755.wav	So it is the update has been temporary but another transaction reads it	train
audio_0_171262.wav	Now let us talk about the balanced Delta Delta Connection	train
audio_0_93082.wav	appearances can be deceptive and, as i often say, i often quote, a false face must have a false heart within	train
audio_0_226751.wav	So, if you see here, it is the receiving station, ok	train
audio_0_12167.wav	That is why you perform open circuit test on thelow voltage side in the laboratory, But either side, it is possible	train
audio_0_57371.wav	so there will be some um, um, power consumption inside	train
audio_0_196670.wav	And I increase it finally until it reaches 200 and then I stop there	train
audio_0_97589.wav	So, the child class should be able to access it that is D should be able to access it	train
audio_0_77948.wav	So, your θ is 70 degrees because the new filament gets added at an angle of 70 degrees	train
audio_0_84130.wav	So, you could see the output generally it was close to 400 milli volts or 300 something milli volts, right	train
audio_0_225855.wav	So, not it well to be valid witness y is here, then I cannot pick not wide to be the witness to the next hour, because y and not y contribute each other	train
audio_0_228301.wav	And will go to construction here then will select the angle, ok	train
audio_0_212210.wav	if if v in is five, v out is three point three	train
audio_0_206055.wav	Let us observe one of the side view	train
audio_0_39008.wav	So, all your weight of machine learning and you know deep learning and all of that can be applied to this to try to learn where might be the correct valley from a lot of data to tell you where to land up in ok	train
audio_0_205228.wav	Let us look at front view	train
audio_0_186325.wav	So, let us see how to do this I am assigning a variable value of 100 to the variable n and I am initializing the sum as 0	train
audio_0_5402.wav	8 degree, it is lagging, this all voltages are same 44	train
audio_0_162802.wav	Theta s will be sin inverse 2 into 4	train
audio_0_225047.wav	So, the claim is that in such a situation, we cannot have a different answer, because of even if you allow our self to shuffle jobs in same deadline	train
audio_0_13000.wav	Now, it is true also for dependent sources	train
audio_0_114442.wav	So, people come up with a double stub tuning where the 2 stubs are used not 1 stub, but the distance between the stubs that is called d that is fixed this 1 is fixed	train
audio_0_28438.wav	You have a condition; if it is true, you define f one way; otherwise, you define f another way	train
audio_0_91346.wav	So, that we can correlated if we say that T 1 by root about that your square root of L 1 is equal to T 2 by square root of L 2	train
audio_0_8728.wav	It will be very I mean only at first year level	train
audio_0_37570.wav	Minus 1 by	train
audio_0_62941.wav	this topology you directly map into a stick diagram and from the stick diagram you try to generate the layout	train
audio_0_228758.wav	So, if the any statistical analysis has to be applied, the uncertainty has to be type A uncertainty	train
audio_0_7932.wav	So, substitute equation 2 and 5 in equation 3 and 4 right	train
audio_0_223302.wav	So, if we use this greedy strategy we would allocate this very long booking and the entire period it will be allocated to just one teacher, whereas if we choose the booking that start a little later, then we could actually satisfied six teachers bookings and since our goal is to maximize the number of teachers, who can use the room that could be a better strategy	train
audio_0_239934.wav	And, they need to do this, on their own	train
audio_0_151398.wav	Now, I am going to look at different set of questions within the context of using content from social media from the Police Organizations itself	train
audio_0_220678.wav	So, if you think of these as tasks with dependencies means that I can do the task in such a way that before I do k, I would have finished its dependence task j	train
audio_0_98385.wav	So, you are trying to basically decide on this multiple form and then, you say that this is static	train
audio_0_218931.wav	So, given the large number N, the student is expected to find two prime numbers p and q, such that p times q is equal to N	train
audio_0_143435.wav	If their value falls, because as you use the asset, suppose you own a car, when you use your own car, you don't have to pay any rent, but the value of your car is falling	train
audio_0_206708.wav	Similarly, from the front view we have those parts, from similarly front view we have these parts, in this way we can construct our isometric drawing	train
audio_0_114493.wav	So, this is inter stub distance you see this is the ninety degree rotation of the 1 plus j b circle or 1 plus j b circle is this a lambda by 2 separated 2 stubs	train
audio_0_102835.wav	So that is a basic issue of exceptions situation	train
audio_0_152153.wav	Can we actually take these sources, shaadi dot com and pictures from Flickr and Facebook, connected to identify sources which are on Facebook, I would actually reveal that I am so and so on	train
audio_0_63555.wav	so, as part of this course, in the next few course modules we shall be discussing the issues like partitioning, floor planning, placement, routing, so how the interconnection among the modules or the blocks or the circuits nodes are carried out	train
audio_0_215490.wav	ok, so master continues to be the reader, and that is important	train
audio_0_7212.wav	7 shows simple circuit than the current i the conductance G and the power p	train
audio_0_62860.wav	so one is the source, one is the drain, and in between there is an oxide insulation layer on top of which a polysilicon layer is created which forms the gate	train
audio_0_176609.wav	First thing is “relevance”	train
audio_0_38384.wav	So, what approach should we take, what we did in the theoretical calculation	train
audio_0_16022.wav	002 meter divided by this one right	train
audio_0_110827.wav	And, is there any first order loop which is non touching with the second path	train
audio_0_39493.wav	So, I should expect three terms right; in the when I evaluate this integral ok, this just to anticipate what happens	train
audio_0_98193.wav	So underline, default parameter is basically nothing other than a special case of function overloading	train
audio_0_23043.wav	how does ei helps us in appreciating diversity and diverse perspectives	train
audio_0_223049.wav	2 and 0	train
audio_0_28150.wav	So, we have this global value board here which is being referred to inside the function and it does not matter that is not being passed because this is the mutable value, so it is going to look for the value which is defined outside namely this empty dictionary	train
audio_0_122232.wav	Okay, so I'm going to read an excerpt that I'm interested in	train
audio_0_184855.wav	Let me just put it with in bracket that in we have assumed that it is a flat fading channel	train
audio_0_3097.wav	So, when omega t is equal to 90 degree then I is equal to Im right	train
audio_0_101047.wav	So, basically if I pass a value as re to the set re method, then it will set that value into the re underscore component of the object on which I have called set re	train
audio_0_29475.wav	Normally	train
audio_0_89396.wav	Now there are two ways gadgets can be found one is known as intended and the other is known as unintended	train
audio_0_102159.wav	Suppose you say using base 1 colon colon f, if you say I am using base 1 colon colon f then what it will happen is, this function will be included in derived and this function will not be included, this function base two’s function will be hidden	train
audio_0_53541.wav	that is the gradient with respect to prime	train
audio_0_1340.wav	So, if it and this same way the voltage will be induced right, but if you look into that this is that instant the and this is a particular position right instantaneous position we call	train
audio_0_197704.wav	Also, you can see that in a moss transistor, the cause is applied between gate and source and the effect appears from drain to source	train
audio_0_145714.wav	So, whenever there is a automobile crash the motion sensors detect a collision and the system needs to respond by deploying the airbag within ten millisecond or less otherwise we will consider the system to have been failed	train
audio_0_32001.wav	Ohm’s law	train
audio_0_143595.wav	So, will you take 60	train
audio_0_66896.wav	Dissection challenge is you are handling an embryo which will be very teeny tiny something like something like this	train
audio_0_162368.wav	So, electric field you see that the divergence of the electric field due to the magnetic current that is 0	train
audio_0_81993.wav	Now, let us see another capacitor, ceramic capacitor	train
audio_0_190259.wav	So, minus 13 x, so that is minus 13 x cubed minus 26 x squared plus 13 x	train
audio_0_221938.wav	So, we will need the values below and to the left which is spectral diagonal, so one way of doing this is to fill up this way, so that wherever we fill up, we have the values below already and we also have the other values here left	train
audio_0_103080.wav	So, you will have to live with these kinds of possible pitfalls in the macros	train
audio_0_41242.wav	I evaluate take r inside V 2 what will happen	train
audio_0_171374.wav	You will see the poles has the value s equal to plus minus j which are not in the left half of s plane	train
audio_0_3414.wav	So, this is your, what you call this exercise is given to you solve it	train
audio_0_17307.wav	So, it is therefore, this is your node 1, this is your node 1 one current is leaving just putting like KCL ah the way we explained before, this is i 1 this current is also leaving this is i 2 right another current is there this is a common node	train
audio_0_84741.wav	We can dope the P type material, right; this is N type silicon	train
audio_0_14334.wav	And this current this is this is your this is your node node a	train
audio_0_130098.wav	You see that molecule gets excited to a higher energy state	train
audio_0_101332.wav	Now, said that if we do a reference parameter, that is if we use call by reference, then the parameter actually is input and output parameter	train
audio_0_235264.wav	And then, you cannot go back, and say, no, please give me something else	train
audio_0_56324.wav	c one is a positive edge triggered, c two is a negative edge triggered	train
audio_0_97404.wav	I have defined integer pointer, but what I have done is have taken the address of this variable, which will be a pointer to a constant integer, because it is a constant integer	train
audio_0_121327.wav	So, they have undergone hardships because of their obsession	train
audio_0_183099.wav	I hear the correct answer; the correct answer is fading	train
audio_0_186560.wav	So, from an engineering viewpoint why would something like this be important	train
audio_0_149243.wav	Now one problem in doing this is the lifetime of the access tokens that we are using	train
audio_0_150754.wav	But the source of starting this is getting you to click on the link a survey or contest	train
audio_0_205521.wav	If I am having a plane in that way, pass through that and again pass through that; how it looks like	train
audio_0_65438.wav	So, we are into week 7 lecture 2	train
audio_0_176367.wav	That depends on what criteria you are using depends on your values and standards	train
audio_0_47332.wav	You may already have heard about the buck converter, the boost converter, bug boos converter	train
audio_0_149968.wav	However, an average, median and maximum users do tend to experience very long periods of times between consecutive tips and dones	train
audio_0_19444.wav	Now let us see what happens if number of students go up to 150	train
audio_0_10144.wav	It has resistance is given; it is resistance is given 0	train
audio_0_229710.wav	02, this can be 40	train
audio_0_155177.wav	The association in controlling the body language to control the human mind has been commented on by Foucault in this lecture and we have already seen how this idea has been reinforced by recent scientific researches	train
audio_0_65060.wav	ah, once i have the topology, i have to actually connect my physical clock terminals, the sinks, to some lead node of this tree, that is the geometrically embedding	train
audio_0_226942.wav	The next question is how do people measure the flow of water flow of water in a dam, ok	train
audio_0_228286.wav	So, I will put A 90, A movement is 90 and B is 180	train
audio_0_154653.wav	For instance if I am sitting next to you and you are over here my leg is crossed with my toe pointed toward you that is a signal that I am interested in engaged in what you are saying	train
audio_0_17705.wav	So, at steady state current will be your 0	train
audio_0_208099.wav	If we can do that, that is what we call normal	train
audio_0_69476.wav	now, just for simplicity sake i am just putting it like: and these cells are suspended	train
audio_0_25769.wav	So if you do a 120 degree rotation, the methyl will come here	train
audio_0_93864.wav	these time gaps will appear as the better and and when you get this better you can actually relate and coordinate and remember all sorts of speakers	train
audio_0_136405.wav	Good morning now in all these cases what we were discussing is how to produce a particular product better, so that you can make profit out of it, so as we have seen that this is typically related to what is known as auto economy of scale that is if you can produce a product in a much larger volume by using very sophisticated machines then because of the blessings of automation you can gain lot of profit that’s called the economy of scale	train
audio_0_39480.wav	So, now, let us try a little bit more of algebra to see how we can simplify things further	train
audio_0_77349.wav	So, then how will my stress versus strain curve look	train
audio_0_152828.wav	This is a very negative gesture that should be avoided if possible	train
audio_0_71501.wav	So, here directly we are getting the benefits and these benefits	train
audio_0_209086.wav	Then if we are zooming that portion it will not be any more a sharp corner	train
audio_0_179489.wav	So, the power allocation if you denote it as what we have to indicate by red, there is a normalized coefficient; it either in boost gamma or decreases gamma that is the decision that you have to make	train
audio_0_99690.wav	Similarly, you can have default type parameters	train
audio_0_224688.wav	Well, it will execute as many times as it takes for n to come down from its value to 1	train
audio_0_73349.wav	So I have already told you that in order to classify the risks, their importance, or we have to construct a project matrix we could draw up a project matrix for each project for assessing the risk here we will consider two important factors the importance of the risk as well as the likelihood the probability that the risk will occur see we have taken an example of a project risk masterx where as I have already told you we have to first write down what could be the possible risks	train
audio_0_137748.wav	So if we have a sinusoid, so we this is, this is, this is my instrument I am applying an isin ωt typically what will happen is that, if the instrument is supposed to be linear then you will get as output also you will get a sine wave but that sine wave magnitude will be higher, will be different from the magnitude of the input wave and it will also have develop a phase lag	train
audio_0_178039.wav	Now, where is the margin coming in	train
audio_0_11996.wav	I thought that I will start little bit with this kind of concept such that your our understanding will be will be little bit you known better right	train
audio_0_18197.wav	Next one is series and parallel capacitors	train
audio_0_40558.wav	I have the radiation boundary condition make sense only for something which is truly supposed to be outgoing and what is truly supposed to be outgoing	train
audio_0_102266.wav	The very interesting things is when you have to concatenate it you do not really need to copy the first string and then do concatenation, you can just say that I am adding str 2 to str 1	train
audio_0_168760.wav	Here if you see the current I2 is flowing 1 ohm resistance as well as the inductor	train
audio_0_191016.wav	But, because kernel is really defined using the notion of group homomorphism, it is more than a subset	train
audio_0_147359.wav	Now what we are looking at is the Facebook and you can go to Twitter also	train
audio_0_81670.wav	Now, the first question that should come to your mind is, it amplified how many times	train
audio_0_155161.wav	Therefore, a stereotyping is a habit should always be avoided in the context of interpreting the body language of other interactants	train
audio_0_27551.wav	Finally, we can come down to the recursive delete	train
audio_0_174383.wav	But of course that requires the curriculum redesigned	train
audio_0_140909.wav	That is no say for example you look the image and say this is a happy face	train
audio_0_102071.wav	And also as we know that the basic inheritance mechanism in C++ that is the inheritance mechanism what I mean is, is a relationship is represented in terms of public inheritance and we have heard long discussions regarding what does that mean	train
audio_0_178586.wav	And we also said that when you have a particular antenna which is very noisy, you should not be giving it a lot of weight	train
audio_0_171057.wav	Namaskar, so in the last class we were discussing about the Z parameters that is also called as impedance parameters	train
audio_0_210344.wav	Because, we want to construct surface from these vertices; so, once vertices are not, a surface which pass through these three points can be constructed using such kind of parametric variation	train
audio_0_205683.wav	For example, if we have a real scale, that length we want to represent it as a projection	train
audio_0_71735.wav	Here, K is the exponentiation to the power of something	train
audio_0_103505.wav	Further, the derive class may add more data members of its own it can have some more additional data members	train
audio_0_31580.wav	You would have heard the name of green in the context of vector calculus some identities of vector calculus are named after green right	train
audio_0_183463.wav	So, if I set my threshold as Vth how often will I cross that thresholds; that is the understanding of the level crossing rate	train
audio_0_149331.wav	So, we say access underscore token is equal to this extended token that we just generated	train
audio_0_219486.wav	So, if you type something to Google, Google will sometimes change your query to a word which is meaningful, because it recognizes that you mistyped a name or a concept	train
audio_0_102072.wav	But at the same time we know that there are other forms of inheritance in C++ particularly something which is known as a private inheritance which changes the visibility of the base class members in the derived class by restricting them to the private access alone	train
audio_0_37856.wav	E 2	train
audio_0_35651.wav	And then after that we use the divergence theorem in 2D and that came with a minus sign right	train
audio_0_59312.wav	now, this another thing which we are also showing here, which may or may not be done in the floor planning stage	train
audio_0_126907.wav	which of course, can be written as alpha times I 1 r plus beta times I 2 R which of course is alpha times V 1 plus beta times V 2 that is if we applied a current I 1 we would could have voltage V 1, we applied I 2, we would got V 2	train
audio_0_77881.wav	So, you can track the displacement as a function of time and what you can get is	train
audio_0_164767.wav	So, when the linear system is described by higher order differential equations the state diagram can be constructed from these equations	train
audio_0_55605.wav	this is left of, say, e, this is right of e, left e and right e refers to some x coordinates and top and bottom refers to some y coordinates	train
audio_0_9376.wav	So, dq as we know from the very first chapter the basic concept that i is equal to dq by dt	train
audio_0_122898.wav	And the other question to ask and observe is how does he interact with others	train
audio_0_96362.wav	there are so many shareholders, are there so many other stakeholders	train
audio_0_146976.wav	Therefore, the cell at the intersection of first row and second column gets a 1	train
audio_0_220053.wav	So, let us try and understand why this is not a very good implementation from a complexity point of view	train
audio_0_59498.wav	ok, now to estimate the timing, to estimate this gate delays and wire delays clock skew you are ignoring for time being	train
audio_0_215250.wav	this could be a still simple ah binary status of one or a zero, which could be coming through a g p i o	train
audio_0_78208.wav	So, what the tracked was essentially for each edge which tracked moved outwards they tracked the average distance moved or average position of the border	train
audio_0_112158.wav	So, power loss is this much that let us say tolerable in that case we can decide that what is the maximum load reflection coefficient you can suffer that means, return loss is defined as 10 log voltage reflection square magnitude square in dB scale	train
audio_0_54140.wav	that'll be conceptually different way of thinking about it and let us work on that and in fact what we'll see is i can actually describe this energy as if its stored in this electric field return	train
audio_0_186196.wav	And similarly, in the next round what you do is, leave out the second sample and choose all the remaining for training and then use that model for predicting on the sample that is left out	train
audio_0_43936.wav	So, it will align the triangles to be in such a way that you can get a nice smooth set of edges	train
audio_0_164413.wav	Because the topology shows us the property of the network which is unaffected when we stretch, twist or distort the size and shape of the network	train
audio_0_76400.wav	So, let me again draw the force curve, for the case where the tip does not touch the protein you will have a curve something like this; A, B, C, D, E, F	train
audio_0_183459.wav	Once the fade occurs how long will it last and how many symbols or bits will it affect	train
audio_0_190473.wav	So, let us look at another ring	train
audio_0_208866.wav	So, let us construct such in involute	train
audio_0_34884.wav	So, this is your near field consideration now not surprisingly that the other thing that we should look at is	train
audio_0_179568.wav	This is where transmission occurs	train
audio_0_216011.wav	in this case, we are talking about just the pulse information, pulse data from each and every patient on the bed, and all that the nurse paramedic actually has is a mobile phone in his or her hand	train
audio_0_135394.wav	So, 3, the rhyming word would be tree, 5 the rhyming word would be hive, 9 line, 2 shoe, 4 door	train
audio_0_94085.wav	but remember, man can change	train
audio_0_55662.wav	we looked at that how we can do placement taking into account the timing characteristic or the timing parameters in mind	train
audio_0_202323.wav	So, the axis of these two axles we can mate	train
audio_0_210296.wav	So, there always be ambiguity in terms of surface construction and it does not define anything about volumes and surfaces of the object	train
audio_0_236239.wav	And, please focus on the slide, now	train
audio_0_18566.wav	So, inductive reactant L omega and omega is equal to 2 pi f	train
audio_0_44092.wav	So, this tells you that a function f can be approximated about a point x naught in terms of increasing orders	train
audio_0_159000.wav	That's the log competitive matrix	train
audio_0_42770.wav	So, if I want to let us say get a relation between the electric fields above and below, the boundary that is my objective	train
audio_0_115783.wav	so whether we can exploit this one, whether we can schedule vms to take advantage of this relationship in order to ah conserve power, right	train
audio_0_62290.wav	so either a changes or b changes, then output will be zero, union	train
audio_0_21398.wav	I hope it is getting clear to you	train
audio_0_35306.wav	So, that is why you need as efficient away as possible of giving you this a m n to desired accuracy	train
audio_0_156267.wav	So this is one, it is doing it, wants to read F1	train
audio_0_14762.wav	That means, my V o c is equal to 3 volt	train
audio_0_144475.wav	For Goodwill, there is no particular estimated useful life, it can remain perpetually	train
audio_0_11841.wav	First what we will do, we will take the single phase AC circuit, then will go for your manual, your resonance and as well as that maximum power transfer theorem for AC circuit	train
audio_0_144097.wav	Now you have learned, already learned what are the financial statements	train
audio_0_181412.wav	1 milliwatt	train
audio_0_237886.wav	Otherwise, you could be sued, for being discriminatory	train
audio_0_13249.wav	So, it is you can write this 8 delta t	train
audio_0_158430.wav	Now, once we write this query, this has an equivalent expression of the following manner	train
audio_0_165419.wav	There we discussed what is RL and CN we stabilize the relationship and found the way to calculate the value of power P, then we studied mesh and nodal analysis then we discussed about the various network theorems in two weeks there we discussed about the Thevenin’s, Norton’s, Maximum power transfer theorem and the super position theorem and so on	train
audio_0_202491.wav	So, things there is always chance that it might be excess it might be low of that object, many factors influence these things	train
audio_0_56747.wav	ok, the circuits, inputs are a, b, c, d	train
audio_0_12904.wav	So, as as this is open, this is also open, so no current flowing through this	train
audio_0_162659.wav	So, since it does not have any theta so, there is no confusion	train
audio_0_162740.wav	Now, what is directivity of the feed	train
audio_0_147470.wav	So, in terms of actually the theme itself the data that we looked at is actually from Bangalore, Karnataka	train
audio_0_146879.wav	So 50% weight is to how much utilization of the CPU occurred in the previous times lies and the rest half is the history of CPU uses previous to the j minus 1 instant	train
audio_0_201204.wav	If we hold VGS fixed, then clearly it makes sense to use this	train
audio_0_217277.wav	with so many, with this kind of data, you can actually do some very interesting studies ah	train
audio_0_219017.wav	So, we first check is there a tour of whose cost is mid way, if there is then I will now check below is there a tour cost half of that	train
audio_0_215895.wav	ok, good, so thats about the sessions demonstration	train
audio_0_121940.wav	Now, we also should look at some of the objects associated with characters and the importance they have in the story	train
audio_0_183796.wav	This is the you can just you can do exhaustively verify because there only 4 combinations possible, you can verify that this is true	train
audio_0_8758.wav	So, I repeat again, see in the laboratory just to see this thing and before saying anything that you have a this is a 3 phase stator know in the transformer the flux was a time varying right	train
audio_0_230147.wav	So, if the surface is flat, you can see the fringe patterns continuously are the same	train
audio_0_162580.wav	So, what is this epsilon	train
audio_0_97828.wav	So, this openness is an interesting concept which is very flexible, so that, you can, in multiple, different files also, different parts of the namespace may be specified	train
audio_0_227256.wav	1 mm is a little larger	train
audio_0_239010.wav	So, you are more sensitive to the needs of the people, you end up working for	train
audio_0_1435.wav	But now it has been replaced by your cast steel this is because the cast iron is saturated by flux density of about 0	train
audio_0_54260.wav	now what is the advantage of taking displacement	train
audio_0_202530.wav	These are called parts parts of this spectacle, when you club them in a proper way you will be in a position to get an assembly that assembly makes the functionality like spectacles	train
audio_0_57491.wav	now the question is so, when we talk about the clock signal, so what should be the time period when the here a few things	train
audio_0_148371.wav	3 million posts are done on Facebook and things like that	train
audio_0_39371.wav	So, far have we specified the locations x i	train
audio_0_40426.wav	So, what is the location of the source point x prime y prime z prime, what is the location of the observation point 0 0 z right	train
audio_0_226414.wav	However, they can also be continuous binomial distribution, and on the other hand we can have a discrete normal distribution as well but more commonly used distribution for the discrete purpose for the discrete data are the Poisson and binomial and normal is generally used for continuous data	train
audio_0_30626.wav	So, that is how we get it and this looks exactly like our expression over here right	train
audio_0_197807.wav	Now when you have multiple diodes, if you have a circuit with n diodes, then there are 2 to n possibilities	train
audio_0_193238.wav	So, now, certainly on the face of it no prime works, right, because only prime that divides constant is 2, only prime that divides the coefficient of X squared is 3	train
audio_0_151013.wav	There is no probability that this feature may not be useful, but majority of the times this feature is actually very very helpful	train
audio_0_84897.wav	Because the output peak to peak is around 15 volts, it is very close to our bias voltage, suddenly, we will see the clipping; that means, that from this kind of experiments, we can easily find what is the input voltage range, what is the output voltage range	train
audio_0_122420.wav	So, close reading does open up windows into the motivations, the social backdrop and the background and the various character motivations of the people that litter the fictional landscape	train
audio_0_36742.wav	Now what am I replacing it by I am replacing this by T m dot this whole expression	train
audio_0_33020.wav	Now what happens over here is there are so, is equal to this let us let us look at the second term over here, second term is going to cancel of 1 r I will be left with a r d r by 2, r d r by 2 integrate 0 to epsilon what is going to happen	train
audio_0_220090.wav	So, members of k now become members of k primes	train
audio_0_164651.wav	So if you see the direction of the watt meter connection, you will connect potential coil from where the current coil is connected	train
audio_0_6412.wav	So, if generally any source any current flow through the short circuit, it will not go to any your what you call any other electrical element	train
audio_0_100699.wav	But here with my exception these two did not match so it comes here and matches at this point this is also known as a catch all clause because it matches everything	train
audio_0_213731.wav	ok, again, in d b m of node four	train
audio_0_71184.wav	Then we will see about the other techniques	train
audio_0_180767.wav	The way to look at it is if I were to specify a given BER level, given BER level that corresponds to some SNR	train
audio_0_55682.wav	the clock frequency can be increased as much as possible, of course, within some other limits of power consumption that will talk about later again	train
audio_0_6385.wav	So, there is my point 8 ampere that means, this is 10 i x i x is equal to 3	train
audio_0_30863.wav	If it contains a U i e inside it as you are asking a U i e then what will happened to U i e in this equation	train
audio_0_50115.wav	now we'll calculate the second b contribution to b, which will be again due to the current carrying through it, again make the same loop of s and again use the amperes law: b, dot, d, l equals to mu naught i, enclosed	train
audio_0_54773.wav	i could have thought of this m not as this through h method, but i could have thought of this m giving rise to these bound currents which are minus n cross m, which actually gave me m sine theta	train
audio_0_60595.wav	so my flip flop contains this state	train
audio_0_130676.wav	ok, so unfortunately, you cannot use it across a temperature range of three thousand, two thirty or two ambient	train
audio_0_27006.wav	So this final multiplication, we know how much it is going to cost	train
audio_0_226562.wav	What changes the location	train
audio_0_158460.wav	So the first thing, the very basic algorithm that can be employed to do it is a linear search	train
audio_0_86944.wav	So thus, if there is a snooping done on the data bus or there is actually snooping within the D RAM then what would happen is that the attacker would only see encrypted code and the sensitive data and information is still kept secret	train
audio_0_102267.wav	So, we say str 1 plus str 2, so this is pretty much like I have a variable x having value 3, have a variable y having value 5	train
audio_0_69523.wav	so these two come and, you know, form a bond like this	train
audio_0_58361.wav	so in short, we denote it as f	train
audio_0_239611.wav	The employee should know, what is coming	train
audio_0_124256.wav	oh, a first order circuit to constant inputs	train
audio_0_193396.wav	If it does have a multiplicative inverse, we call it a unit ok	train
audio_0_92440.wav	If we take any two functions from this system, for instance, we take 1, we take cos2x and 1 into cos 2x and then integrate from this minus pi to pi dx	train
audio_0_94669.wav	somebody can also say supervised, somebody can say coordinated	train
audio_0_209178.wav	Next to your Zoom buttons, magnifying lens, cut and other thing there is something like View Orientation, click that	train
audio_0_23065.wav	so thats why we have been witnessing or observing in iit s and nit s, iim s, everywhere, even in university education, emotional intelligence is getting a special, special status, how to nurture emotionally stable students, how to enhance the emotional maturity of students, how to enhance the overall emotional intelligence so that when they get into the later stage of their life they can better manage their personal life as well as their career in working organizations	train
audio_0_218196.wav	we will come back	train
audio_0_2383.wav	So, sin omega t minus 90 that is E1 right; that means, if ∅ = the reference that is your sin omega t right and it is a loss is neglected	train
audio_0_47802.wav	in a spherical coordinate system a point is specified by its distance from the origin, which i'll call r	train
audio_0_135080.wav	Let us now see another lab cession we are D2 test has been administered	train
audio_0_28832.wav	I can extend that solution by saying a 0 match is b 0 and then whatever matches	train
audio_0_94689.wav	so these also have to be mentioned in your resume to make yourself stand a better chance as compared to others	train
audio_0_57224.wav	these refer to spurious transitions, that means transitions which are functionally not expected to happen in the output due to unbalanced path delays	train
audio_0_143701.wav	It is not an exact value but it will be close to the correct value	train
audio_0_125041.wav	now lets say what happens	train
audio_0_5694.wav	So, here also v 1 and v 2 you have to find out right answers are given	train
audio_0_66147.wav	so in the last lecture i talked to you about the challenges of developing a neuromuscular junction	train
audio_0_104022.wav	Unified Modeling Language is a strong language to describe systems in the object oriented way	train
audio_0_35368.wav	So, we can take any example a particular example that I will take is that of a scattering problem ok	train
audio_0_59521.wav	so it is not necessarily true that all the inputs will be changing state at the same time	train
audio_0_232384.wav	” Learn everything you can, whether it is language, learn everything you can about a language, about a subject, any time you can, from anyone you can, there will always come a time, when you will be grateful you did	train
audio_0_152571.wav	However, a person can still escape the detection by professionals, a person can escape detection for example by police officers, by judges, by various other law enforcement agents and can also escape the mechanical lie detectors, micro expressions occur in everyone	train
audio_0_239117.wav	And, once the boundaries are defined, and you tell your employees that, this is what they can do, and this is what they are not supposed to, what they do not need to do	train
audio_0_96203.wav	by letter head i mean the name of the organization which will be there in the top center, and below that it will have to and from on the left hand side	train
audio_0_104391.wav	So we will have in this way there are six different of them	train
audio_0_176194.wav	For example most common thing is many times we think we know about something	train
audio_0_152242.wav	Experiment 3 is interesting because they actually tried using the experiment understandings from experiment 1 and 2 to take this personally identifiable with information likes Social Security Number	train
audio_0_213097.wav	there you are, so you can see slowly it is building, um, and you will see that it has stabilized to some voltage at the output	train
audio_0_192726.wav	So, I will end this video with an exercise of a statement that we have used, I have said it, but I want to emphasize it	train
audio_0_120973.wav	And how does it do that through the description of the environment and the house of Rauta	train
audio_0_180858.wav	So, this is what we would refer to as capacity that is in our term, so that was what he was trying to address as first stage efficient use of spectrum	train
audio_0_186243.wav	In this lecture, we are going to show you how to generate some basic graphics; such as scatter plot, line plot and bar plot using R, and we will also give a brief idea on why there is a need for more sophisticated graphics and how R does it	train
audio_0_168122.wav	Since this is a sinusoidally wearing term, so the value of this term over one particular time period that is between 0 to T will become 0, so eventually what we have left with this only term 1	train
audio_0_30624.wav	Similarly this will they will be two surfaces with normal’s y hat two surfaces with z hat right	train
audio_0_130775.wav	fluid is different through	train
audio_0_13141.wav	So, transform into a current source, so i will be is equal to 8 by 8 is equal to 1 ampere	train
audio_0_48768.wav	i solve the two equations and i'll get results for y transmitted and y reflected in terms of y incident	train
audio_0_225895.wav	So, this is the generic technology now, so you have some problem which is NP complete	train
audio_0_235991.wav	And, that in turn, translates into rules and laws	train
audio_0_51972.wav	This is a course on Electromagnetic Theory and any courses starts with Coulomb's Law	train
audio_0_6570.wav	So, by symmetry, H in this core is constant, because it is a right round each flux line and for the mean flux your mean flux line of radius capital radius capital R, the magnetizing force or magnetic intensity right, it can be written as H is equal to N I upon 2 pi R	train
audio_0_98269.wav	So, I have to remember that if I am using a row vector and a matrix by name of the function has to be multiplied underscore VR underscore M or something similar that is whereas if I am doing multiplication of a row vector by a column vector, then the name of the function has to be something different VRVC	train
audio_0_133590.wav	Now what Maslow did was, he basically divided these 5 stages into 2 broad categories, the B Motives and the D Motives	train
audio_0_213238.wav	when i say downstream electronics you must also note that when i say downstream, this means that there is an a d c	train
audio_0_60422.wav	so in this lecture we shall be looking at some of the algorithmic techniques that you can use to reduce the power dissipation in a design	train
audio_0_18685.wav	So, 1 upon 2 pi f C	train
audio_0_120070.wav	now, ah, if we ah again come back to our service model	train
audio_0_35350.wav	So, the word for this process is called numerical convergence	train
audio_0_162450.wav	Now, if the source is removed from the origin because this is not the general thing	train
audio_0_223491.wav	So, the first thing to note is that if I am looking for this longest common subword between these two, supposing I find that a 0, is in fact equal to b 0	train
audio_0_214536.wav	whatever we have discussed till now are very important and we will discuss a few more points and summarize everything in a nice way	train
audio_0_233898.wav	So, that the people keep themselves motivated, through the efforts of the organization	train
audio_0_193057.wav	So, again p equal to 5 works, right	train
audio_0_59437.wav	ok, so this will be the weight, the whole width	train
audio_0_12307.wav	So, voltage here V 1 minus V 2 and current flowing through this is I 1	train
audio_0_82134.wav	What is within the multimeter that operates the multimeter	train
audio_0_198901.wav	If VDD is fixed, if the supply voltage is fixed, then if you go on increasing RD, this VDS will go on reducing, the operating point VDS will go on reducing	train
audio_0_63883.wav	i am saying that whenever the clock edge comes, exactly the input will get stored in the flip flop	train
audio_0_92998.wav	Indeed, at all this is a differentiable function, the derivative exist everywhere	train
audio_0_166258.wav	And, we will also see the state equation in the today’s session	train
audio_0_182061.wav	R x diversity	train
audio_0_128870.wav	Now, usually what happens is you are given charge distribution basically the spatial distribution of charge and from that you have to calculate the fields elsewhere, and this usually involves a lot of complicated algebra	train
audio_0_1268.wav	So, around the rated full load slip of the induction motor is very small right such that are 2 dash upon S much much greater than x 2 dash	train
audio_0_228125.wav	So, that can move from one side to other side	train
audio_0_240164.wav	Are they not doing it right	train
audio_0_63434.wav	so at every step you are doing this, that means when you are en counting zone one and zone two conservative zones, to find out which nets across these conservative zones can be merged	train
audio_0_237571.wav	And, any further negative behavior, can be prevented	train
audio_0_41915.wav	On the other hand, if you look at the solutions in statics they are not wave like they are smooth solutions know; Laplace equation, Poisson’s equation they are not wave like they are smooth	train
audio_0_188355.wav	And the left hand side will have terms corresponding to multiplying the first row of A with x and the right hand side will have the term corresponding to b	train
audio_0_117508.wav	so purpose is to define a formal basis for performing and availability of service provider guarantees to the to delivery	train
audio_0_98390.wav	We are continuing the discussions on the procedural extensions of C for better C in C++	train
audio_0_236227.wav	How do we assess things	train
audio_0_145250.wav	So those are the internal events	train
audio_0_190607.wav	Now, let us look at the sum	train
audio_0_109861.wav	Now, we are interested in mismatch that is based VSWR	train
audio_0_143600.wav	So, 60,000 into 5%, so 3,000 is a commission, 60 minus 10 minus 3	train
audio_0_92177.wav	So, this was already discussed there	train
audio_0_207163.wav	So, just taking something like offset section does not serve the purpose; so there should be another way of representing that, that kind of sections what we call removed sections	train
audio_0_56482.wav	for example: ah, suppose this circuit, as i said, that it now looks like a combinational circuit	train
audio_0_195140.wav	So if VG is 3 volts, this means that the drain voltage has to be more than 2 volts	train
audio_0_162916.wav	Only the fields radiate at these because here I have a that parallel plate waveguide suddenly has an opening	train

audio_0_86585.wav	Let us say with no design flaws or with somehow guarantee that there are no hardware Trojans or no hardware flaws, still eventually there would be a human who actually uses this system, at least the many of the systems like smart phones or laptops or desktops and so on	train
audio_0_64933.wav	ok, so this b four, i am denoting by a body, b four, i am showing it in a rectangle which, as if is connected by springs to these three already placed blocks: b one, b two, b three	train
audio_0_35316.wav	So, if the problem size is very very large you need to resort to iterative methods and as the course goes I will give you little bit more information on these things, MATLAB also has these things in built alright	train
audio_0_43015.wav	So, z equal to 0 first of all I need to now impose a boundary condition here otherwise how will I terminate the wave	train

audio_0_83705.wav	The ability of a differential amplifier to reject common mode signal is expressed by a ratio called common mode rejection ratio	train
audio_0_188911.wav	So, to get a general idea of data science one might be tempted to ask that if all of these collections of techniques solve data science problems then, one would like to know what types of problems are being solved really and once one understands the types of problems that are being solved then, the next logical question would be do you need so many techniques for the types of problems that you are trying to solve	train
audio_0_321.wav	So, that above relation is always maintained as the armature rotates	train
audio_0_221815.wav	So, i minus 1 is the last sorted position, i is the first unsorted position	train

audio_0_237876.wav	I had to do this	train
audio_0_187218.wav	Let us say this is some variable that you have measured and Y is some other variable you have measured and the 3 values could represent the 3 sampling points at which you measured these	train
audio_0_35103.wav	Next we will choose the function we choose the basis function which I intuitively now is going to satisfy the I mean it is going to be close to the basis function	train
audio_0_216281.wav	on the right side i have shown you a classic paper, ok, this paper you can try download and understand this paper in detail	train
audio_0_12473.wav	051 Kilowatt hour	train
audio_0_201210.wav	This expression is independent of the threshold voltage	train
audio_0_185806.wav	So, you could verify how well the algorithm will do on the training set itself	train
audio_0_162799.wav	And you can find out that theta dB 3 dB that will be 57	train
audio_0_55775.wav	and another important property of the clock signal this also we shall be addressing later that if there are many flip flops are register in circuit	train
audio_0_219718.wav	Well, each vertex is marked and explored exactly once	train
audio_0_98173.wav	And therefore, this will result in ambiguity	train
audio_0_50245.wav	this is for r greater than or equal to r	train
audio_0_80660.wav	and the same since same current flows in M 4 and M 2; that means, that VGS 2 equals to VGS 4 right	train
audio_0_73357.wav	Their importance is very less but that is almost certain	train
audio_0_77951.wav	So, similarly you can do the same thing for the rate of branching	train
audio_0_233849.wav	Part of or one method, of a the EPSS, is the job aid, which is set of instructions diagrams, or similar methods, available at the job site, to guide the workers	train
audio_0_109942.wav	Now, we also assume two more things, one is the transformer is symmetrical, symmetrical in the sense that the reflection coefficient at the two ends the remaining is suppose I have multiple sections	train
audio_0_46199.wav	So I will leave you to go through that and use it if you feel that it is comfortable	train
audio_0_176275.wav	These are the four different cognitive levels we are concerned with	train
audio_0_61168.wav	so the volume of test data that you need to store can be pretty huge	train
audio_0_20701.wav	Now, based on this data, try to calculate the break even point	train
audio_0_92700.wav	So, here as a constant of integration we can write as a function of y and z because we were different integrating with respect to x	train
audio_0_203244.wav	Let us use this projected line into equal number of parts	train
audio_0_154501.wav	So, these instinctive signals are communicated with a help of our legs and the positioning of the feet	train
audio_0_142517.wav	And normally it is argued that professionally managed companies are better than those which are under some group so the major shareholders were various institutions corporations banks charities small investors and so on it is a it was an American company on paper a very good team of management was in charge of the company	train
audio_0_17914.wav	So, that means, this one will be 13 ohm and this is your Thevenin equivalent circuit right	train
audio_0_25103.wav	So the activity would be studying at home, right guys	train
audio_0_93192.wav	if it is so, please decide, do not have a very long sort of purse	train
audio_0_207644.wav	So, such kind of objects for example, like rectangle, square, circle, trapezium and such kind of planes if they are making different kind of angles on horizontal with respect to the horizontal planes and vertical planes how do their projections really look like	train
audio_0_101868.wav	So, this basically, if you look into this part in the middle after the construction has happened, then we may have several different use of the object, where the object, where data members are being used, the data members are being changed, different methods are getting invoked and so on and so forth	train
audio_0_33998.wav	Average	train
audio_0_63346.wav	of course, here there is another up to five, four to five also this is a constraint and five: again there is an overlap, so you have to use another track	train
audio_0_182453.wav	So, now what I do, I apply the same type of receiver and what comes out is : this 1 comes out as y 1 and I get alpha times b 1 root Eb plus eta 1, what happened to the second term because of self orthogonality right when you are not aligned perfectly at tau equal to 0 that term goes to 0	train
audio_0_138168.wav	so you see in terms of td and M and the value of the value of TI should be given in terms of td, this is what Ziegler Nichols found works well, now obviously it will not work well everywhere, so various people will say various, so we have various other kinds of rules also for example we can have a, we can have another rule which is known as the cohen coon rule	train
audio_0_107084.wav	Then the partnership between the commercial entity and the university would lead to some kind of licensing or even some kind of an entrepreneurship rule	train
audio_0_36318.wav	So, therefore, the need to now solid numerically comes about and you can see 1960s is also around the time when computers are becoming somewhat practical	train
audio_0_514.wav	Similarly, in the case of a series motor nature of the speed torque curve is similar to that of the speed current curve right	train
audio_0_23353.wav	Do not isolate much it would isolate much your depravation will be more	train
audio_0_89895.wav	So while scanning the binary file we need to look out for instructions which are interrupts or system calls so which could transfer execution outside that particular compartment and into the operating system, so these kinds of instructions are not present	train
audio_0_239199.wav	But, appraisals in many times, do not take into account, the current challenges, that people may have faced, while trying to achieve, certain objectives	train
audio_0_18639.wav	T is equal to if you take this way, T is equal to 2 pi right	train

audio_0_165452.wav	The characteristic equation you can obtain by equating the denominator polynomial of the transform function equal to 0	train
audio_0_162333.wav	So, today since in the last lecture we have introduced the concept of magnetic current	train
audio_0_64914.wav	so i am not showing, i am only show showing three, because if it is only three the equilibrium position, they will all come to all together, but there are other pulling force in other directions also	train
audio_0_37605.wav	So, W x is N 1 squared plus N 1 x actually I should I should write it little bit more careful over here it is the product of N 1 1 x with the other two terms	train
audio_0_84656.wav	So, what is R f 3	train
audio_0_136249.wav	And now the problem here is that the Bhatta is not only not a British coloniser he is also not a foreigner or even a city bred man	train
audio_0_219462.wav	So, let us look at the following two sentences; the first sentence says the students who were able to appreciate the concept optimal substructure property and its use in designing algorithms	train
audio_0_92140.wav	So, the closeness coming from the initial and the end points because they are same and the curve does not intersect itself that is what we use this terminology simple	train
audio_0_229258.wav	2, this is would the fraction defective how will I plot this chart	train
audio_0_104769.wav	And, as I had mentioned in reference to accessing different components of an array and accessing different components of a structure that there are different conventions	train
audio_0_60452.wav	well, i have said we have not yet designed the counter	train
audio_0_40444.wav	So, I could have chosen on the surface, but that would I given me a singularity in Green’s function, I choose instead the axis of the cylinder because there I will always a have non zero capital R; it is our choice and we choose it in a way that we get to avoid maximum pain fine ok	train
audio_0_206663.wav	So, these are the points what we are going to see, the points which are going to match with our earlier P point is this	train
audio_0_227944.wav	So, the major disadvantage of this null type is it cannot be used for dynamic measurement when I do force measurement I will always try to do dynamic measurement olden days when we used to do with that dial gauge, it was only maximum force measurement used to measure, but now when we have this dynamic measurement during the process of machining we are able to find out different insights what is the interaction between the tool and the workpiece	train
audio_0_226140.wav	So, here there are 2 3 parameters which I have to describe; first one is called as M, M is nothing, but the distance over wires	train
audio_0_105220.wav	Finally, I return the input stream that I have got as a first parameter	train
audio_0_165640.wav	So, if you apply KVL around this, what you get	train
audio_0_81959.wav	14 kilo ohm is the value of this resistor, right	train
audio_0_112149.wav	Now, obviously that variation of impedance that should not be much because then the purpose will be lost, because we are trying to get particular impedance from this impedance matching network	train
audio_0_70924.wav	You don't see the software until you see that it is complete and running, then only you see that screens are getting displayed, it does something	train
audio_0_135010.wav	It was incorporated in the hallstead retain battery poor performance on trail making associated with brain impairment pertaining to front allow let us now see a demo of this test	train

audio_0_102856.wav	For example, you wanted to allocate memory and the resource was low, so an exception happens, you wanted to divide by a number and that number turns out to be zero	train
audio_0_233556.wav	And, that results in a training need	train
audio_0_146495.wav	We have not written one here because the size of the task B is 2 and every frame size must hold, must be greater than or equal to the largest task size and therefore one we have not considered consider consider two three four six twelve twenty four now let's see start with the smallest frame size and see if that becomes possible to satisfy the other conditions so let's check f equal to 2 and we'll check if there is a full frame existing between the arrival of the task and its completion in the worst case	train
audio_0_147814.wav	In this graph visualization, the edges are curved, because that is what is present in the default options; scroll down in the presets default in edges and unselect the curved option again click on refresh	train

audio_0_197794.wav	But let's see if we had started off from the other assumption that the diode is off, then the diode is off, this is an open circuit, no current is flowing through this, so the voltage across this is 0 and the voltage between these two terminals, which is the voltage across the diode diode will be 5	train
audio_0_30516.wav	Different books will refer to them as different by different names, we have also studied the same theorem by Gauss theorem or in electrostatic called Gauss law	train

audio_0_186272.wav	So, when you execute these commands, this is how the bar plot looks	train
audio_0_168471.wav	Now, smaller the time constant more rapidly the voltage will decrease so, that means that you have faster time response of the RC circuit so if you see this particular figure when time constant is small that tau that is nothing but RC the product of R and C, if it is small the slope of the curve shows that the voltage is decaying very fast as compare to other so, more you decrease the value of tau more speedily would be the decay of voltage in the circuit and the you have tau lager then you will see slow response of the circuit, so we can say that is small time constant will give us a fast response and it will reach the steady state quickly whereas when we have large time constant it will give slower response because it takes longer time to reach to its steady state value	train

audio_0_59731.wav	ok, this is what we want, but my static timing analysis gives me a result like this: ok, fine, so the current practice, what you do nowadays, is that not only the signal transitions and the delays we separately look for rise time and fall time delays because, you see, i just mentioned during the last lecture, whenever there is a signal transition taking place in the output of a gate, actually it is driving a load capacities, so it is either charging through the pull of network or discharging through the pull down network	train
audio_0_219592.wav	So, in general it searches an array, remember that when we do the search we might be searching different segments depending on how far we have progressed in the search	train

audio_0_109951.wav	So, in a five one, these two are same these two are same this is something else that is called the symmetrical things gamma naught is equal to gamma n racetrack etcetera, but here we have said that Z n's are not symmetrical we do not mean that because this each one depends on this minus this, that minus thing is symmetrical	train
audio_0_65846.wav	There is a good dissection you can record it and that could be a tool for cell culture facility, that you know this is how we isolate the tissue	train
audio_0_84544.wav	Pins 1 and 5 are used for offsetting Vo to null	train
audio_0_187312.wav	A quick look at this matrix and the numbers would tell you that these two columns are linearly independent and subsequently because these columns are linearly independent there can be no relationships among these two variables	train
audio_0_195861.wav	So if ID is more than I0, that is the actual drain current is more than the desired current, then we must reduce VGS	train
audio_0_139624.wav	Name three typical functions of a data acquisition software, so one of them could be display you can figure out the other two by looking at some of the software which are advertised on the internet, so that is all for today thank you very much	train

audio_0_229507.wav	So, just recapitulate, we discussed this descriptive statistics in the last 2 lectures and we discussed the important measures of central tendency, ok	train
audio_0_65260.wav	similarly, lets say there is a point two here, there is a point two here may be there is a point two here	train
audio_0_65700.wav	as this will bend, the laser light will go like this and it will bounce	train
audio_0_165713.wav	So, if you see this the state transition matrix is depending upon the matrix A that is why sometimes it is referred to as the state transition matrix of A	train

audio_0_173488.wav	The assignments will serve a great purpose of exploring a little bit beyond what has been presented in the lecture	train
audio_0_92912.wav	So, anyway, this is the example we have seen, the last one, we have seen that there are examples where the series converges, but the sum is not equal to the function at that point	train
audio_0_42734.wav	So, this is your delta gap which is this easiest one to apply because, is just we can see the values V A by delta in the gap and 0 everywhere else	train
audio_0_104404.wav	In this way one after the other all of this functions will get called with the appropriate type with the appropriate employee record and once we are inside the record we have already seen that if the engineer function has been invoked and I have got a to the pointer to the engineer record here then I will cast and execute that	train
audio_0_122628.wav	She just leaves nothing, a lot to imagination	train
audio_0_103290.wav	So, if you do not have this, then it is just a virtual function, but when you put this, this is called a pure virtual function which means that it is not expected now that there you will need an implementation for this function for the whole code to run	train
audio_0_40245.wav	So, first equation will take this point second equation will take this point and so on	train
audio_0_19826.wav	For admin cost, the admin cost is only 20%	train
audio_0_119189.wav	the other one is the wsdl web service description language	train

audio_0_116457.wav	there are other traffic lights	train
audio_0_192886.wav	So, there is a ring isomorphism from Z mod n Z to End G	train
audio_0_195138.wav	Another way to think about it is the drain voltage going below the gate voltage	train
audio_0_197907.wav	And as you can guess the equivalent resistance, the incremental resistance of a current source is infinity, so the larger the value of this resistance, the more closely it approximates a current source	train
audio_0_180840.wav	So, typically you would want to maintain a certain threshold for your signal quality	train

audio_0_38921.wav	So, these kinds of tricks we do to make the problems more visualizable other wise you know you will just throw up your hands and say n variables, I cannot visualize it you will not getting intuition	train
audio_0_77322.wav	So, these are different bending configurations; now coming back	train
audio_0_50769.wav	now v over tau is the acceleration and therefore i can write this formula as e r acceleration times t sin theta over c	train
audio_0_130624.wav	yeah, so now how does this help us with respect to waste heat recovery	train
audio_0_191852.wav	But if you multiply all of them by 5, so you have 20, 35, 45, so the gcd will become 5, because 5 certainly divides all of them	train
audio_0_169701.wav	And we have to convert the minus sign also into the positive sign with the help of some technometric operation we just saw in the previous slide	train
audio_0_159493.wav	So that's the if these are independent	train
audio_0_119202.wav	i need to know that, where the service is launched and type of things	train
audio_0_174994.wav	That means when something happens the brain without your conscious participation will attach a negative or a positive reaction to that and it stores that	train

audio_0_180748.wav	So, Ts is your duration of the symbol that is you have the symbol rate 1 over the symbol rate is the duration of a symbol	train
audio_0_52866.wav	so again, if i look at it from the top at the cylinder i have the magnetization going in the x direction, m, and we've already seen that divergence of h is equal to m cosine phi delta s minus r and therefore, since there is no current curl of h is zero	train
audio_0_59358.wav	you partition the whole netlist into a smaller pieces and each of the piece you possibly map into individual regions may be one raw of the standard cell	train
audio_0_197855.wav	Then the power dissipated is v times i, and the power generated by this would be minus v times i	train
audio_0_28061.wav	It takes ints and produces ints, so this is the thing that you have	train
audio_0_9501.wav	So, v t micro coulomb right, there should not be any confusion in case 10, 10 to the power minus 6 and converted this v t micro coulomb right	train
audio_0_99275.wav	So, all those stacks are not here	train
audio_0_99935.wav	So, you have C colon colon g in this case C has over written whatever it had inherited	train
audio_0_56647.wav	ok, so as soon as you find that a fault is getting detected, you need not simulate to the remaining vectors	train
audio_0_210081.wav	So, what is that curve does not exist what we have these discrete data points, from there we are trying to construct it	train
audio_0_203679.wav	So, point always be there	train
audio_0_21906.wav	so with this, let us conclude this sessions	train
audio_0_43679.wav	Like when	train
audio_0_174759.wav	For example will all learning outcomes come under the same category	train
audio_0_101597.wav	Similarly, when we do student it does not construct the person instance of the student class, which otherwise I would require	train
audio_0_41545.wav	We took curl; so we did del cross del cross E	train
audio_0_114885.wav	or they are loosely coupled systems so that they there are federally cloud but they are loosely coupled system	train
audio_0_193466.wav	So, you take a positive integer, we call it a prime if it has no other positive proper divisors, it has no divisors other than 1 and p; then p is prime	train
audio_0_197061.wav	So in steady state, ID equals I 0	train
audio_0_206216.wav	So, we do not see anything depth and this one follows that one	train
audio_0_6348.wav	And similarly you have to find out your Thevenin voltage V thevenin	train
audio_0_195149.wav	Now another alternative which you would have seen in some activity questions or I even discussed it in one of the earlier lessons, is to have a voltage source	train
audio_0_102190.wav	We will introduce a basic notion of what is called vector in C++, which is pretty much like arrays, but lot more powerful and we will try to see how strings are used in C and in contrast how the string type operates in C++	train
audio_0_78797.wav	So, this is the matrix	train
audio_0_118578.wav	so dt minus rt	train
audio_0_50299.wav	So, on the line passing through the middle of a line charge at a distance x from it, the force on charge q is in direction x only and it is value is F x equals q lambda over 2 pi Epsilon 0 x L over square root of L square plus 4 x square	train
audio_0_55173.wav	then you carry out static timing analysis again	train
audio_0_11229.wav	I have made this one right	train
audio_0_144022.wav	The fourth reason is exhaustion	train
audio_0_178227.wav	Apologize for the late start, but we will never the less cover some very interesting material in today’s lecture	train
audio_0_205671.wav	Any line parallel to one of these edges is called isometric lines; this is one isometric line, any line parallel to that also isometric lines	train
audio_0_200086.wav	And in case of voltage control voltage source, the output will be exactly k times v i where this k is given by the resistor ratio	train
audio_0_50292.wav	I am going to cancel some terms, this x and this x cancels with this and gives me x only, this secant square theta divided by sec cube theta gives me secant theta which becomes cosine theta on top	train
audio_0_175356.wav	And we combine them using some weights, typically 80% and 20%, 20% to surveys and 80% to direct attainment	train
audio_0_152849.wav	Whereas in most of the countries we would find that the fist is never totally clenched	train
audio_0_157091.wav	So, cycane meaning T	train
audio_0_98931.wav	Now, it is possible that in some cases you would not be able to do that	train
audio_0_197750.wav	So, this is the criterion for choosing the capacitor or C1 must be much greater than 1 by omega R1 parallel R2 plus RS and so on	train
audio_0_225107.wav	So, we do not have to fix in advance the size of the heap that we need to keep	train
audio_0_236350.wav	If we give you the proper provisions, if we keep your working environment safe, we are ensuring, workplace health	train
audio_0_183493.wav	Basically what he said was the probability that it les in this range can be given by the joint pdf of v and v dot multiplied by dv by dv dot; so the based on calculus	train
audio_0_131476.wav	so the problem is on compressed air, energy storage given is compressor inlet, what is	train
audio_0_26564.wav	So, we are just added a comment about how the empty node is organized and the leaves are organized	train
audio_0_192987.wav	Phi is surjective, we are trying to show that it is bijective; so, we have shown its injective	train
audio_0_164057.wav	Now, if you see these 2 equations this equation is increasing exponentially and when you see this equation this is decreasing exponentially which is obvious because when the voltage settles across the capacitor equals to the source voltage	train
audio_0_142726.wav	After this we had started discussion on format as per Schedule 6	train
audio_0_154865.wav	We can say that it is what is left and perceived after detecting the verbal content or the meaning from a speech	train
audio_0_152108.wav	They strictly convey privacy is about control over information	train
audio_0_132796.wav	if you want to store a lot of energy, i can do it in two ways	train
audio_0_63312.wav	instead of a single line, that eight parallel wires which were laid out such that the delay is reduced, ok, and so on	train
audio_0_214451.wav	so dealers, essentially, when you have, when you go to a dealer to buy one strain gage, they will not tell you the strain gage ah, this gage factor of the ah strain gage	train
audio_0_74685.wav	So, in these zones you will have neuronal cells, in somewhere here you would have liver, kidney, lung and high here, then in this cluster you will have muscle cells and high up you will have bone tissue like femur or skull	train
audio_0_196724.wav	So once you calculate the output resistance, all you have to do is calculate the constraint on C2 using this and C2 to be much larger than that one	train
audio_0_25918.wav	To summarize exception handling allows us to gracefully deal with run time errors	train
audio_0_56848.wav	so i am not showing this sealing	train
audio_0_143791.wav	It is gross% for March 14	train
audio_0_8015.wav	So, if this current is here i 6 previously I did not see because it is becoming clumsy	train
audio_0_211474.wav	so let me draw your attention to the simulation tool for l t c: three, one zero nine	train
audio_0_97722.wav	So, this is a very very difficult problem	train
audio_0_18002.wav	So, it is V a by 5 plus V a minus this is one equation this is one equation you will get	train
audio_0_157366.wav	So these are the overflow buckets	train
audio_0_6953.wav	So, when R is equal to 0 so, your i is equal to v by R, right	train
audio_0_234579.wav	So, when we talk about pay for performance, we make a few assumptions	train
audio_0_28556.wav	If you want the distance of a point, we do not give it any arguments, but we always have this default argument self	train
audio_0_32832.wav	Which wave which direction is this wave traveling	train
audio_0_82438.wav	Then, what I see is that I have points on this axis, just by understanding, what is the current value for particular V G S value	train
audio_0_147937.wav	And now in this lecture I talked about some incidences that where social media is used for both positive and negative implications	train
audio_0_174677.wav	That means each course outcome is very very somewhat big in scope	train
audio_0_104190.wav	So, what will happen if we; when this instantiation is happening at this point there will be a call to the default constructor that has freely been provided by the compiler	train
audio_0_14082.wav	For example, power factor I have taken the fifth decimal place	train
audio_0_141323.wav	Suppose some infrastructure project to be started, like construction of road or construction of railways, will the debt equity ratio be higher or lower	train
audio_0_192755.wav	So, we know that there is a unique, there is very important unique ring homomorphism phi from Z to R, Z remember always represents the ring of integers	train
audio_0_101812.wav	The most significant of that is from the C++ program, if you have used bool to specify your Boolean value, anyone else who reads the program will be able to understand that this variable cannot take any other value, other than true or false	train
audio_0_36897.wav	So, and this what I can assume is that since my object this is let us say my point r prime right that is where I am evaluating this, is somewhere which is far away right that was the definition of RCS r trending to be very away from the object and my object is something over here ok	train
audio_0_21657.wav	So, contribution margin is 10 per unit	train
audio_0_220584.wav	We will study graphs more formally when we come to this module in our course	train
audio_0_94168.wav	maybe somebody is a very good singer, but since he never came across such a situation or his ability was never given a sort of fill up by others, he himself did not know	train
audio_0_69136.wav	But over the years what I have realized that what is over the case you need to do some sort of a treatment you can do a plasma cleaning, you can do an acid cleaning	train
audio_0_178951.wav	So, because of the gamma 1 scenario this will be equal to 1 minus probability of outage into C 2	train
audio_0_145056.wav	This is the profit or loss from continuing operation because there are no discontinued operations for this company	train
audio_0_38744.wav	At 0 at the origin right; and again it is like a wave, but it is decaying as I go away from it ok	train
audio_0_166452.wav	So, if you see the first case you, if you have a complex network where you have multiple mesh and nodes of level, then applying the node nodal or mesh analysis would be a little bit cumbersome	train
audio_0_134237.wav	The visual and auditory systems are exteroceptive systems	train
audio_0_189763.wav	You have seen how to delete a column, you can use negative symbol before the columns which you want to delete and then assign it to A you will see that the required output is printed	train
audio_0_213961.wav	instead, step it down to a reasonably close to what you need using this switching regulator and after that you do the conditioning right	train
audio_0_128662.wav	so there are no independent sources inside	train
audio_0_56728.wav	in this table we are showing the corresponding m z and m o values which we fix up at the beginning of the simulation	train
audio_0_47304.wav	Okay the normal operation is as discussed earlier	train
audio_0_48417.wav	so for r greater than r i have minus d v by d r is equal to q over four pi epsilon zero r square	train
audio_0_21659.wav	So, 20,000 units into 10	train
audio_0_213359.wav	so you can see, this is indeed the right schematic	train
audio_0_170061.wav	Now, we can also say that mass is analogous to inductance of electric network	train
audio_0_72823.wav	It was proposed by Kent Beck 1999	train
audio_0_187503.wav	So, 10 divided by 11 and you will get this number 0	train
audio_0_9534.wav	I hope you have understood this one right	train
audio_0_95049.wav	but then you, in order to be an effective speaker or effective presenter, please do not read the presentation, either with your notes or with your power point slides	train
audio_0_90904.wav	Second we need to overflow the buffer with this particular address so that the written address located on the stack is replaced by the address of system	train
audio_0_119606.wav	so fault tolerant in google file system	train
audio_0_134567.wav	But broadly for understanding we have the independent, the dependent and the extraneous variables	train
audio_0_48989.wav	do that point	train
audio_0_188157.wav	And I as I mentioned earlier this 5 are the attributes that tells about the condition of the car	train
audio_0_203596.wav	In that case from the top view this point a maps there; b and c coincides that is the reason b' c', o will be visible and there is a line which goes and joins that point	train
audio_0_123990.wav	otherwise it will follow the signal and it does that ok	train
audio_0_199414.wav	In other words, C3 is much greater than GM by omega, where omega is the signal frequency	train
audio_0_183811.wav	I have given you this connections, but how many of output should you observe before you can basically say now I can figure out the rest of the sequence	train
audio_0_122652.wav	So the imagery in this particular story is not there merely for effect	train
audio_0_185893.wav	So, since this is a linear constraint you will see that it is a line which is here which is what is given by this constraint	train
audio_0_68152.wav	So, flocking about Non adhering cells; adhering cells you could see these are all adhered to each other right in our hand	train
audio_0_215832.wav	so this is a very nice application which many companies are actually promoting	train
audio_0_222414.wav	So, in linear time, we are able to do breadth first search	train
audio_0_28199.wav	We can imagine that the intersections are numbered	train
audio_0_194809.wav	Now as was discussed earlier the fact that we have channel length modulation means that the operating point current also changes right because here we get VGS of 3 volts that doesn't change at all because the gate current is still 0 but for a gate voltage of 3 volts instead of the current being 200 microamperes it will be dependent on VDS as well and you can calculate it but like I mentioned usually we do operating point calculations without taking into account the effect of lambda VDS	train
audio_0_62546.wav	it is becoming thinner and thinner and sma, but when you open the laptop you will really be able to appreciate the amount and the kind of engineering that goes into the planning of the design	train
audio_0_30240.wav	So, we will extend this further and take it on to the, concept of how do we decide, what is normative behavior or so, called normal	train
audio_0_26042.wav	Supposing, we want to print out a table using a print statement, we want to make sure that the columns line up	train
audio_0_97280.wav	So, that is the basic idea of casting	train
audio_0_200483.wav	So, this implies saturation because VDS is more than VGS minus VT	train
audio_0_102756.wav	Here you see that in this the name of the operator is operator A, the type name, because it has to change A type	train
audio_0_66391.wav	Now second situation what I told you is called cell culture; the first one is tissue culture second one is called cell culture	train
audio_0_230141.wav	So, the flatness of this surface can be measured by using this interferometry technique	train
audio_0_198871.wav	The actual gate source voltage applied is smaller than the input voltage VS, but you can fix this situation by making R1 and R2 very large	train
audio_0_32428.wav	So, this is where all the CEM actions happen ok	train
audio_0_120498.wav	So he says that that's the problem with Gisou	train
audio_0_37466.wav	That current I mean when there is volt when there is current flowing through a wire and a resistor there would do you say that the voltage came first and then the current or current came first and then the voltage does not matter right	train
audio_0_121111.wav	And it is almost, the Premtion is almost making a satire of the society of Lucknow at that particular point	train
audio_0_181718.wav	So, it is always good for us to have finite bounds when we want to do a integration	train
audio_0_52566.wav	as i'll show here, divergence of h is equal to one over mu, zero divergence of b minus divergence of m	train
audio_0_235862.wav	The other thing, here is, you could have commitment oriented, career development efforts	train
audio_0_167042.wav	So here again, you have 2 equations, but you have 3 unknowns	train
audio_0_215082.wav	the second method is you have um only one side capability	train
audio_0_179641.wav	89, 0	train
audio_0_145797.wav	And for this purpose, let's say we use a solution like a semaphore	train
audio_0_203458.wav	So, first what I will do	train
audio_0_227024.wav	02 mm	train
audio_0_14859.wav	So, half L is 0	train
audio_0_52938.wav	so suppose we change this question to that we have a finite magnetic material or a sphere of magnetic material, and i put a point dipole at the center	train
audio_0_65100.wav	so this is local skew	train
audio_0_155845.wav	Cost wise, it is better if the outer relation is smaller	train
audio_0_19405.wav	Gifts are fixed cost	train
audio_0_64837.wav	so the cost will be six	train
audio_0_218431.wav	ok, switching regulator, basic idea	train
audio_0_218947.wav	So, x must be true and y must be true, either one of is false, x and y is false	train
audio_0_226437.wav	So but the thing is that the an interval the space is fixed here, ok	train
audio_0_122217.wav	So, you need to ask these questions such as how and why, why does a particular character behave in the way she or he does	train
audio_0_109434.wav	So, this is the genre there is a plot there is an even that happens and there are a set of characters all looking suspicious and there is a person who would come to solve that thing and eventually they could be some twist in the tale, eventually the crime is solved or at least the person who reads the novel is given an impression that he got he was a part of a process of solving something	train
audio_0_48668.wav	just one point: you may be wondering why i have kept sine k x minus omega t for both	train
audio_0_236051.wav	And, they are accountable	train
audio_0_232002.wav	So, There is a beautiful lake in the village as is given in the example, it refers to something in or at that place, that location, so there you remember the place	train
audio_0_99355.wav	What I am interested to highlight is, a fact that this function here I have written it as a global function	train
audio_0_191519.wav	So, immediately we know, hence what do, we know we know alpha is algebraic over Q	train
audio_0_77071.wav	So, there is very it is very difficult to find out which of these case applies to your protein	train
audio_0_115771.wav	say ten or twenty vms are active, whether ah it is, it is efficient to distribute over the whole ah vm servers available	train

audio_0_205207.wav	For example, if we have a square	train
audio_0_223884.wav	But we have now taken both options, we have included b 1 and excluded b 1, so it is more reasonable to expect that we have a either a solution with b 1 or without b 1, there are no third option, the solution either has b 1 and does not have b 1, we are trying to evaluate both and then we are trying to choose the best one	train
audio_0_55424.wav	ok, so now if i want to connect the pin this to a pin this, i do not have to find out the nearest node, but i have a node or vertex corresponding to this pin directly	train
audio_0_205853.wav	To describe about any picture, in the overall perspective we use projections	train
audio_0_220833.wav	So, in Dijskstra's algorithm, we start with the initial vertex and we keep burning these vertices, right, so we keep visiting vertices according to their distance	train
audio_0_197261.wav	In other words, p out is less than or equal to v1i1 in other words p out is less than or equal to p n okay now this is not very surprising okay this looks in fact like a roundabout way of saying that the device is dissipating power because we already said that the device is passive okay so that means it is dissipating power and remember there is no other source of power here	train
audio_0_160348.wav	Why are they not consistent	train
audio_0_31973.wav	It is a complex vector; so this is complex	train

audio_0_31639.wav	Now, so far I mean we started by saying that we are going to talk about integral equations but, so far there is no integral anywhere inside right	train
audio_0_206011.wav	Because we cannot show horizontal plane in the horizontal direction of a 2D sheet we make it below that vertical plane	train

audio_0_212986.wav	ok, let me now switch to ah the computer	train
audio_0_98326.wav	The same number of parameters, but the types of the parameters are different and based on that we are able to resolve as to what a particular call is talking about, what a particular from the call, what particular function of the different alternatives that have been overloaded needs to be actually invoked, need to be actually bound	train
audio_0_196845.wav	So although it is possible to play with the values of Y1 2 in order to maximize this expression, that depends on the precise values of GS and GL l and so on so we don't want to even get into that complication the safest alternative is when y1 2 is 0 that is internally there is no feedback if you apply a signal to port 1 it passes it on to port 2 but if you apply a signal to port 2 nothing comes to port 1 that's the safest one okay So then this disappears completely and in the denominator you will have only these terms which will be positive	train
audio_0_133460.wav	In the case of the tennis player is it the joy, is it pride, the sense that you have defeated somebody	train
audio_0_198816.wav	And again in the context of the MOSFET we don't use generic terminology like Y22	train

audio_0_35065.wav	I can extend this idea supposing now I do something like basis function a as a function of y	train
audio_0_20852.wav	So, instead of saying that you will achieve 1,000 units, so these are the costs, you will say that if 1,000 units is a sales, these are the costs, if 1,100 these are the cost	train
audio_0_196842.wav	Now the effect of this it turns out can be quite complicated because it depends on the values of GS and GL and so on	train
audio_0_30919.wav	So, this is element 1 2 3 4	train
audio_0_92582.wav	However, if we set N to just ln divided by ln, for instance, where this bracket function means rounding the integer towards the infinity	train
audio_0_20553.wav	Whereas if you produce 800 units, it will be 80,000 upon 800	train
audio_0_217304.wav	we could not measure temperature directly because that would be very difficult to do in a non invasive manner	train
audio_0_148024.wav	So, let us get the user underscore post permissions and there you go	train
audio_0_173650.wav	So what happens, if you want to improve you have to look at each one of them and to see how, what is it that I can do	train

audio_0_96928.wav	So, if we just see the dynamics, if I just draw them again this is p on this side of the program and this is the allocation	train
audio_0_70440.wav	That means if project project B is not completed maybe project A we may not start so that's why in order to handle this we must take into account the dependency between the projects which project is dependent on what other project accordingly we can assign the resources so that the project on which another project is dependent that should be finished as early as possible so that the other project which is dependent on it can be started then removing duplication between projects so if you are having similar projects if you are running similar projects and some components are redundant they are duplicated so it's unnecessarily use of effort and resources etc also unnecessary what waste time	train
audio_0_100637.wav	These are basic structure	train
audio_0_171658.wav	Now, suppose you are asked to find out the value of energy absorbed or supplied by some element from time t not to t how you will calculate	train

audio_0_83952.wav	So, what we write this is I b 1, I b 1 is 22 microampere	train
audio_0_3812.wav	So, basic understanding of these 3 functions helps to make sense of the first order circuit right	train
audio_0_43270.wav	So, sort of to summarize I had a let us say segment over here minus a to b, and there was there is a singularity sitting over here and what is happening is, I am going from here I am hitting the singularity right	train
audio_0_97491.wav	Now in the context of C++ this is an error, this is the compiler does not allow this	train
audio_0_114621.wav	we dont know whether there is a potential to extract rsa and aes secret keys of this cross channel, all this ah side channel	train
audio_0_70705.wav	Then we have to insert the value of TDI in this formula to find out the value of a VAAF that the value adjustment factor or complex factor	train
audio_0_21354.wav	So, using that formula, let us try to compute the BP	train
audio_0_139791.wav	So in this, so otherwise this program simply says that while you are in state 3, down solenoid will have to be activated very simple	train
audio_0_187512.wav	So, 9 by 9, which is 1, which is what you see here	train
audio_0_69787.wav	Where is the osmolarity which you needed for adult hippocampal culture is osmolarity of the medium is around 260 to 270 milliosmoles	train
audio_0_47753.wav	So the average value of the inductor current is I not and that is what will go through the ripple component of the inductance will go through the capacitance and there will be a ripple component here so let us place the ripple component here and see what after placing the ripple component here you see that the wave shape is like this just like as we had discussed during the time when Q is on the inductor is charging up and this charging up at rate is V in minus V0 by L and then the inductor is discharging during the time when it is off and it is discharging it is revealing like this and it is falling down at the rate of minus v0 by l and it keeps on repeating under steady state condition like a triangle and the one that is filled up here the colored filled up portion is the zero average portion and that is what will flow through the capacitance	train
audio_0_221493.wav	I can do both of them	train
audio_0_226041.wav	This will be a screw thread, but if you try to project at it forms a fundamental triangle, it is an image so, if you can go like this	train
audio_0_41976.wav	You can see if I take del dot a over here what am I going to get; I am going to get x plus partial with respect to y, partial with respect to z and as going to be equal to 3 right so, it is a non zero quantity	train
audio_0_158064.wav	On the other hand, you go to physicists who takes astronomy	train
audio_0_98120.wav	That is, you can convert an lvalue to an rvalue; that is, if you are using a variable just to a, in case you are not familiar with this terms, l value, l value is left value or basically the value of the variable	train

audio_0_212757.wav	i will now shift to the demonstration mode on ah, my laptop, and we will see quickly several demonstrations on how we are able to handle set security related things	train
audio_0_210270.wav	Similarly, there will be tree structures one has to be careful, something like what is the object, which surfaces are connected and each surface how many edges are there	train
audio_0_82907.wav	So, if you want to understand whether output voltage is 0 or not, and how much voltage we have to give at the output, then you have to do you have to connect the circuit, like this, now let us see the connect the circuit as shown in figure it is very easy, right	train
audio_0_191454.wav	So, unlike in the rings case we usually considered fields when in this fashion	train
audio_0_48720.wav	let us say there is no reflection	train
audio_0_7968.wav	So, basically if you sorry if you apply your KVL, it will be 16 into i 3 then encountering plus terminal plus 12 is equal to 0 therefore, i 3 is equal to minus 3 by 4 ampere	train
audio_0_191347.wav	So, under the assumption that I plus J is equal to R, show that the product is equal to the intersection	train

audio_0_158828.wav	So if you just take reads, of course, the reads or rights covers that read	train
audio_0_183615.wav	Now on the other hand if you had the lower speed no chance it will wipe out the entire	train
audio_0_14831.wav	So, half C is 20 into 10 to the power minus 3 farad and V 0 square, so 15 square it is 2	train
audio_0_164415.wav	So in this example if you see this the topology of one particular circuit is like this where a, c, b, d and a b are connected in this fashion and there is another circuit where you create the topology in this fashion where these elements are connected like this and third one where the circuits are connected in a triangular fashion	train
audio_0_140273.wav	So then what do we do, so we first, we can always multiply it by s +c by s + a, so where this is we are talking about zeros, so let this b only, so if you want to change the 0, we can always multiply it, so that this and this will get cancelled and we will get this, but this is not possible when you have a right half plane 0 because if it is s a by s +b then you cannot multiply it by s + c by s a and say that this is cancelled and it will give me, give me this because this transfer function is unstable	train
audio_0_150403.wav	In the Twitter space, increasing the in degree actually increases the gain; similarly, to show on my tweets on the search results	train
audio_0_208029.wav	Now, if we are moving to the second point to construct P 2 what we have to do is from A to 2 whatever the distance use that distance, but centre as F 1 make an arc on either side	train

audio_0_122029.wav	But an author can deliberately rearrange the events disregarding the time in which they have happened for particular purposes	train
audio_0_214784.wav	ok, because there can be many replacements of ah parts	train
audio_0_89423.wav	Now when the function or the gadget being executed executes the return instruction as we have said there are two things that would happen	train
audio_0_180920.wav	So, let me ask you a question what is the capacity of a cellular system that is designed in this fashion its infinity, but I can go on subdividing right I can go on dividing into smaller and smaller cells where is the price that I pay for that I will increase the number of base stations	train
audio_0_233592.wav	s conscious goals, or, it says that, an individual's conscious goals, or intentions, regulate his or her behavior	train
audio_0_96540.wav	actually, what is of utmost importance is people do not see it from the point of view of the receiver	train
audio_0_135053.wav	This requires more cognitive flexibility	train
audio_0_75817.wav	So, what they went on to see was to check that what is the spatial localization of some of the key proteins, actin associated proteins and what they found was Arp 2/3 which is associated with branching of actin it is present in the lamellipodia	train
audio_0_156899.wav	So why is BCNF normalization important is that if the area to district is actually introduces a problem	train
audio_0_104705.wav	I will tell you that you are trying to find typeid for something which cannot be found, and on that bad typeid there is some message that	train
audio_0_84733.wav	My SiO2 which is not protected by my photoresist will get etched, we will etched right easy	train
audio_0_204736.wav	So, when we are constructing this first of all based on the conditions, we have to visualize how the object might be looking	train
audio_0_39164.wav	Further, I notice the second equation has one more parameter that has come upon which is this guy lambda	train
audio_0_48701.wav	so if this is a direction of propagation x, and if e happens to be in the y direction, then b would be in the z direction	train
audio_0_59916.wav	now the sat problem, the question you ask, is that whether this set difference, s minus s capital t, is it empty	train
audio_0_41193.wav	So, can I apply this approach that I have discovered so far this surface integral approach can I use it to this kind of a problem	train
audio_0_37547.wav	We will come to it as you start calculating it will come to it ok	train
audio_0_47815.wav	so i am going to have unit vectors in direction r, like this, in direction theta, which is going to be in this plane containing the point and the z axis	train
audio_0_232372.wav	You were talking to Rajesh	train
audio_0_159335.wav	So first of all, so T1 is the schedule	train
audio_0_57424.wav	now here we are using some kind of gates	train
audio_0_170505.wav	So in that case what will happen that this linear two terminal circuit would be nothing but a dead circuit because there is no source available	train
audio_0_192353.wav	And later on once we start talking about homomorphisms of rings and some other properties of rings, you will see that whenever n is positive Z mod n Z cannot be realized as a sub ring of C	train
audio_0_40428.wav	And this guys points are x prime y prime z prime, but I am choosing these source points to be only on the surface of the because a current is purely a surface current, so x prime square plus y prime square is going to be equal to a square which is the radius	train
audio_0_131059.wav	so that will ah operate on nox particularly	train
audio_0_5358.wav	So, angle between the voltage as current is 53	train

audio_0_190981.wav	We cannot put infinitely many variables of course, then it will not be noetherian as we know, but finitely many variables it is noetherian and for this we need Hilbert basis theorem and how do we get this, this is simply because polynomial ring in n variables is simply a polynomial ring in one variable over the polynomial ring in n minus 1 variables	train
audio_0_198125.wav	The operating point here will be VGS, whatever the VGS is	train
audio_0_149700.wav	These are the interesting social networks that are there, first let us look at Facebook, I am assuming that many of you would have account in Facebook	train
audio_0_27094.wav	So, it is this is some point to keep in mind that there could be problems, where the complexity is bigger than the table size	train
audio_0_184722.wav	You are trying to achieve something which looks like an AWGN channel	train
audio_0_6359.wav	So, in this case what you can what you the way you want you can find out look, I am making in my way you have many other ways to find out V Thevenin	train
audio_0_181814.wav	So, in other words the maximum array gain possible is a factor of M and that is achieved by MRC	train
audio_0_36818.wav	Right so, if there is some facet which is angled at a certain way the wave will go off at the same time	train
audio_0_178167.wav	So, the first system let us say has got gain G1 with noise power N1 G2 N2 G3 N3	train
audio_0_51079.wav	so we are going to write it as one over c square	train

audio_0_229678.wav	So, here what I have done is I have converted this in my explanation I have said this can be your own industry for example, Maruti is an industry, Hyundai is an industry, they can have their own standards and their standards meet out only within the assembly within their product only, it cannot be generalized to other producer, right	train
audio_0_229869.wav	So, after the process is over so, the output comes	train
audio_0_200485.wav	05 volt inverse, what do I get	train
audio_0_84356.wav	So, let us go one by one, can you please stop the run and stop, all right I have done it	train
audio_0_67205.wav	These are light say orange; orange should be sitting here ok	train
audio_0_144680.wav	Then there can be other type of ratios which are known as turnover or activity ratios or efficiency ratios	train
audio_0_148444.wav	In tutorials this week, you will actually look at in detail about what a Facebook API is, how do you actually create the secret key, what kind of authentication that you will have to provide Facebook, in terms of collecting data, what data can be collected and things like that	train
audio_0_187971.wav	As a part of this, we are going to look at are there any bad measurements in the data	train
audio_0_137944.wav	So since the drain is at a low pressure, immediately pressure will fall	train
audio_0_118533.wav	like i am, i am able to access a data which are otherwise i am not able to access it	train
audio_0_155066.wav	The levels of formality which we want to maintain in our dialogue can also be communicated with the help of food and its associated practices	train
audio_0_195209.wav	And how do we sum two currents	train
audio_0_186820.wav	That is the beauty of this idea here	train
audio_0_78777.wav	So, in this way when the cell migrates just decoupling of B from A can allow A to again depolymerize or come off and re engage the outside and then as B connects you can have this dynamic turnover	train
audio_0_102618.wav	In terms of the module outline, I had explained in the last module itself that will cover spread over multiple modules	train
audio_0_142362.wav	There could be sale but it can be wrong also because please look there is a depreciation	train
audio_0_120991.wav	Now, in terms of reading the plotting of a particular story, and some of the questions that we need to ask are about the conflicts	train
audio_0_188806.wav	So, it might get negative mu in which case again this is not an optimum solution	train
audio_0_5257.wav	So next we we are back again, so, next parallel RLC circuit right, look whenever making it trying to cover each and everything, it will be it will be helpful for you right	train
audio_0_157134.wav	So essentially the transaction which has minimal effect on the other transaction in terms of cascading rollbacks is chosen	train
audio_0_113377.wav	So, a complex number can also be written instead of a plus j b form which is called rectangular form, it can also be expressed as a magnitude phase form	train
audio_0_194217.wav	So, I will leave the details for you, if f x is a non zero polynomial write it as a n x n plus whatever I do not care what the remaining terms are, and similarly g x is b n x n, b m I will write and I do not care	train
audio_0_71541.wav	When it was a manual system, it was taking to 20 minutes more for preparing the customer notices	train
audio_0_12396.wav	During the day, it is loaded as follows right it is because we have find out all day efficiency	train
audio_0_1605.wav	So, in this case you therefore, back emf is always less than the applied voltage, so although the difference is very small when the machine is running under normal conditions	train
audio_0_212168.wav	storage efficiency takes a beating because this register drops the voltage across itself and then does not allow you to charge	train
audio_0_201967.wav	And this pin surface has to be concentric concentric with this space	train
audio_0_80676.wav	Let us go to another point and that is your complementary metal oxide semiconductor	train

audio_0_33331.wav	So, graphically what is the second derivative; right, it is a it is the combination of the function evaluation at these three points ok	train
audio_0_183645.wav	So, if you now accept this can you redefine what is the snapshot at a given time	train
audio_0_165542.wav	So, therefore this system is not state controllable	train
audio_0_75192.wav	So, you purify you run on a gel and then you can probe it with the antibody to B to see if you get a band	train
audio_0_185701.wav	So, the distinction here is subtle, but I want you to remember this	train
audio_0_19464.wav	But in this case what is happening is the bus related costs are semi variable in nature and we are not including them in the variable cost	train
audio_0_83239.wav	I have values R1 R2 right	train
audio_0_78917.wav	The other term I used is remodel	train
audio_0_227353.wav	So, that means, this 4 mm is quite a large height to quite a large to make it move	train
audio_0_223005.wav	So, each of these cannot be extended to be the code of any other letter	train
audio_0_44324.wav	So, the field at some point over here r prime is written as a sum of the incident field and this term over here which is a surface integral again and that surface integral includes phi and grad phi which are E tan H tan on the surface	train
audio_0_28461.wav	So, we might have an abstract compare function, which returns minus 1 if the first argument is smaller, zero if the 2 arguments are equal, and plus 1 if the first argument is bigger than the second	train
audio_0_110204.wav	Basically, you know this famous equation that gamma reflection coefficient is equal to Z with a bar that is normalized impedance minus 1 by Z bar plus 1	train

audio_0_225781.wav	Again, traveling salesman with the bounded version, we can take a set of a given path, check it is a simple cycle, add up the weights and verify that the bound is satisfied, likewise vertex cover and independent set	train
audio_0_94579.wav	and when the purpose becomes a specific, we have to see that you do not speak something that goes against some belief or against some faith	train
audio_0_62296.wav	now i am trying to find out under what conditions can the output value change to one	train
audio_0_187447.wav	So, if all of these are identified as positive by the classifier, there is a proportion of this, which is correct	train
audio_0_36935.wav	Yeah in if I have yeah	train
audio_0_49155.wav	what we are going to say is that by symmetry, this charge produces a sigma which depends only on r from the line joining the plane	train
audio_0_206597.wav	So, parallel to that if we are marking this will be 39	train
audio_0_221214.wav	So, in other words, if I have W 0, then it says all of the vertices 1 to n cannot appear on the paths, so the only way that we can have such a shortest paths is to the direct edge	train
audio_0_211773.wav	gone are the days where humans were human action or human, human triggered events was generating traffic on the internet	train

audio_0_178598.wav	So, your gamma MRC will grow linearly as the number of antennas	train
audio_0_93239.wav	now, in order to see how we use, let us look at these sentences and you will find ah that even though the sentence means, even though meaning is there in the sentence, but when we come to check the correctness level, we will find that something is wrong	train
audio_0_5554.wav	So, same as before, if you write the your KVL equations, for the for these one later it is written	train
audio_0_154507.wav	The person who has opted for the third position C is rather picky and choosy in terms of personal choices; for example, the type of shoes, the type of clothes, the perfumes one wears etcetera the person would be rather choosy about it	train
audio_0_32519.wav	So, we are not going to go to the magnetic field we are going to go the second route to the electric field ok	train
audio_0_117773.wav	then it has some definition	train
audio_0_17183.wav	So, 17 by 9 ampere and i 4 is equal to 2 v 3 so, 2 into minus 13 by 9 so, minus 26 by 9 ampere right	train
audio_0_204084.wav	Align these two in the rail track	train

audio_0_116872.wav	right, what will be the performance	train
audio_0_186299.wav	So, we have assigned a value of 6 to x, we are checking if x is greater than 7 because your value is 6 and we are checking a condition 6 is greater than 7 which is false this statement will not be executed	train
audio_0_62644.wav	because, we said, this is very important: when you design a clock network, the main objective is to minimize the clocks skew as much as possible up to the terminal points	train
audio_0_38810.wav	So, that is the most I mean it is not absolutely the golden rule, but this is the by further most common way for doing FEM is you choose the testing and basis functions to be the same ok	train
audio_0_194483.wav	So, ab is equal to 0, but if two integers give you two product of two integers is 0 then one of a or b must be 0 maybe both are 0, but I do not care, one of them is 0	train
audio_0_191271.wav	So, the previous argument is critically dependent on the fact that R is finite	train
audio_0_166780.wav	So, how to solve, we will first try to find out the currents I1 and I2	train

audio_0_161931.wav	That means all transactions that started earlier, the two things are checked	train
audio_0_105433.wav	But it does allow us that we can now create our collection of employees as in employee array of employee pointer, earlier we were doing with array of engineer point	train
audio_0_62763.wav	so for that, possibly, i will need some additional corridors for places to work and reach their approach	train
audio_0_72318.wav	The spiral model is also called as a meta model because a single loop of the spiral is a waterfall model	train
audio_0_207045.wav	To hold it, we use this clip arrangement ; to hold it tightly, we require these clips, sometimes people use pins also	train
audio_0_191.wav	So, as applied to control charts on production this means that it is of vital importance not to lose track of the order of production, because control chart only an assist technology and you have to remember that the final goal is really the output of the production control chat can only be a subdomain information collection system, which should not really zoopathies the main couse which is really the high level of production at the particular centre	train
audio_0_121899.wav	One major interpretation that kind of jumps at me is that the heroes escape, Pratap Singh's escape with his lady love or with a central female character parallels their escape, that is the escape of Meini and her father into the relationship with the Kabaliwala	train
audio_0_81471.wav	So, I am just quickly moving on the to the next slide after discussing this slide so that we understand what was the theory class and we can correlate with the experimental class	train
audio_0_92188.wav	And this R prime t will be evaluated, the dot product will be integrated over dt the single integral which we have learned and the t will vary for instance, whatever t goes from A to B depending on the problem	train
audio_0_225846.wav	We are going to look at SAT and say that SAT actually you can reduce to independent set, which is the little bit more surprising, because they seen come from variable different domains	train
audio_0_202741.wav	So, at 20 mm height we mark a’ above XY we are in the first quadrant	train
audio_0_191688.wav	We take a polynomial and we just view this mod p, right	train
audio_0_40676.wav	So, everyone who is done you know 1st year of engineering whether it is a you know double E, EP or whatever have seen singles and systems	train
audio_0_102547.wav	So, when you have a template function instantiation say an implicit instantiation then there is again the same question of binding which we had to answer in case of overloading which we had to answer in case of dynamic polymorphism we again have to answer that	train
audio_0_18505.wav	I have missed it	train
audio_0_92910.wav	Also, there are continuous functions, even we have those functions whose Fourier series diverges at a countable number of points	train
audio_0_130591.wav	this is a magnetic field, ok, so lets look at this configuration	train
audio_0_202668.wav	And our usual notation is any line making inclination angle with the horizontal plane, we represent it by theta this is standard notation	train
audio_0_29181.wav	Remember was checking when we say l 1 is l 2, we are checking whether l 1 and l 2 point to the same list object	train
audio_0_139662.wav	On the other hand the manual controls may be near the equipment at the field, so the possibility of including such manual controls must be examined	train
audio_0_140458.wav	you may, you may close the switch for very small points of time, so you get these values, of the various see, these are the samples, while this could be for channel number one, channel number two, channel number three and channel number four and then again channel number one, so you have these four channels, but at the output of the hold circuit, you will find that this value zero is being held up, till the value is sense to, again the hold circuit is instructed that, now you release that held value and now acquire new value so by the time can the next channel switch has been put on and the value has stabilized there so now the hold circuit senses the new value and then again holds it for the next interval, so it holds it for the next interval then again it senses the new value and then again holds it, so this is what happens by a sample and hold right	train
audio_0_166900.wav	RL would be equal to under root of Rth square plus Xth square	train
audio_0_18425.wav	This is the current will be in phase in the voltage right	train

audio_0_225867.wav	So, if I have four clauses and if I insist on the size are the independent set being the number of process, then I would definitely have got one witness per literal	train
audio_0_59856.wav	so for this case, as soon as we reduce the delay for the same input values, same input transition, the delay is be showing at four	train
audio_0_63897.wav	now a simple latch that uses gates is shown here	train
audio_0_183204.wav	So, this is what tells us what portion of the transmitted signal power can be effectively intercepted	train

audio_0_53728.wav	what it means is that as it moves it remains pity must the same	train
audio_0_75267.wav	So, to look at this in greater detail what they did was they tracked, they correlated fret index with focal adhesion size	train
audio_0_72230.wav	So the requirements change due to various reasons and we need a model which can effectively handle requirement changes	train
audio_0_132492.wav	ah, typically in cold countries we are talking about, lets say, an indoor swimming pool, ok, or in a hotel	train
audio_0_58014.wav	for d equal to three, you can have six possibilities	train
audio_0_126820.wav	for instance, here i think of this case as super position of two cases, one in which i one and v three are active and the other one in which only v two is active	train
audio_0_100974.wav	It is easy to understand as to why this should be reference because if this were not a reference, then you will unnecessarily require a copy construction to happen and then the assignment will happen	train
audio_0_72115.wav	The key roles are the product owner development team and the scrum master	train
audio_0_25981.wav	And, this is achieved using the print statement, which we have seen occasionally, informally, without formally having defined it	train
audio_0_174485.wav	So through all this we are bringing lot of load on the project itself	train
audio_0_229215.wav	Those are sorry attributes, variables can be length then variable can be weight all those continuous data that we have discussed ok	train
audio_0_89009.wav	Since the path is different, the choice between which of these 2 signals is faster may also be different, and therefore the output of the PUF may also change	train
audio_0_225994.wav	Pitch diameter is from centre of the coaxial of the axis you will see through this point, we call it as the pitch diameter, ok	train
audio_0_101353.wav	So, if within the function, I try to write something like plus plus x	train
audio_0_219946.wav	So, we have an extra variable, we have b and h which are as before barfi and halwa and r for rasmalai, so we can get 100 rupees per box of barfi, 600 rupees per box of halwa and 1300 per box of rasmalai	train
audio_0_138754.wav	So obviously they use sensors which are also discrete that is they like you know limit switches just sense whether something is in this position or that position, pressure switch sensors whether the pressure is high or low, photo switch sensors whether a part is placed on the conveyor belt or not	train
audio_0_188771.wav	However, I have 5 variables that I need to compute, I need to compute a value for x 1, I need to compute a value for x 2 and then I need to compute mu 1, mu 2 and mu 3	train
audio_0_70164.wav	So, I will have a little bit more of working bench like here	train

audio_0_153500.wav	If you work in seconds then you need to adapt otherwise you are going to set yourself up for a lot of resistance from your hosts and you are going to get constant disappointment	train
audio_0_192715.wav	So, this is a bit involved this proof it uses several facts	train
audio_0_11930.wav	So, this is theta is equal to omega t	train
audio_0_121035.wav	And the reason as to why he goes to the Chetya shop, as I just mentioned, is because he has more financial woes and Chetya understanding the financial troubles of Ravutha exploits the situation and asks him to come and work at his shop instead so that he could use the calculation skills of this blind man and he also promises him that he would pay all his debts	train
audio_0_9514.wav	So, basically from that you can find out actually y axis is v t	train
audio_0_95175.wav	once you have talked about the introductory paragraph, then you will come to the body of the letter where you will explain about the product	train

audio_0_211895.wav	communication is a must communication, let me complete this, ok, which means: whatever be the ah vendor, whichever is the vendor, whoever is the vendor, with whatever protocol that he comes up with, he should be the sensor, should be able to talk to each other	dev
audio_0_224855.wav	So, we have already partition the values of the smaller values are to the left	dev
audio_0_199323.wav	You want to maximize the current that goes into this, consequently the power that is delivered to RL	dev
audio_0_26550.wav	So, how much time do all these take well if you examined the thing carefully you would realize that in every case we are just walking down one path searching for the value and along that path either we find it or we go down to the end and then we stop	dev
audio_0_66486.wav	I have seen over the years in common facilities you have a gas facility and you know people who are using it forget to figure out that gas is depleted and the cells die these are very common day to day problem and trust me this happens and it creates it creates leads to	dev
audio_0_121068.wav	Some were engrossed in dance and music, some just reveled in the drowsiness induced by opium	dev
audio_0_223819.wav	Likewise, when we actually do insertion sort, we give it the input X1 to Xn and we ask to sort X2 to Xn	dev
audio_0_206929.wav	And, in the next class, we will learn about how to do these isometric projections for solid objects	dev
audio_0_130583.wav	what is magneto hydro dynamics	dev
audio_0_218287.wav	i am sure you know how to calculate that	dev
audio_0_79294.wav	So, you fluorescently label this proteins and then image using super resolution microscopy	dev
audio_0_178216.wav	Now that point of intersection between the green line and the purple line what does that tell you, if I am a mobile sitting at that distance from I am equidistant from both base stations assuming both are transmitting in the same power level I am receiving this base station signal with the same power as this base station this is desired signal this is interference I have no idea what this base station is talking about what is my signal to impairment ratio	dev
audio_0_26995.wav	So, this is my M 1 prime and this is my M 2 prime, and this k is somewhere between 1 and n	dev

audio_0_132251.wav	for counter flow, the following expression is obtained: this is between effectiveness and ntu	dev
audio_0_87795.wav	In order to actually run this these set of instructions in a correct manner or what is expected is that each of these instructions execute in precisely this order	dev
audio_0_176675.wav	That is what is alignment	dev
audio_0_202561.wav	Parts with small tolerances often requires greater inspection and call for rejection of parts, how much care we might be going to take to care such kind of small tolerances, end of the day it has to go through inspection	dev
audio_0_239113.wav	It is always nice to tell them ahead of time, what is expected of them	dev
audio_0_140910.wav	For example studies have proven that the Japanese they usually Mask their negative emotions with smiley okay so you keep a neutral expression on the face and if at all you have to express negativity say for example if you have to show sadness okay you try to mask your expression with certain degree of a smile whereas in the case of oriental Indians it has been realized that we de intensified the negative emotions	dev
audio_0_111048.wav	Now VSWR circle we have plotted on the Smith Chart	dev
audio_0_145444.wav	Now let's do the analysis for avoidance related inversion for the same example problem	dev

audio_0_11596.wav	So, it is going to this phase I a	dev
audio_0_80565.wav	So, let us first see voltage at non inverting terminal, voltage at the inverting terminal 0	dev
audio_0_213145.wav	so what is the big takeaway	dev
audio_0_72367.wav	These are the different types of programs	dev
audio_0_119167.wav	and these are the different components	dev
audio_0_132594.wav	ok, so with that, with that example, we will conclude this lecture and in the next one we will take off from here and probably look at one or two more examples	dev
audio_0_121323.wav	So, there are connections between their actions and the events that before that we fall on Vajid Ali Shah	dev
audio_0_220287.wav	But, the diagonal of this square of size d by 2 is square root of d by 2, so this is some points 0	dev

audio_0_174087.wav	This is related to our earlier activity of writing outcomes	dev
audio_0_100767.wav	Because you cannot it in the stack because you do not know for how long you will need to maintain this object	dev
audio_0_112099.wav	So, that source impedance and input impedance Z they should be conjugately related also in the output side the load impedance and the output impedance, they should be conjugately related then between load and impedance matching network	dev
audio_0_41314.wav	So, we are inside element #a	dev
audio_0_29314.wav	We are not allowed to exploit what is inside the box in order to quickly get access say to the middle of a stack or the middle of a queue	dev
audio_0_57689.wav	so maybe we are splitting outputs across these	dev
audio_0_96373.wav	i know when you are writing a circular, once again, here, in the top centre you lie the name of the organization and below that you will lie the circular, and then you will write ah what is a the content of the circular and below that you will put your signature	dev
audio_0_203186.wav	Now from these labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of the circle; extend the lines which are going to generate lines on the cones	dev

audio_0_148202.wav	So, apt get is a command line package management tool for Ubuntu, which is used to install, remove, and manage software packages	dev
audio_0_18851.wav	Therefore, whatever it comes; that means, it will be ; that means, if I draw the equivalent circuit of this one, suppose, then I have only one , your 100 volt source and one resistance is like this, forget about this part	dev
audio_0_94899.wav	now, now, this is a fact, but at the same time, when we a representing it with the presentation, our inner speech, it actually rages not only the curiosity level, but then it sustains throughout the attention of your reader, of of your audience members	dev
audio_0_192769.wav	Similarly, we know that if characteristic this is covered here, but if characteristic of R is ok	dev
audio_0_12513.wav	So, if I write here i 0 plus i x these two currents are entering into the node is equal to this 2 i x plus V 0 by 4, these are living as per this current source your first loss	dev

audio_0_220030.wav	Sometimes they will refer to names of the elements themselves	dev
audio_0_60706.wav	now in this diagram i have said that i start with a vertical cut in the middle, but actually this middle is just for illustrations purposes, it is not exactly the middle	dev
audio_0_166968.wav	So you will see that poles of this particular transfer functions are lying at the imaginary axis	dev
audio_0_102958.wav	Or in other words, basically this assert at the compile time will get removed in the build code the build code will actually not have that assert because this is done based on the n debug	dev
audio_0_166579.wav	So, in short we can write the Y parameter equation of overall network is the summation of Y parameter matrix of individual sub networks	dev
audio_0_238712.wav	We talked about, what human resources is	dev

audio_0_189487.wav	So, now let us predict this on the test data	dev
audio_0_115819.wav	but if, if, ah overall ah, if i am achieving efficiency or in terms of power consumption, then ah, that may be a good option to look at	dev
audio_0_230898.wav	So, that is 110 in to 100000 which is 0	dev
audio_0_58506.wav	and there is another observation we made: test generation is lower than fault simulation	dev
audio_0_38762.wav	The waves that satisfy our differential equation are just a linear combination of J naught and Y naught, and why did we choose that linear combination	dev

audio_0_172685.wav	That is the difference	dev
audio_0_68226.wav	As such say a blue colony, red colony, green colony, ta green colony, orange colony, pink colony, fade blue colony this is good enough, and each one of these colonies I have different you know cells which governs them right these are the different cells	dev
audio_0_208711.wav	So, the first question is how to construct such kind of spirals on sheets	dev
audio_0_89638.wav	So, a similarly by EX ORING again the output 8 with that same key you re obtain 5	dev
audio_0_118339.wav	so this is one of the important core field	dev
audio_0_61653.wav	but, however, if you find that you make a move but the cost is increasing so it is not that you will always be rejecting such a move so you can reject that move, but that move will be accepted with a probability that decreases with the number of iterations	dev
audio_0_205907.wav	In the case of pictorial drawing, it gives us directly the object visualization, though the dimensions other things slightly skewed at least on two d sheet, it straight away gives us visualization of that object	dev

audio_0_46100.wav	325 volts is what we have given	dev
audio_0_122629.wav	She writes so beautifully, so her language is very lucid, yet you can understand what is happening there	dev
audio_0_180463.wav	So, that is a desirable element to have, but on the other hand if you have frequency selective fading, then you would have to have some form of equalization, which led us to the following terminology that channels may be flat or selective in time	dev
audio_0_86472.wav	This demo and the source code is actually present in a virtualbox which you can actually download	dev
audio_0_195477.wav	The only thing is there is now a voltage division between the actual input source VI and the gate terminal of the MOS transistor	dev

audio_0_168708.wav	Let us take first the example in case of h parameters	dev
audio_0_114194.wav	So, all these are systematic errors that means, errors in various assumptions we made and while implemented that assumptions we did not keep that is called systematic errors random errors we cannot say noise etcetera, they give random errors and drift errors after sometime the performance degrades	dev
audio_0_205640.wav	So, whatever we see that is the only thing what we show it	dev
audio_0_102903.wav	What helps you there is in case of error possibly you will have lot of code to take care of lot of things to may be certain objects which need to be deleted which need to be destructed and so on, all these you can take care of at one place you do not need to copy that code it multiple places	dev
audio_0_56894.wav	so i can distinguish between the two zeros and two ones with respect to whether they are the first zero or the first one	dev
audio_0_12705.wav	So, 18 ohm and this one and 2 terminal is like this, this is 1 this is 2 right; that means, let me clear it; that means, 3 ohm and 60 ohm this two are in series and 6 ohm and 30 ohm they are in series	dev
audio_0_38396.wav	We should approximate the second derivatives by finite differences, and see what kind of relation results from it ok	dev

audio_0_24536.wav	Technologically do you find any, so I heard an interesting I am pulling words out of your mouth I do not know why I do that always as always even in class I used to that	dev
audio_0_184658.wav	4 ok	dev
audio_0_26895.wav	So, what it is this saying, so when you say for l in a string it goes to each letter in that string, so want to say d with key a is the value a, d with the key b is the value b and so on right	dev
audio_0_6957.wav	When R tends to infinity, but when it is short circuit when you short it suppose these 2 terminals are shorted	dev
audio_0_61564.wav	now you may see it will ah, this actually doesnt show, but these may be	dev
audio_0_185779.wav	Now I also said this algorithm with minor modifications can be used for function approximation	dev
audio_0_92045.wav	Or another approach it could be that the given integral, so the second approach could be that the given integral we can write as 3 z square plus z over this z plus 1 all together and then we can replace z minus 1 and then dz	dev

audio_0_153303.wav	These are those micro and macro signals which illustrate what we want to say	dev
audio_0_154951.wav	Because it is thought that understanding of difficult or more technical part of the presentation require better understanding and more focus	dev
audio_0_46023.wav	But the real test is when you put them into the hardware physical hardware and realize the actual waveforms and results on the real hardware so use the simulation and simulation results with a pinch of salt and use it for understanding and design purposes	dev
audio_0_145515.wav	Or in other words words the utilization is not really fully balanced by using this greedy algorithm and the utilization balancing algorithm is used in the conjunction of EDF the allocation is done by the utilization balancing algorithm, but the individual processor scheduling is done by the EDF algorithm	dev
audio_0_184864.wav	So, again this is a very useful form if you take C by B which is a normalized capacity then it is the unit are bit is per second per hertz otherwise it would be in bit is per second, Gamma is in SNR a dimension less quantity	dev
audio_0_149498.wav	Assuming that we recorded the number of followers for each month of the year, we can represent it using a line chart	dev
audio_0_190164.wav	So, now all you need to do is combine like terms	dev

audio_0_28427.wav	There is no way in this function to say that, 16 should be given for d, and I want the default value for c; you can only drop values by position from the end	dev
audio_0_206694.wav	Once it is done from B, drop a perpendicular once 3 is also known drop a perpendicular, from A drop a perpendicular	dev
audio_0_62981.wav	this is structural and this is physical or geometric domain	dev
audio_0_145484.wav	The main reason is that the priority of a task on acquiring a resource does not change until a higher priority task requests the resource	dev
audio_0_226959.wav	Also we have two pointers, two pointers inside; one is the main pointer one is the small pointer	dev
audio_0_83418.wav	So, when this condition occurs, then the resonancet will start occurring	dev
audio_0_154712.wav	These associations have also been supported by research	dev
audio_0_41198.wav	So, many different surface integrals each of those I will have to solve put boundary conditions and solve it that is one approach, but that will break down if for example, my my material has some continuous variation in refractive in refractive index permittivity whatever you want to call it right	dev
audio_0_131511.wav	it is given that the turbine output, in this case, and when turbine, it is a peaking turbine is fifteen hundred megawatt hour, right	dev
audio_0_131893.wav	that, how it did, gives the limits of conversion	dev
audio_0_30876.wav	So, I leave it at that when we actually take a concrete 1 D problem you will see which one to do both are correct yes ok	dev
audio_0_236092.wav	As far as, ethics are concerned, various stakeholders are shareholders	dev
audio_0_209965.wav	Similarly, if a line is touching the vertical plane the intersection point either that or the extension point that is what we call trace of a line on vertical plane, and usually we denote it by VP VT	dev
audio_0_102417.wav	And we will see in terms going to C++ there will be a lot of ramifications of this concept of union C++ does provide us with a very strong feature based on object orientation something known as inheritance and specialization	dev
audio_0_213661.wav	ok, the authors are d dani d a n i, danilo d donno and others	dev
audio_0_176423.wav	C is more efficient and so on	dev
audio_0_224075.wav	For the visa, you need both the ticket and the insurance to be available and without a visa, the bank will not give you foreign exchange	dev
audio_0_68991.wav	So, this is a form of myelination what you see in the central nervous system neuron	dev
audio_0_101361.wav	At the time of call the value of a will be available as a value of x	dev
audio_0_119772.wav	so computing enables ah companies or enterprises applications which ah our system infrastructure independent, to be infrastructure free	dev
audio_0_63057.wav	your sum inputs x and y, or all four bit numbers that you represent here in terms of the array notation, three, colon zero means x and y, or two arrays whose index values can go from zero to three	dev
audio_0_70021.wav	So, that interaction is going to be missing and some of these interactions are survival instant concept or survival therapies for them, they survival because they crosstalk they interact	dev
audio_0_99703.wav	This is just to show you that these kinds of things can be done you can have multiple parameters and partially specialize them as you go from one to the other and you can have default parameters also	dev
audio_0_28723.wav	So, I get one plus that and the base case of the boundary condition is when one of the two words is empty right	dev
audio_0_12445.wav	So, copper loss will be 12	dev
audio_0_119451.wav	there is a thing called data object storage or dos	dev
audio_0_51129.wav	in particular we focused on wave propagating in the x direction and wrote this as: e x t is equal to e zero sin of k x minus omega t and be x t is equal to b zero sin of a x minus omega t	dev
audio_0_206655.wav	So, at those locations draw two lines parallel to this one, let us call this point as something E	dev
audio_0_104595.wav	So, p A being, so I am again doing a downcast, I am again bringing it down and I will have p B now try to point to this A	dev
audio_0_64729.wav	we carry our cluster in a hierarchical way	dev
audio_0_237167.wav	So, it is more of a machine like, a kind of design, you know	dev
audio_0_224179.wav	So, we first set the indegree to minus 1 for this particular vertex	dev
audio_0_70663.wav	So these are two inputs I have shown	dev
audio_0_223883.wav	So, we eliminate all the conflicting requests as we did in the greedy case and then we have another sub problem which is not necessarily b 2 to b N, it will be some subset of b 2 to b N	dev
audio_0_81943.wav	So, this fluctuating because he is holding with hand, in reality you do not have to hold with hand	dev
audio_0_75204.wav	So, what has been shown that the efficiency of this transfer of energy you can have this decrease as r to the 6 power	dev
audio_0_63916.wav	that requires a single transistor for its implementation and you can have a transmission gate which consists of two transistors, one p type and one n type	dev
audio_0_57674.wav	in our last lecture, if we recall, we talked about two techniques: gate sizing and buffering, introducing buffering interconnection lines	dev
audio_0_228629.wav	So, what we have actually do not have the true value, we just know that is some true value, and what we are generating the data which we were generating is the estimate; is the estimate of the true value	dev
audio_0_121396.wav	And finally, I want to talk about Tago's claims about realism in the context of his short stories	dev
audio_0_188519.wav	Now, for the residual plot, I am going to plot fitted values on the x axis and the standardized residual from the model we have built	dev

audio_0_92785.wav	So, the partial derivative of F 1 with respect to z if we compute we will get only y because first term does not have z	dev
audio_0_26480.wav	So, insert ninety one has no effect on this tree	dev
audio_0_190171.wav	So, what would be the general formula for multiplication	dev
audio_0_178769.wav	You do not want to compute noise variances you want to	dev
audio_0_102458.wav	And we can use a casting which is forcibly to be done by the programmer to cast that to integer type value	dev
audio_0_165512.wav	Because this state variable is not controllable by the input u t	dev
audio_0_206656.wav	So, B prime and this is E prime	dev
audio_0_197286.wav	So, you may be familiar with solving nonlinear equations, you may be familiar with methods like bisection method or Newton Rapson iteration and so on	dev
audio_0_174175.wav	That means first thing is it should be independent of other CO	dev
audio_0_130996.wav	there could be some variation, but i have given some sort of emotional values	dev
audio_0_202978.wav	So, 152 mm again we will see	dev
audio_0_186792.wav	So, this is an important thing to remember	dev
audio_0_86598.wav	Any one of these is sufficient for the attacker to get access into your system and therefore control your entire system or steal secret data that is present in the system	dev
audio_0_147635.wav	Next, let us run the average weighted degree	dev
audio_0_30550.wav	This is the how much it diverges and I have to do this integration over the volume because there could be lots and lots of taps right	dev
audio_0_147466.wav	So, in general, actually in the last two years or so social media has been used for crime prevention	dev
audio_0_84068.wav	1 to 1 or to 10, I can keep on changing the value of R 2 I can keep on changing value of R 2 because I have gain which is R 2 by R 1, right	dev
audio_0_100279.wav	The difference is made by this key word before the function	dev
audio_0_59505.wav	so it takes ah segment of a given net list between two storage or flip flop stages	dev
audio_0_40858.wav	So, when will I call the set of vectors a basis for a vector space	dev
audio_0_48428.wav	this, by divergence theorem, is integral d dot d s, which is equal to rho free d v, which is the total charge q	dev

audio_0_145612.wav	There is another example here	dev
audio_0_203913.wav	So, then click ok	dev
audio_0_178313.wav	So, I am assuming all of my multi path components are arriving around the same time	dev
audio_0_79635.wav	So, at point A, whatever you measure or whatever you estimate has effects of the underlying substrate	dev
audio_0_25314.wav	So as I said, this relies on the assumption that if they had less deadlines, they would sleep early and if they slept early, they would wake up early and if they wake up early, they are on time for the class	dev
audio_0_105127.wav	We have looked at how to overload operators using global functions and member functions	dev
audio_0_149916.wav	Many of such tools were used in this particular research to find out the location of the check ins, location of tips, and other information that was collected	dev
audio_0_74457.wav	So, I would like to imagine the cell as a tent	dev
audio_0_95948.wav	like that i mean there is no need of writing a lot in the beginning because people do not have time and it it may rather confuse them more	dev
audio_0_203908.wav	So, let us look at that also	dev
audio_0_209073.wav	Now, here we have certain angles I can always make 90 degrees and this one also 90 degrees	dev
audio_0_132429.wav	ok, so then what happens is the efficiencies will be different	dev
audio_0_135529.wav	And this kept on going till slavery was banned in the West in the 1830’s and the slave trade from Africa ended	dev
audio_0_61676.wav	as i said, we use a variable t indicating the temperature to initialize t, some large value, like the example i said, hundred thousand	dev
audio_0_121744.wav	So, the human spirit is back within Rau Ther	dev
audio_0_4433.wav	625 volt this will be the average value right	dev
audio_0_159156.wav	So ID, it's a prime attribute, so nothing to be done	dev
audio_0_159809.wav	So note that these are not natural joints any further	dev
audio_0_88062.wav	Now the output of F is fed back through this multiplexer and gets latched in this register	dev
audio_0_63815.wav	this is one of the very commonly used and popular technique for reducing power	dev
audio_0_93572.wav	now, what do i mean by planning	dev
audio_0_166717.wav	Because I1 enters the doted terminal of the coil 1 and V2 is positive at the doted terminal of coil 2	dev
audio_0_58027.wav	so once you do it, you only are left with e, so which is relatively mean weekly connected, two and one	dev
audio_0_155836.wav	Again, the same principle is applied	dev
audio_0_197762.wav	So that's how you choose C1, you just have to make sure that the reactiveness of that capacitor C1 is much smaller than RS plus R1 parallel R2	dev
audio_0_76909.wav	So, the perturb tension using, you have ROCK, Rho Kinase is one of the signaling pathways which directly mediates Cytoskeletal Tension	dev

audio_0_17622.wav	If you simplify right	dev
audio_0_98265.wav	Now, all of this follows the same algorithm for multiplication, but if I want to express them, code them in C language, I will need to provide all different names	dev
audio_0_236073.wav	Or, do they want everything, to be done, right	dev
audio_0_69998.wav	If you do offer a mechanical shearing or mechanical dissociation what you obtain is again the same thing what we talked about here a single cell suspension, but the single cell suspension in this case goes through 2 processes you first did a papain processing followed by a mechanical dissociation	dev
audio_0_201330.wav	VGS could be more than VT but if VDS is 0 this entire number is 0 and the current will be 0 and that is a useful thing to remember also	dev
audio_0_6867.wav	And germanium 47 into 10 to the power minus 2 it is a semiconductor	dev
audio_0_39450.wav	So, what follows now is, little bit of algebra only ok	dev
audio_0_19855.wav	2 will be the normal selling price	dev
audio_0_139989.wav	This course has two terms industrial automation and industrial control so he will be able to understand what are the similarities and differences between these two terms	dev
audio_0_117721.wav	it cannot be compromised less than ninety nine percent	dev
audio_0_223618.wav	So, you have one set of vertices 1 to 5 and then, you have to permutation of the vertices 1 to 5 listed in the order of your friends ranking	dev
audio_0_11445.wav	Suppose, this is a, this is b, this is c right, no N point is involved here	dev
audio_0_222494.wav	Now, because it is a tree, if I have an edge from i to j, there cannot be any other path going from i to j by some other edges, because if not that path plus this edge would form a cycle	dev
audio_0_142065.wav	They include bank overdraft, they include payables or creditors, they include variety of outstanding expenses	dev
audio_0_217368.wav	so the idea really is, when you talk about the design for internet of things, you have to keep in mind the application	dev
audio_0_93163.wav	but even if you have it, let it appear to be having a sort of decorum if, if you have a beard, if you have some hair on your face and you want to have it, let it see, ah, let it be seen that they are properly trimmed	dev
audio_0_96025.wav	so maintain a sort of curtsey and have consideration	dev
audio_0_176438.wav	Generation is it can be classifying systems, concepts, models, theories, explanations, generalization, hypothesis, predictions, principles, problems, questions, and stories	dev
audio_0_121929.wav	So, when he is sitting in the studio in front of the writing table, there's no fear, there's only camaraderie, there's only friendship in some ways, but when the father returns from his visit to the town, when he returns to the house, and if he sees the huge Afghan, huge Afghan, sitting in a corner of the house in the dark of the evening, in the evening when it's dimly lit, when there's hardly any light left out, natural life left out, in his baggy clothes, in his huge clothes, in his capacious clothes and with his customary sack, that particular image would create a sudden fear in my mind	dev
audio_0_236340.wav	So, it could be something, as simple as that	dev
audio_0_164547.wav	So we will again use the nodal analysis	dev
audio_0_190084.wav	So, I told you what those are these are expressions of the form	dev
audio_0_206650.wav	So, from rightward direction we are trying to locate it in this way	dev
audio_0_60391.wav	ok, so because p a is higher, the output of this inverter [vocalized noise] will also have a higher value of p, because for every transition in the input there will be a transition in the output, right	dev
audio_0_159904.wav	This can be then joined, the natural join of branch and account can be taken and that can then be taken the natural joint with depositor	dev
audio_0_213608.wav	you are expected to ensure that all tags are read and within the given time frame that is given to you	dev
audio_0_24258.wav	So in terms of process or in terms of some kinds of systematic way, have you guys attempted something in the past	dev
audio_0_79569.wav	So, if you are doing this repeatedly you have to exert a small force because if you do not exert little force then, what happens is just due to surface heterogeneity you might have be dislodged from the sample	dev
audio_0_120424.wav	And if you, and if you notice the story closely, you will see there is a big extended description about a wedding feast that happened ages ago, you know, in the context of a landlord's daughter's wedding	dev
audio_0_8611.wav	48	dev
audio_0_206503.wav	Let us draw this XY line	dev
audio_0_200533.wav	So, we have a number of approximations to this which I am going to discuss now	dev
audio_0_209299.wav	These kind of things can be possible only through computers	dev
audio_0_205244.wav	And, second thing edges are always be visible	dev
audio_0_152940.wav	Crossed fingers indicate hope, because somehow they form a rough image of the crucifix	dev
audio_0_175321.wav	For example there are 3 COs that address let us say PO3	dev
audio_0_156579.wav	Now please note the notation here	dev
audio_0_223516.wav	Or, the first letter does not match in which case is generate two subproblems, one by propping each of the letters in term and I take the maximum of the true	dev
audio_0_75332.wav	One is the positive photoresist and other is the negative photoresist	dev
audio_0_96383.wav	we also emphasized on the various patterns that can be followed when we start writing	dev
audio_0_97606.wav	So, this is become protected member and the protected member is not visible outside the class, since F is a global function here it is not visible to F	dev
audio_0_57670.wav	you have this two techniques: one by using repeaters, other by using cascaded buffers	dev
audio_0_230010.wav	Next is optical square	dev
audio_0_83191.wav	It is associated with the DC current in electronic devices; it has same power content in an octave or in each octave or decade right	dev
audio_0_103707.wav	Here we are trying to define a rectangle and this is a special kind of rectangle which will says is isocratic rectangle in the sense that this rectangle is has its size parallel to the axis x and y axis	dev
audio_0_153347.wav	As the nature and demands of different professions is growing, we find that our understanding of body language would help us in understanding the intentions and attitudes of the people and at the same time it would provide us a better orientation	dev
audio_0_1644.wav	So, it will be simply like this I your i 3 R 3 plus v 2 plus your R 2 into i 2 minus i 1, right	dev
audio_0_166038.wav	So here, this is a loop and this is also a loop because it is not tracing 1 node 1 node 2 times	dev
audio_0_72373.wav	Then infrastructure programs	dev
audio_0_132673.wav	generally one can use utilities for this purpose	dev
audio_0_52744.wav	this should have been v two	dev
audio_0_89320.wav	However, as we seen in the previous lecture the major limitation of the return to libc attack is the fact that the attacker is constrained with what the libc offers	dev
audio_0_75472.wav	So, in other words and nucleus cannot be deformed to below 10 percent of its original undeformed cross sectional area	dev
audio_0_29507.wav	And so, the law took its own course luckily law took its own course and punishment and all, because sometimes this plea of mental illness is a severe encore	dev
audio_0_66432.wav	So, let me just put that down like today we are into week 2, lecture 3, W 2, L 3 precautions to be considered before designing the layout	dev
audio_0_179550.wav	If x is the positive quantity you take it is value if it becomes negative basically it is it is it is bounded by 0 on the lower limit ok	dev
audio_0_28627.wav	The function str normally converts an object to a string, but how do we describe how str should behave for an object, well there is special function that we can write called underscore underscore str	dev
audio_0_121292.wav	He says this is the worst form of covetous anywhere in the world and this peaceful sleep is criticized by the narrator as well, the third person narrator as well who takes the moral high ground in this particular story	dev
audio_0_38362.wav	Obviously, no; but numerically dispersion may happen depending on how I have implemented FDTD so, would it be a good thing or a bad thing; obviously, a bad thing right	dev
audio_0_186838.wav	So, when I look at this objective function, let us say I again draw this and then let us say I have these points on one side and the other points on the other side	dev
audio_0_49009.wav	if i take a ring out here of charge at an angle theta, then i know this ring gives me a potential d, v which is equal to charge on this ring	dev
audio_0_119200.wav	security becomes a another important aspect of soap, a aspect of web services	dev
audio_0_46737.wav	So in the case of PI controller, the PI controller has a gain k which is infinite as the system tends towards a DC situation or a stabilized situation so let me take for example a fresh page	dev
audio_0_103431.wav	So, in C89 the literals are basically fixed values, but in C99, they are considered to be constant type data	dev
audio_0_205778.wav	In the last two classes, we have covered introduction, geometric constructions and conic sections	dev
audio_0_145570.wav	So, the utilization due to the first task is 0	dev
audio_0_116064.wav	any syllable i can have as a storage level of the if there is storage downtime or access ability problem, so on and so forth	dev
audio_0_73293.wav	So we have seen three steps of CV analysis	dev
audio_0_82457.wav	Let’s say this equation number 2	dev
audio_0_64411.wav	switch level means transitor level and geometric level means at the level of the layouts	dev
audio_0_161381.wav	So, now how to calculate the order	dev
audio_0_213494.wav	it says: calibrating a single phase energy meter based on a, d, e seven nine five three	dev
audio_0_83551.wav	, bBecause we are not applying any voltage,	dev
audio_0_220041.wav	Well, this will say that for each of the vertices or nodes 1 to n which component it belongs to, right	dev
audio_0_120127.wav	So, there seems to be a mirror image here playing out in this particular narrative	dev
audio_0_8172.wav	So, as switch was closed for a long time that means, to this and this 100 volt DC source is there, this is close; that means, this capacitor will act as an open circuit right	dev
audio_0_231231.wav	So, what is soft for me is not soft for my wife or it is not soft for my son and when you see all these diaper advertisements which is coming TV, they say it is very soft	dev
audio_0_50577.wav	this is due to a spherical charge right on the surface	dev
audio_0_225882.wav	Now, this is the rather amazing theorem, because this is that take everything an NP, anything there I can reduce the SAT	dev
audio_0_9427.wav	So, equation 10 and 11 give the energy stored in the electric field that exists between the plates of the capacitor	dev
audio_0_118373.wav	we have looked into docker technologies, so how these technologies and cloud computing can go hand in hand to provide better services	dev
audio_0_228474.wav	This is not there these are actuate not précised, ok	dev
audio_0_187874.wav	So, there is some association, but perhaps the association you cannot definitely conclude it is linear it may be non linear	dev
audio_0_82035.wav	So, he is placing this in NPN to start with, and he can see some value which is around 145, 131, 0, 7 keeps on fluctuating	dev
audio_0_83758.wav	We will see that when we use CMRR equal to 100; the output voltage that we got was 313	dev
audio_0_173411.wav	Now as we are talking about outcome based education without talking about the kind of statements that one should write as course outcomes, we will mention what the outcomes we are trying to attain	dev
audio_0_79308.wav	And you can see So, for example, compared to integrin one would expect if you are staining with, let us say paxillin or Zixin or FAK you have some signaling	dev
audio_0_231994.wav	So, one after other, but usually it’s occurring by turns	dev
audio_0_118325.wav	so some of the things, what we have tried and a what we have discussed may be ah discussed, which which may ah help you in finding your ah future research directions	dev
audio_0_59060.wav	so there is another process, is called fault simulation, which is used there	dev
audio_0_104093.wav	When you redefine a function with the different signature it is called overloading	dev
audio_0_60896.wav	lets take a very specific example with polysilicon and diffusion	dev
audio_0_165562.wav	So, with this we can close our today’s discussion in which we discuss about the controllability and observability aspect of the State variable system	dev
audio_0_34700.wav	So, we would like to convert it into single derivatives right	dev
audio_0_152811.wav	Steepling can be raised or lowered as we can see in this diagram	dev
audio_0_221626.wav	So, 5 is reachable, but 4 itself now because the value of 3 got updated	dev
audio_0_56949.wav	so lets lets explain this again with a proper diagram	dev
audio_0_192359.wav	So, let us say this is next is 3	dev
audio_0_77062.wav	In that case you will again see the same thing you would not even notice	dev
audio_0_13828.wav	714 Ohm right	dev
audio_0_130808.wav	so far we have seen water to be the working fluid of rankine cycle	dev
audio_0_55464.wav	ah, in the earlier lectures we talked about various timing issues where you do static analysis of a circuit to identify false paths and so on, so that some timing related constraints can be satisfied and if there are violations, some measures can be taken	dev
audio_0_135796.wav	If you remember, we had noted in those lectures, that most of the figures who lead the charge against the British belonged to a particular social class	dev
audio_0_154716.wav	Let us look at these cultural variations	dev
audio_0_204300.wav	So, now, it enters the bolt and we can see this see the threads uncovering one by one as the nut revolves into the bolt	dev
audio_0_32447.wav	I did not choose a testing function right	dev
audio_0_103435.wav	There are unary operations like negation	dev
audio_0_10625.wav	Now, total your, what you call, annual your residential energy it is consume 800 kilowatt hour	dev
audio_0_161333.wav	So there are this K such record pointer and key pointer	dev
audio_0_170090.wav	The model representing a linear spring element is basically shown in the figure above	dev
audio_0_224535.wav	Symmetrically, if the pivot is the largest value in your array, then you will have everything in the lower element set	dev
audio_0_131771.wav	we have thermal energy due to some source which otherwise would have been wasted, and we want to extract whatever is possible, or whatever is possible from that source of thermal energy and utilize its somewhere else where it can be put to benefit ah, to be to benefit to our benefit, and so heat pipe will enable us to do that very effectively	dev
audio_0_110839.wav	So, that is why, we have written L 2 1 is 0	dev
audio_0_98268.wav	But since these are all different types, I need to have different names given to this function and I will need to remember not only later on when I am using, I not only need to re understand what different parameters I am passing, but corresponding to that RV is a row vector M2 is a matrix	dev
audio_0_131261.wav	so then from point three we can move to point four, where it is saturated liquid and we can calculate the enthalpy at the saturated liquid condition	dev
audio_0_158266.wav	Number two, if there is a data item X and the final rights, the written values that X is written to by transaction 1 and the final right by transaction 2, the final rights are also the same	dev
audio_0_219653.wav	Each time we explore a new vertex, we immediately explore its neighbors	dev
audio_0_140992.wav	Joy, trust, fear, surprised, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation these are the eight basic emotion that Plutchik has talked about, now that Plutchik proposed eight basic emotions he said that these emotions are	dev
audio_0_52508.wav	this is going to the area in the direction phi	dev
audio_0_8488.wav	So, v C is equal to 1 into i L right and i L is equal to 2 ampere therefore, v C is equal to basically 2 volt right	dev
audio_0_61307.wav	so the data value that to be stored here, that will take meaningful interpretation only after two clock pulses	dev
audio_0_180275.wav	So, basically there is coherent techniques, there is the differential techniques and each of them have a benefit for us in terms of our usage in a fading channel whether	dev
audio_0_84375.wav	Suppose I want to understand the math function, which is see MM, is the math function right	dev
audio_0_192491.wav	So, recall for problem 3, the assumption was R any ring; R any ring I J two ideals such that; such that, s	dev
audio_0_154271.wav	Our neck tilt also shows how most people understand things on an intuitive level and in a business negotiations with men, if a head tilt is shown very often, it is often considered to be an act of submission or an indication that things would be sooner or later accepted by you and therefore, women are often advised to particularly keep their head up and straight in all times during any negotiations	dev
audio_0_132623.wav	inlet temperature of the hot fluid, inlet temperature of the cold fluid	dev
audio_0_10452.wav	And then 2 tau 3 tau up to 5 tau it is shown right	dev
audio_0_132873.wav	when we studied mechanical engineering, we came to know that the ic engine ah that the cycle consists of four segments, four strokes, ok, the suction car stroke, the compression stroke, the expansion stroke, which we also call the power stroke, and then the exhaust stroke four strokes	dev
audio_0_164397.wav	Now if you give this node as a this node as b this node as c and this is o that is the ground or may be origin you can say	dev
audio_0_198780.wav	This RG, it plays a somewhat similar role as before	dev
audio_0_101506.wav	Whereas, earlier in the example, we showed that the static data members are public which has encapsulation issues	dev
audio_0_237773.wav	Community oriented cultures, tend to look at, how things are done	dev
audio_0_49606.wav	what does this energy do	dev
audio_0_207810.wav	If we are looking from top view it looks like a smaller kind of rectangle	dev
audio_0_136327.wav	Or, you could see the middle class engaged in professions like law, education, journalism, medicine, etcetera	dev
audio_0_179442.wav	So, to summarize outage will be if the SNR is below the threshold that we have set	dev
audio_0_138803.wav	They are as I have mentioned that they may be online but they are non real time, some of them may be online	dev
audio_0_175396.wav	06	dev
audio_0_170233.wav	So, in this you get input from 1 by L as a gain from ec, so ecs will be now connected to this block with 1 by L as a gain and here you get negative as a part of summation, so instead of sum it will be subtracted from the total value	dev
audio_0_176575.wav	It is a very simple definition	dev
audio_0_176431.wav	So put in simple words, evaluate is concerned with selecting certain criteria and applying these criteria to the solutions and coming to or judging or making a decision with regard to the preference of a particular solution	dev
audio_0_150464.wav	So, this is B, which is the follower of A and A is the following of B, I think we talked about what Twitter is, basic terminologies, very early in the course	dev
audio_0_135336.wav	This basically gives us a feel that actually what happens in the case of human being is that in the initial phase we have a drastic loss of information and this loss gradually starts getting stabilized	dev
audio_0_115287.wav	so it allocation, again based on different metrics or measurement parameters	dev
audio_0_219870.wav	Similarly, with two sub sequences the actual letters in the sequence determine what is common between them	dev
audio_0_70004.wav	So, again as of now we have not talked about medium just assume that we you have a particular composition of medium where these cells will grow or a buffered solution supplemented by different growth factors	dev
audio_0_41938.wav	So, now, this operator is in need of some function to act on always	dev
audio_0_62351.wav	zero in or so means if any one of the changes, output will change, so it will be l h, union, l, e, union, z, stuck at zero	dev
audio_0_57876.wav	ok, so here	dev
audio_0_160720.wav	So what is the only candidate key	dev
audio_0_58124.wav	ok, ok, so there are a few interesting points here	dev
audio_0_83635.wav	This is obvious because even if the input voltage is of few volts; due to large open loop gain the difference of voltage Vd at the input terminals is almost 0	dev
audio_0_201619.wav	Here another example we have again radius R19	dev
audio_0_230589.wav	There are number of possible errors which can happen in this, but still people do it for a ballpark figure	dev
audio_0_175130.wav	Somebody shows how to hit a ball	dev
audio_0_122906.wav	And he also wants everything to be ticotty boo, everything to be in good order	dev
audio_0_4655.wav	So, that is actually is equal to it is 12 by 8 so that is 3 by 2	dev
audio_0_81719.wav	Because infinite gain, but what we saw, right in experiment is that, even there is infinite gain, right	dev
audio_0_53260.wav	again, i want to remind you this minus sign, the curl of b equation, whether they are changing with the time, not changing with time, electrostatic, magnetostatic, everything is described by these four equations	dev
audio_0_38596.wav	So, both currents are z directed and radius is much smaller than wavelength ok	dev
audio_0_213329.wav	ok, so this transformer that you see here has two ah tappings	dev
audio_0_180246.wav	So, you would use the decisions that you have already made and do the channel tracking	dev
audio_0_119818.wav	so this can be one ah one way of ah looking at that a a application which has a direct implication of our day to day life	dev
audio_0_40629.wav	So, slight confusion over here, this incident field do not think of it as the field that is coming out of an antenna or something, I mean it is not it is the field that is being incident on the boundary, which I should observe	dev
audio_0_36107.wav	So, we will come to that in subsequent	dev
audio_0_121502.wav	She easily forgot her old friend and found a new one in Nubby, the size	dev
audio_0_157385.wav	And then the third one is called a double hashing, where instead of using the iath attempt, a completely new function is evaluated	dev
audio_0_141551.wav	That is why nearly 50% fall of profit because their other expenses came down by 240, at least they were saved	dev
audio_0_52120.wav	So, by making these pictures, what I am making you feel is that, something exists around a given charge and that is what I am going to call electric field	dev
audio_0_74811.wav	So, they then experiment with lamin A/C knock down cells also found that with this on the circular patterns the extent of area fluctuation increased, increased then did experiments by perturbing Nesprin and still they observed area fluctuations	dev
audio_0_47107.wav	So it will look in there and automatically put in the proper background color	dev
audio_0_198351.wav	So, the solution to this can be obtained as a superposition of this where we have only VI applied to the network and this where we have only V10 applied to the network	dev
audio_0_116266.wav	these are ah, not any straight forward things	dev
audio_0_37033.wav	I will show you what will do with TM polarization	dev
audio_0_83760.wav	0135, which is close to 300 millivolts	dev
audio_0_96344.wav	that is why, when you are going to a write a circular, you are to think whether a circular is needed or a memo is needed	dev
audio_0_235431.wav	Or, is it moving from, or is it adding, on to their skills, growth and development of skills	dev
audio_0_131494.wav	but we know that gamma for air will come to the point one, point four	dev
audio_0_38336.wav	Here curl of which quantity	dev
audio_0_211486.wav	so this is the l t e spice, l t e three, one zero nine	dev
audio_0_228700.wav	What is the static correction that we should adds to the instrument that should be inculcated every time we use this instrument	dev
audio_0_11740.wav	Therefore, volt ampere is equal to VI volt is equal to real power square plus reactive power square right	dev
audio_0_198781.wav	Essentially this RG putting it here, make sure that the DC voltage here and there are the same	dev
audio_0_134397.wav	Cannon Bard Theory came in 1915, and this was further revision of James Lange view point	dev
audio_0_10329.wav	Now, assuming delta is very small equal to 0	dev
audio_0_28027.wav	So in C if you need dynamic memory, so remember that all the things that you declare in advance are allocated statically, you cannot undo them, you cannot say hence forth I do not need them	dev
audio_0_176124.wav	So that is what the definition is	dev
audio_0_153965.wav	When we meet a person for the first time then we quickly glance at a person and on the basis of what we see, we make an immediate judgment on the basis of these cues	dev
audio_0_66872.wav	Now, when you talk about the peripheral neurons, this is a neuron the way the myelination happens when these neurons are formed in the body is there are these Schwann cells and this is all about pianos these Schwann cells arrive at the axon and as well as the dendrite because this myelination you will see here to right	dev
audio_0_223998.wav	Now, from 8 we cannot do anything, so we return from 8 back to 5, now 5 has nothing left to explore	dev
audio_0_229669.wav	So, please understand this is for mass production	dev
audio_0_148267.wav	I am also a part of Research Group called Precog, which primarily works on privacy and security in online social media, computational social science, data science, social computing and usable technologies which are around these topics	dev
audio_0_100379.wav	So, it is just that such copy assignment operators are possible, but you will primarily use this and in some cases you will use this	dev
audio_0_19284.wav	But if actual loss exceeds that, then the person will be questioned whether there was any unbuilt sale or something like that	dev
audio_0_42107.wav	But it gave it to you in analytical form or numerical form	dev
audio_0_178913.wav	Now, slowly fading channels with a specific characteristic; the characteristic is that the gamma of n, that is the instantaneous SNR is not changing symbol to symbol, it is constant for a block of symbols, is constant for a block of symbols, block of symbols and then gamma changes it is constant for a block and then after that it changes, after that gamma n changes to a new value, independent value	dev
audio_0_13322.wav	We are only interested in impulse function, unit step function and the ramp right	dev
audio_0_153839.wav	Another aspect, which has been termed as the textual paralanguage is the use of emoticons	dev
audio_0_36415.wav	My fields are already tangential because there is no z component; right, if there were a z component that would be a normal component right	dev
audio_0_93266.wav	in some we have the problem of plural	dev
audio_0_71615.wav	Just to give an analogy, you may be trying to do a mathematical theorem proving or maybe trying to solve a problem, mathematical problem	dev
audio_0_115759.wav	we will try to have a quick look ah on this aspect so that we can have ah, we can have a feel of it, right	dev
audio_0_16587.wav	Therefore rotor copper loss will be S upon minus S into mechanical output	dev
audio_0_186965.wav	We can show again through based on the assumptions we have made that the variance of beta 1 hat will be equal to sigma squared by S xx	dev
audio_0_152138.wav	In earlier the accuracy which lower now the techniques, technologies that are actually improved	dev
audio_0_161860.wav	This is sometimes also known as an optimistic concurrency control protocol	dev
audio_0_176032.wav	It should be remembered that PEOs and PSOs are to be written by the specially designated committees as indicated following a well documented process	dev
audio_0_41134.wav	So, if I take the z component of this entire x equation that is what I will get over here	dev
audio_0_197775.wav	Now, first of all, we can write down the nonlinear equation which is to equate the current in the resistor, vS minus VD by R, to be equal to the current in the diode in terms of its voltage which is i	dev
audio_0_157834.wav	Sorting is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer science and databases are no exception	dev
audio_0_132197.wav	it is called p and the ah definition of p, expression of p has been given: heat actually transferred to the fluid which would be transferred if same cold fluid temperature was raised to the hot fluid inlet temperature	dev
audio_0_99743.wav	We are not going to get into the logic of how the sorting is done	dev
audio_0_148421.wav	This is only for you to see visually, what data is coming back; you can take the data that is coming out of Facebook, copy paste it into this JSON viewer, and you will be able to see, what the fields are	dev
audio_0_239193.wav	But, one should be able to see the effects, from beginning to end	dev
audio_0_96312.wav	actually, the recipient of your letter report would like to know that the findings which he has made do	dev
audio_0_202671.wav	So, true length we will get it by projecting it on the horizontal plane	dev
audio_0_225486.wav	So, that subsequent delete max take this one in to account	dev
audio_0_179469.wav	And then how does it have ramifications in terms of our understanding of wireless capacity as a whole ok	dev
audio_0_194684.wav	It is exactly the same thing	dev
audio_0_182824.wav	So, again we do not have to rewrite just take the equation from the previous case	dev
audio_0_153328.wav	Olfactics is based on our sense of a smell	dev
audio_0_163997.wav	Now, let us take one example so that we can clear the concept, let say we have one circuit as shown in the figure, here one inductor of 0	dev
audio_0_189637.wav	In this lecture we are going to see how to do arithmetic operations, logical operations and matrix operations in R	dev
audio_0_229072.wav	And now I will try to plot these values	dev
audio_0_80822.wav	Let us see another example design	dev
audio_0_106164.wav	Unless it is described in detail, in writing it will be very hard for a person to understand the improvement in the engine, unless he analyzes it, or he breaks it down, or a reverse engineers, it will be very hard for that person to understand where the contribution is with regard to that particular invention	dev
audio_0_23469.wav	We call it organizational neurosis thank you	dev
audio_0_100089.wav	So, certainly they are not of the same type assignment should not be possible, but implicitly it will cast the integer to the double and allow me to do this	dev
audio_0_124740.wav	So, what I am going to show is regardless of what reference you choose there is no ambiguity in the definition of power	dev
audio_0_117888.wav	these are required for different type of applications or data which are something maybe a proprietary in nature	dev
audio_0_78668.wav	So, ideally, so you ideally want the hMSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes	dev
audio_0_178678.wav	Take the moment generating function and substitute	dev
audio_0_104843.wav	But just to illustrate the point, I am showing you here through prints	dev
audio_0_237674.wav	And, it becomes, sometimes, it becomes hard for the organization, to convince its stakeholders, that these people actually need to be paid, that much salary	dev
audio_0_149309.wav	We have successfully generated an extended access token	dev
audio_0_183938.wav	So, it has a lot of information that that you need to in order to be able to connect to that	dev
audio_0_16221.wav	So, when you talking when you are considering for ith second this loop bigger one, when you considering the whole one at the time see the repetition will be there for the mutual induce mutual voltage right	dev
audio_0_207188.wav	Now, can we guess sectional views of this object	dev
audio_0_173210.wav	Select the most cost effective tool	dev
audio_0_124634.wav	because we dont write any equation for the reference node, you cant right any equation for the super node either	dev
audio_0_5004.wav	So, , we know Z star 8 plus j 6 will 10 angle thirty 6	dev
audio_0_196855.wav	Regardless of the parameter set you choose, it turns out these will be the constraints	dev
audio_0_97715.wav	So, if she would copy their codes, then this is what it will look like this is the same	dev
audio_0_26545.wav	It takes the right value and makes it the current value the left value right dot left and makes with the left	dev
audio_0_143283.wav	So, we need a mercantile system where all rentries are made irrespective of cash received or not	dev
audio_0_45151.wav	Now if you see only during this portion we see conduction in the diode	dev
audio_0_131466.wav	we will continue with our course on energy conservation and waste heat recovery	dev
audio_0_187706.wav	And you have lots of records for normal use of credit card and some records for fraudulent use of credit card	dev
audio_0_152431.wav	Alan Westin has actually looked at this ways of what privacy means	dev
audio_0_44629.wav	So based on this, you know this, you know this by design, this by design, this by design, this can be the value, data sheet value chosen from the other chosen device	dev
audio_0_189778.wav	In this video we have seen how to do arithmetic logical and matrix operations in R	dev
audio_0_211887.wav	please, five minutes and do it at low resolution	dev
audio_0_52649.wav	let me again write the same lines that i made for charge and it at rest	dev
audio_0_225451.wav	And it is very often very difficult to estimate the probabilities of different types of inputs	dev
audio_0_131881.wav	so we can understand from this example that how thermodynamic principles can be utilized for analyzing the waste heat recovery system	dev
audio_0_47209.wav	So let us say at the time of start up the cold value of the thermal thermoster resistance is 10 oms	dev
audio_0_207575.wav	So, this was coincidental mate	dev
audio_0_80556.wav	there is a small dot there is a small dot you see	dev
audio_0_81411.wav	Because we are using R we are using C and we are using operational amplifier	dev
audio_0_73474.wav	If sales do not increase then benefits will be severely reduced and project may have to suffer with an NPV of again dollar what some five bucks or so so company estimates the likelihood of the market increasing the significantly or 20 percent so it is estimated that that the likelihood of the market increasing market expands it is 20 percent, the probability is 20 percent and hence the probability that the market will not increase, market will not expand is 80 percent	dev
audio_0_207527.wav	In solidworks the first part we can see	dev
audio_0_145632.wav	In the last lecture we had discussed an important category of real time task scheduler	dev
audio_0_196097.wav	Now this is perfectly all right as far as V0 is concerned but there could be a slight problem with this particular choice of C2 that I will show	dev
audio_0_207107.wav	So, when we are removing that part, the thin elements we never show it by hatched lines; compared to the object size, any thin supports like plates, flanges and so on things, we do not show it by any hatched lines, this is a first convention Only thick elements we represent it by this hatch thing	dev
audio_0_188665.wav	So, the di erence between the equality constraint and the inequality con straint is the following, in the equality constraint we had every point on this line being a feasible solution when you make this as a inequality constraint	dev
audio_0_225300.wav	But, these names are no longer in use, because these components have a got merged directly or indirectly with j	dev
audio_0_159548.wav	On the other hand, if R intersection S is a foreign key in S that references R, then what happens is that this is exactly equal to be ns because this is a foreign key in S	dev
audio_0_195701.wav	You can think of this in many different ways	dev
audio_0_216386.wav	u s also that you get integrated into very high end phones	dev
audio_0_48755.wav	so the two equations that i have are this string from the left hand side, the string on the right hand side	dev
audio_0_60808.wav	so maybe in the next step i shall be placing b	dev
audio_0_187387.wav	So, this is a mistake of the classifier and this is a success of the classifier	dev
audio_0_223539.wav	So, we get it 2	dev
audio_0_174583.wav	So broadly it belongs to the Apply cognitive level and you have Conceptual and Procedural part is anyway implied directly	dev
audio_0_144473.wav	So, for patents it is 2 to 12 years, for computer software it is 1 to 8 years, then for dealer network it is 20 years and for intellectual property rights it is 3 to 10 years	dev
audio_0_65708.wav	now, upon adding, if you see the change in the force generated by the myotube, then in a very clean system, in vitro setup, you will be able to predict how a specific drug is going to behave in a system like this	dev
audio_0_5591.wav	So, v 1 is equal to from these it is clear that I applied that KVL here only that is your 5 i 1 plus v 1 minus 30 is equal to 0 right	dev
audio_0_166890.wav	So, this will be anyway become zero	dev
audio_0_39062.wav	It will not be a summation it will be a integral right	dev
audio_0_11904.wav	This is the area of the coil right	dev
audio_0_221291.wav	So, we will again compute iteratively this quantity P k i j, it says that there is the path and this path uses only the vertices 1 to k	dev
audio_0_12833.wav	So, there will be a time, in this case what will happen, in this case what will happen, before going to this thing in this case this will remain as say v infinity plus now this one, this was your there when t is equal to 0	dev
audio_0_160216.wav	But still there is a problem with scalability when you think of very large projects	dev
audio_0_191253.wav	So, a 1 has a multiplicative inverse	dev
audio_0_99842.wav	In C++, it is again available from component algorithm and it is called binary underscore search	dev
audio_0_28561.wav	So, we have might assign this to a name like n right	dev
audio_0_200286.wav	There can't possibly be any amplification from the device	dev
audio_0_207577.wav	Suppose this particular block has its origin we can see this origin over here	dev
audio_0_117717.wav	so we will quickly look at some of these ah popular or example cloud providers, slas or what they type like, try to give the like amazon ec	dev
audio_0_47038.wav	You'll ask for the password and then execute it so in my case i have already installed all these packages it will search and look for the packages in the repository and install them so you have the g sim check the g sim docs netlist symbols utiles g shem the g shell the g shell the G Sim check, the G Sim Docs, netlist symbols, utiles G Shem, the G E D A, G Schematic	dev
audio_0_26003.wav	Supposing, we write these 3 statements	dev
audio_0_123945.wav	let me show the voltage source explicitly	dev

audio_0_126316.wav	Let us considered the same circuit again; I will illustrate with this example, but this is true of every circuit with N nodes	dev
audio_0_86477.wav	So, the demo is present in this particular directory nptel codes/ module 1 and it corresponds to this C code skip instruction	dev
audio_0_212692.wav	thats why i wrote here: d t l s is also a very important thing	dev
audio_0_61714.wav	now selection of the moves was done like this: first, timber wolf selected and moved between m one and m two	dev
audio_0_28574.wav	The connection between the two is that x is r cos theta where cos is the trigonometric cosine function; y is equal to r sin theta	dev
audio_0_191557.wav	So, it has to be x plus something, but it also has to have alpha as a root, so the coefficient must be minus alpha	dev
audio_0_183618.wav	6 milliseconds, definitely not affected by the duration of a fade because the fade would have already have gone if you are at 3 kilometers per hour very likely that you may have problems with your next time slot also	dev
audio_0_144614.wav	For example, if there is a share swap	dev
audio_0_146333.wav	So, typical schedule table would look like the different frames and the tasks that are to be executed	dev

audio_0_233684.wav	The objectives of these training methods are, first is promoting, self insight and environmental awareness	dev
audio_0_71302.wav	are the result of having the requirements worked out at the beginning of the development and then all the development proceeds based on the documented requirements is fundamentally wrong	dev
audio_0_200520.wav	The source voltage will remain fixed	dev
audio_0_216020.wav	you could have an a e s key sitting on either side and only if the key matches, you are able to decrypt using the city as a s key, and then the pulse is actually displayed ah on the phone	dev
audio_0_181645.wav	Basically it is just to visualize what a link budget is and how it is impacts a wireless system	dev
audio_0_135976.wav	Thus, as the reader realises, the colonial subjugation of Africa as Achebe depicts it in this novel, is not the simplistic story of a strong European aggressor conquering and subjugating the weak Africans	dev
audio_0_232036.wav	Okay, let’s start, I wish you that, you all do very well in this one	dev
audio_0_92786.wav	So, only the second term has z which will give us y and this del F3 over del x will also get this y the same because here this is just z which will become 0 because we are making this partial derivative with respect to x	dev
audio_0_40040.wav	This H over here which has the unknown term I will move it back to when I get Ax is equal to b	dev
audio_0_212093.wav	alright, so all the configurations can be now shown on the subscriber	dev
audio_0_90174.wav	So you could also search and we will also try to share a document which comprises of all the various commands the gdb has and you can actually try various things with gdb and also try to do such debugging with various other programs using gdb, look at the various registers and see how the stack and other local variables are maintained, thank you	dev
audio_0_118332.wav	these part a important role and it is it is ah sort of a ah with, with the ah hardware and other related technologies, upcoming technologies coming in to play	dev
audio_0_11665.wav	So, 56 by 8 by root 2 that will become your 40 volt that is why this is 40 volt this is rms value	dev
audio_0_84197.wav	Now, what you see on the screen	dev
audio_0_219887.wav	So, we’re talking about the daily production of these sweets, so we will use two variables b and h to denote the number of boxes of barfis and halwa that we produce in a day	dev
audio_0_46086.wav	So we have the labels, we have the ground, we have the components in place, we have wired it, we have to give the component names	dev
audio_0_227502.wav	The only difference in the vertical scale was at that the first division was not coinciding	dev
audio_0_131696.wav	fine, therefore, this is the evaporator section	dev
audio_0_107891.wav	Velcro again a trade name and we understand the product by the trade name itself	dev
audio_0_218181.wav	its switching at a quite a high ah and ah, its response time, indeed, is a has high, it can be as high as four megahertz, whereas ah, the switching regulator in the switching regulator, switching regulator, what about it	dev
audio_0_202709.wav	Once we are done these point we call a	dev
audio_0_20315.wav	In case in future, the product demand has not increased or whether it has increased, either way the cost of advertising once incurred becomes sunk	dev
audio_0_196318.wav	So we will replace C2 also with a short circuit while carrying out calculations for C1	dev
audio_0_178803.wav	So, let us not call it optimum anymore what did we do we all the G ks where some constant times Z k star divided by mod Z k	dev
audio_0_35417.wav	So, let us say this is volume 1 and volume 2 sorry inside let us call it volume 2 and inside, I mean outside its volume 1, inside its volume 2	dev
audio_0_35242.wav	So, but this keeping it general has given us a strategy that we can use to formulate I mean to get the solution to this	dev
audio_0_35029.wav	If I impose this condition and there is actually only vacuum over there, then right traveling wave will it see any numerical reflection	dev
audio_0_238956.wav	But, business partner model of HRM, sees this department as, not really as an assistive department or activity	dev
audio_0_67210.wav	So, for you this place is reserved	dev
audio_0_176079.wav	But right now, we will look at the four general categories	dev
audio_0_144290.wav	Possible, I am saying, not certain	dev

audio_0_25233.wav	He is not satisfied with the amount of understanding	dev
audio_0_74488.wav	So, actin is only one of the cytoskeletal proteins you also have microtubules, one of the most important things which	dev
audio_0_135475.wav	But what is more important to note here is and this is very ironic that in this conference, which decided the fate of the African continent for decades to come, not a single African representative was present	dev
audio_0_87921.wav	So if you go back and look at this particular slide what we see is that when i has a value of 84 it shows a execution time which is considerably lower compared to all other memory accesses to that array	dev
audio_0_130426.wav	after that there is a constant process, a constant pressure process	dev
audio_0_53563.wav	so what it means is, if i take a small volume here in this region where the e and b field is exist, the momentum contained with this volume is going to be, per unit volume, epsilon naught, e cross b	dev
audio_0_141254.wav	So, financial statements give vast amount of data	dev
audio_0_8757.wav	So, stator windings are here	dev
audio_0_25715.wav	Now let us come to the stereo electronic requirement for E2 elimination, okay	dev
audio_0_119536.wav	dimension values, in case of a column oriented, require multiple indexes if different projection are to be indexed in a sorted order	dev
audio_0_80562.wav	So, he has connected now let us focus on the breadboard, he has connected the integrated circuit which is 741, right	dev
audio_0_216916.wav	why do you want to do this	dev
audio_0_189658.wav	So, this is the summary of logical operations that can be performed in R	dev
audio_0_166306.wav	So, what is the value of delta	dev
audio_0_64597.wav	now, if any one of the input is having stuck at one fault, so number of one will change from even to odd	dev
audio_0_188396.wav	One is what we call as a consistent scenario, where we could have in nite solutions, and the other one is what is called the inconsistent scenario where we might have no solution	dev
audio_0_13301.wav	For the advanced unit ramp function right, this is for advanced r t plus t 0	dev

audio_0_59729.wav	so i have to make some adjustments in my circuit so that these negative slacks become, ah, positive again	dev
audio_0_122945.wav	And again, those five years that Sir Monal has been in England is a kind of a happy place in his mind, one that he keeps revisiting through all these various objects and references to England	dev
audio_0_235764.wav	Where you would like to be, at the peak of your career, preferably in not more than 20 words	dev
audio_0_207236.wav	If, we are looking from this view this makes like horizontal plane there, vertical plane there, if we are looking from this direction it looks like a line top one is horizontal plane, bottom one is vertical plane	dev
audio_0_104137.wav	Second from a function; this is a very simple case we are showing here, from a function there could be multiple places from where I actually return, if I am returning from multiple places I do not know before and which particular return statement will be taken by the control flow	dev
audio_0_96489.wav	let me give you another example where you will also feel that why this sentence has become so long where it could have been short	dev
audio_0_71274.wav	And then we'll discuss about other models which overcome specific shortcomings of the waterfall model	dev
audio_0_14998.wav	So, with this ah this is this is a typical ah your example for your for circuit just looking at the circuit nothing to be hold it	dev
audio_0_52104.wav	And due to this entire charge distribution, I just integrated all, this becomes the electric field by principle of super position	dev
audio_0_146944.wav	Now let's do a few practice questions before we complete the course	dev
audio_0_145122.wav	We will continue in the next session but we have just started so that you can take the sheet and continue it and then compare with the answer which we will discuss in the next session	dev
audio_0_104488.wav	If it points to a b object it has the virtual function table pointer it goes to this virtual function table of b this is what it has got, it picks of function 0 the 0th function and calls that, so it is calling b colon colon g	dev
audio_0_86085.wav	So, the random value which is going to be present in the canary is obtained from this particular location GS colon 20 that is in the segment pointed to by the GS and at an offset 20 the random data which is present over here which is essentially that segment has is a random store	dev
audio_0_8921.wav	Similarly, i 4 is equal to your v 2 by 10 v 2 by 10, right; that is you i 4	dev
audio_0_39247.wav	So, it is not this is not the only root possible I could for example, have gone like this or any complicated root let I could have gone like this, does not matter it is not specified over here	dev
audio_0_169457.wav	Now, this is any way expected because in case of ideal transformer, you will take transformer as a lossless equipment	dev
audio_0_217606.wav	now this is gone up, which means there is going to be more power dissipation, more power dissipation	dev
audio_0_11111.wav	And this is another simple problem right you have to find out that that you have to just answer is given right, that stove element this much, when connected to a this long how long does it take to consume 30000 joules	dev
audio_0_109873.wav	So, roughly if you stay within that theta zone then your transformer is within the acceptable zone	dev
audio_0_217775.wav	this must be point six, right, this is one fifty millivolt	dev
audio_0_18616.wav	This is pi and this is your 3 pi by 2 and this is your 2 pi right	dev

audio_0_180487.wav	So, basically this is what helps us generate this waveforms on a computer, ok	dev
audio_0_206799.wav	What we have drawn is; this portion we have drawn, this one also we have drawn and this portion we have drawn, but this line supposed to match this line	dev
audio_0_122705.wav	So the idea of being trapped is also there	dev
audio_0_147688.wav	Now to make the graph more visible, let us try changing the color of the nodes	dev
audio_0_60159.wav	some of them will be hitting the obstacles, some of them will be crossing like this, will go similarly in the, in this direction	dev
audio_0_96897.wav	So, for now, just take it by heart that new is an operator, which instead of taking a value, it can actually take a types	dev
audio_0_4106.wav	So, this is closed this is closed and and this this is your node a, this v means your v infinity right the steady state value at that time this this one it is short circuited right	dev
audio_0_20694.wav	Of course subject to our assumptions that fixed costs and variable costs don't change	dev
audio_0_205495.wav	So, we are showing that one as hatched lines	dev
audio_0_21296.wav	So, overheads are charged using rate for hour	dev
audio_0_38902.wav	If I continue	dev
audio_0_8489.wav	So, let me clear it so that that is why v C is equal to 2 volt now energy here what you call energy stored in the capacitor is Wc is equal to half C v C square	dev
audio_0_70704.wav	So then we have to add all the degree of influence for all the 14 general systems	dev
audio_0_92629.wav	So, this is what we have defined this error, the difference between this f and this polynomial here with this square and then integral	dev
audio_0_223370.wav	So, having shown that it is correct, let us just quickly look at how we would implement this and estimate the upper bound of the complexity	dev
audio_0_240081.wav	It has to be enough, not very little, not too much	dev
audio_0_10.wav	So, he basically organize the thought process of how do incorporated to the design change in a particular design	dev
audio_0_18820.wav	Here, it is i 0 and this capacitor this 240 60 all are in parallel	dev
audio_0_228604.wav	These are the effects of uncontrolled variables, ok, or the variations in the procedure	dev
audio_0_205529.wav	At section A if I am picking, if I am representing that, we will be having these material portions wherever hatching is happening	dev
audio_0_230314.wav	On the other way round, you have this	dev
audio_0_187485.wav	Those are the number of times, we got this right	dev
audio_0_43000.wav	So, how do I how do I mean how would should I choose this s 2	dev
audio_0_69871.wav	So, what I wanted to highlight here	dev
audio_0_222455.wav	But, in an unweighted graph that is a graph which just has simple edges the way we have it now	dev
audio_0_29057.wav	So, I mark all these squares which are reachable from a x and a y, some of which were already marked, some of which are marked just now	dev
audio_0_187724.wav	Then whenever you get a test data, let us say 1 3, you plug this into this sigmoidal function and you get a probability	dev
audio_0_118423.wav	these are the things which are not there in that a big way in case of a traditional things, traditional security measures, and this becomes a new way of looking at the security in some cases	dev
audio_0_135869.wav	And the beauty of Achebe’s novel is how swiftly it manages to convey this worldview to the reader and lend it a sense of cultural thickness	dev
audio_0_106440.wav	So, if you have to classify the specification into two parts; you will just say the specification comprises of two parts; the descriptive part and the claim	dev
audio_0_142704.wav	Then in Germany, in Japan, South Africa, in several countries, similar laws have been introduced	dev

audio_0_47404.wav	In such a case the pole whether it is connected to one throw or the other will have a defined potential and therefore the output V0	dev
audio_0_195098.wav	What is understood is that if this is the incremental picture, you have to replace the MOS transistor with its incremental equivalent circuit which is the GM and GDS and so on whatever is in the most transistor okay for convenience many times you don't show the two port picture but you simply show a MOSFET but if it's the incremental picture it should be the incremental equivalent of the MOSFET	dev
audio_0_187166.wav	Now, clearly the interval confidence interval for beta naught includes zero and therefore, we should not reject the null hypothesis beta naught equal to 0	dev
audio_0_11497.wav	Now, now this one your if for three phase system, we assumed also same thing that your three phase systems, so resistance is R dash, R dash, R dash; three lines is there phase a, b, c; this side is three phase balanced source right, and this is three phase balanced load	dev
audio_0_178505.wav	So, what did we achieve or what is the outcome of our observation	dev
audio_0_145640.wav	T1 arrives only after 20 and T2 arrives at 0	dev
audio_0_30209.wav	A surgeon then of course, you realize that you know you have to confront	dev
audio_0_221241.wav	So, I need to do these update exactly n times, so that after n times I capture the shortest way paths which include any arbitrary combination of vertices on the path	dev
audio_0_35155.wav	So, if these conditions are not satisfied then we cannot make any statement about the uniqueness of the theorem of the fields that is all there is ok	dev
audio_0_4743.wav	So, it will be 2 into i then this is plus	dev
audio_0_126935.wav	So, both of these are linear elements, we will see later, see linearity of whole circuits, and how super position applies to them, and it is not just a property; it is something which can simplify the solutions of circuits	dev
audio_0_69810.wav	So, if you remember in the week 5 the last lecture this is where we stopped and I told you do not lose sight of it because we will be coming back soon after a bit of a digression of understanding the myelination	dev
audio_0_155471.wav	As it is an exaggerated emotion, we find that there are many ways in which it is expressed in an exaggerated manner by our facial features	dev

audio_0_144366.wav	For example, firstly we will we know that the total depreciation, total number of working hours are 40,000	dev
audio_0_40914.wav	How do you find Za is the question	dev
audio_0_230681.wav	Tie rods are basically there is a rod in between and the extreme ends you have two nuts or two spaces or two stoppers	dev
audio_0_216575.wav	so it now turns out that v l d o is the one that will give you resupply	dev
audio_0_145424.wav	Also, if the real time operating system is to be used for embedded systems, then the size of the operating system, sometimes called as the footprint of the operating system, needs to be very small	dev
audio_0_24973.wav	Lots of companies bought this idea and actually brought Prof Arnold to their company and said, “hey can you do this for us as, well for our employees as well,	dev
audio_0_57344.wav	ah, this is an interesting structure like here	dev
audio_0_131942.wav	so pressure and temperature should be known to calculate the enthalpy	dev
audio_0_53261.wav	so entire electrodynamics, classical electrodynamics, is based on these four equations	dev
audio_0_81236.wav	So, when you talk about the integrator, it performs the function of integration that is why in the starting of the op amp lectures, I told you the operational amplifier can be used to solve the mathematical functions	dev
audio_0_136280.wav	And he, as a centre of that community, fails, falters, and ultimately sort of, commits suicide	dev
audio_0_181332.wav	So, that would mean your operator and your information about where you are normally which is your home location, national destination code	dev
audio_0_222753.wav	So, now we scan the remaining elements and we identify that 32 is the smallest element	dev
audio_0_226448.wav	Another example could be the number of defectives produced in a day by a machine, ok	dev

audio_0_167077.wav	The multiplication of a single variable by a constant is represented by the gain block	dev
audio_0_225584.wav	So, here this smallest edge weights, so remember that we have sorted it in edges	dev
audio_0_95610.wav	now, having understood your readers or your audience, now is the time, because you know initially we had said that you need to identify the problem, you need to identify the scope how much it will ah effect, and then you also need to understand the background of your reader	dev
audio_0_187847.wav	Typically in order to get a good estimate of the correlation coefficient between y and x you need at least 20 30 points	dev
audio_0_57751.wav	so fanin restructuring is this: whenever there are number of lines coming of the input of the gates that, using simply boolean rules	dev
audio_0_235099.wav	And, you need to take legal precautions, for laying people off	dev
audio_0_220189.wav	This is the same as saying that send point was being different components	dev
audio_0_126511.wav	now some other terms could be scaled: vp, we could get something else here and that will appear in this position	dev
audio_0_131541.wav	so thats going to be the meter cube per hour	dev
audio_0_173789.wav	AI3 is here	dev
audio_0_28228.wav	So, we have in other words we have 15 slots, where we can make moves and then we just say first we make an up move, then we make a right move then we make an up move then make another up move and so on	dev
audio_0_56831.wav	not only that i have to represent one unique bit combination which will denote the empty cells, and another bit combination that will denote the obstacles, so a total of l plus two	dev
audio_0_188163.wav	When you say structure of data what do we mean by that is in the data set you have what are the variables that are there, and what are their data types	dev
audio_0_64216.wav	for a gate array, they are the transistors or the gates which are fixed	dev
audio_0_151770.wav	We take a look at video now and then I will describe some details which is from the video and other features of whisper	dev
audio_0_28233.wav	then n choose k is n factorial by k factorial into n minus k factorial	dev
audio_0_35495.wav	Break into triangles so right	dev
audio_0_97683.wav	If I want to do this and also want to keep referring to the library function, I can still define my abs function, but I will just put it in a new namespace	dev
audio_0_167327.wav	So, we have to keep in mind that not all circuits can be converted into the equivalent Z parameters to a few of them are like we discussed with the help of ideal transformer example	dev
audio_0_137580.wav	Always you should choose the simplest controller that you need which will suffice, right	dev
audio_0_216855.wav	it uses a photodiode and ambient light sensor for pulsar detection	dev
audio_0_120214.wav	And the entire society of Lucknow is drowned in central pleasures, you know, pleasures that involve prostitutes, buffoons, music, writing poetry and the game of chess	dev
audio_0_172538.wav	That is perfect alignment	dev
audio_0_95102.wav	we have talked about the structure, the format, the style	dev
audio_0_75631.wav	So, you have Dbr and Dwall	dev
audio_0_166657.wav	For the sake of simplicity let us assume that the second inductor carries no current	dev
audio_0_59800.wav	so my longest delay is true	dev
audio_0_213564.wav	ok, ah, b	dev
audio_0_61566.wav	similarly, when you move in the y direction, you will be imagining grid like this moving in the other direction, right	dev
audio_0_56821.wav	now, one thing that you just try to understand from this ah diagram: suppose i have a source at one corner, lets say here, and my target is the other corner	dev
audio_0_220491.wav	Now, we again pick the smaller of the two	dev
audio_0_4612.wav	So, you find out R Thevenin is equal to V 0 by i 0	dev
audio_0_83665.wav	Differential mode gain is given by Ad; the gain is in differential mode, that is why it is d; then we have the symbol Ad for differential mode gain	dev
audio_0_174835.wav	Okay, let us look at remember that is the most what do you call lowest level activity you can say	dev
audio_0_53936.wav	in this tutorial i will be solving the first assignment	dev
audio_0_207608.wav	Anyway anywhere it moves, but it remains perpendicular to these two	dev
audio_0_56183.wav	let say, let us consider this cell, so lets call this was the target	dev
audio_0_214748.wav	for this, let's shift gears and understand what it means to monitor ball bearings inside rotating machinery	dev
audio_0_187142.wav	In fact, up 10 power minus 13 you will end up rejecting the null hypothesis	dev
audio_0_86911.wav	Now with SGX this secret key would only require that portions in the application which is boxed in this red dotted line and portions in the hardware is actually trusted	dev
audio_0_43370.wav	Well we cannot independently solve it because those edges finally, like the last look at this green triangle over here we	dev
audio_0_204708.wav	If I am rotating it in that direction this o' c' edge has to be resting on the ground	dev
audio_0_168011.wav	Now, if you see the value of i x, i x is nothing but minus of v naught by 2 because the direction of i x is opposite to natural flow of current if voltage v naught is having higher potential than the reference so in this way this will become minus of v naught by 2	dev
audio_0_148818.wav	So, to avoid such things here is a setup where it shows you and in this case I am angry, so it shows you that it is negative; other people can perceive your post just negative	dev
audio_0_27103.wav	So, we have to read a large volume of data which is already written on a file in the disk and the output we compute is typically return back into another file on the disk	dev
audio_0_180988.wav	So, basically depending on where there is capacity you sort of allocate more cells that is a very good solution that is one way by which we can do that any and you think of anything which is very very futuristic	dev
audio_0_64270.wav	see earlier when you laid out the network cables for those of you who have seen those thin and thick ethernet cables	dev
audio_0_181268.wav	Now, the number of interfering signals is the same i equal to 1 to i naught, this will be di rise to the power minus n the distance of the base station to the mobile	dev

audio_0_215795.wav	this memory bank is only writable if you want to specify a certain password	dev
audio_0_41968.wav	This is nothing but the position vector in spherical coordinates x y z those are the component	dev
audio_0_122730.wav	You're the eldest	dev
audio_0_210952.wav	Now can we visualize the object from the given views	dev
audio_0_100562.wav	The difference is in terms of what you do not get for reference	dev
audio_0_23981.wav	I have already briefed you about four stages of design thinking	dev
audio_0_25733.wav	There are cases where syn elimination takes place, but that is through a different kind of mechanism when 6 membered transition states are involved, then it could be syn elimination, but otherwise if there is this joint end are a base comes and attacks takes up the hydrogen and the X leaves then it is always the anti type of elimination that takes place, okay	dev
audio_0_91295.wav	So, that is how much of material it can accommodate that is the jig design and remaining three that is of size density and feed rate will determine that, what is the your weight of the material ah that volume it can accommodate ok at	dev
audio_0_98380.wav	We will talk about polymorphism later in the context of various C++ features	dev
audio_0_26099.wav	So, before we precede let us try and validate our claim that quicksort’s worst case behavior is actually tied to the description of the worst case input as in already sorted list	dev
audio_0_115270.wav	so its a we can look at as a grame where ah one side is that the consumer, which are a who are hungry for the resources or looking for the resources	dev
audio_0_143681.wav	So, we will get the average price	dev
audio_0_223832.wav	So, therefore now we have to solve or find a way of allocating the remaining bookings for some subset of the problem of the bookings	dev
audio_0_189876.wav	For example, the ring Z x is perfectly good ring, but it is not a principal ideal domain	dev
audio_0_227188.wav	So, feeler gauge; however, the scaled over the mechanic can just do it by itself, but the proper way is to use the feeler gauge of 0	dev
audio_0_104098.wav	So, a derived class of a base class is certainly not a part of that base class	dev
audio_0_59155.wav	so on top of the silicon we create the diffusion, then poly silicon, then several layers of metal	dev
audio_0_162801.wav	443 by b by lambda in degrees	dev
audio_0_20304.wav	But actually this is not a correct decision because the cost of research has already been taken, it is completely incurred and it is no way to reduce that cost now	dev
audio_0_200733.wav	In our numerical example we chose this to be 3 volts	dev
audio_0_223568.wav	So, basically there is a cost involve with setting up this sub problems and a cost to involved with combining the subproblems	dev
audio_0_67442.wav	in a culture dish they do divide, but in the body as of now we are not very sure when there are contradictory evidences but much of the hippocampal neurons, major ones, or motor neurons, they do not divide	dev
audio_0_207134.wav	Now, we would like to see the internal portion of that machine element	dev
audio_0_48447.wav	notice that if r small r equals capital r, this term cancels and you get one over r, which should be right	dev
audio_0_20719.wav	So, let us have a look at the calculation	dev
audio_0_90879.wav	In a similar way the return to LibC attack would overflow the buffer and then replace the return address with some other arbitrary address	dev
audio_0_179747.wav	How do I get capacity out of it water filling	dev
audio_0_100090.wav	I can have the reverse the double being assigned to i this will also allowed, but with a warning for the simple reason because double is a much bigger data type, whereas int is a smaller data type so, some data will be lost	dev
audio_0_197852.wav	The point is this current source, it is actually dissipating power	dev
audio_0_239027.wav	Promotions, Retention or Termination	dev
audio_0_69903.wav	So, cardiac cells have this classic feature they have series of gap junctions, and there is reason for we will come later in to that why there is those gap junctions are important because it is a structure where the electrical stimulation has to in a spread out in multiple direction like this, and it has its own function	dev
audio_0_211875.wav	so you have a set of p i r sensor from which, from algorithm that runs on it nice classifier, for instance between the animal and human, and that the classifier says: i found that this is a dog and now the and it gives a trigger to the camera and say: you go and check whether it is really a dog	dev
audio_0_99913.wav	So, the dynamic type of p A is also A	dev
audio_0_169841.wav	Now you have to keep in mind since we are talking about the DC voltage source it means that inductor will also be short circuited and capacitor will be open circuited	dev
audio_0_42329.wav	Let us look at it one by one, what is this guy	dev
audio_0_210446.wav	So, if it is 20 mm, locate this point	dev

audio_0_208157.wav	Connect minor axis elements with major axis elements and get the intersection lines from there construct this ellipse	dev
audio_0_57969.wav	b and d is sharing a common boundary, d and c is sharing a boundary, d and e is also sharing, and c and e is also sharing	dev
audio_0_2687.wav	And this is your ns minus n is your is the what you have to call that the relative speed and ns minus n 120 F2 upon P	dev
audio_0_6105.wav	Similarly, last one a n 1, x 1, a n 2, ah x 2 sorry a n 1, x 1, a n 2, x 2 up to a n n, x n it is a b n, right	dev
audio_0_173790.wav	If it is so, my CO3 is here, my assessment items are here then obviously there is no alignment between my outcome and the assessment items	dev
audio_0_18776.wav	So, you have to find out V C t V 0 t i 0 t	dev
audio_0_193513.wav	So, I can divide by 1 minus 2 y, but this is absurd, why is this absurd, for several reasons; one reason is that this is a rational number right because it is a ratio of two integers, it is rational number certainly square root minus 5 is not a rational number also this real number, but this cannot be a real number so that is another reason	dev
audio_0_24913.wav	When you say creativity that is what you would associate it with	dev
audio_0_192863.wav	Addition is defined here by adding in the target group, multiplication is defined to be composition	dev
audio_0_43756.wav	Yeah, individually each of them details	dev
audio_0_40912.wav	Za remains the same, usually, by reciprocity	dev
audio_0_84163.wav	And another are oscilloscopes, which are 2 on whichere I have my hand on 2 oscilloscopes, all right	dev
audio_0_50043.wav	so it's now vector product only and we'll calculate it	dev
audio_0_43872.wav	So, I can get E from here by simply the curl relation right	dev
audio_0_209933.wav	So, p' r 1' we will get it as 94 mm, let us calculate that	dev
audio_0_146117.wav	We need to bit of rewrite our program and we need to split this task into smaller tasks	dev
audio_0_95768.wav	but remember, frame only specific questions through which you can elicit answers	dev
audio_0_16806.wav	So, this I c current you are what you call a core loss component is there	dev
audio_0_179564.wav	So, it is a graph of 1 over gamma	dev
audio_0_102218.wav	We write it as arr i on the right, it is a vector of int we use the same indexing notation to access the array elements	dev
audio_0_108039.wav	When we look at trademarks, we also need to understand that trademarks are not a monopoly, in the sense that patents or copyright or designs are	dev
audio_0_57634.wav	so so each inverter is driving another inverter which is u times larger, which means the affective delay will be t p, zero t p	dev
audio_0_41959.wav	So, the first operator is the divergence	dev
audio_0_101570.wav	We have been discussing multiple inheritance and we have seen the basic mechanism of construction, destruction, layout, data members, member functions and what happens, if between the multiple base classes, if the data member or the member functions have duplicate same names	dev
audio_0_178988.wav	So, let us call this as C subscript outage; that means, with outage, this is equal to 1 minus probability of outage into B logarithm base 2 1 plus gamma min, right	dev
audio_0_7992.wav	So, you apply your KVL like these right you have apply KVL like this, if you if you have any confusion I can I can draw a different diag neat same diagram, but in different way	dev
audio_0_178642.wav	Psi of gamma MRC of s this is integral 0 through infinity, the definition the PDF times e power s gamma d gamma	dev
audio_0_226824.wav	So, the coil spring hinged and they placed it here	dev
audio_0_193284.wav	Now, what do I get	dev
audio_0_30362.wav	So, what do the kids do I mean; obviously, they will do something and sometimes in excitement they may become slightly overactive	dev
audio_0_188401.wav	We can see that this is full rank, because whatever multiple of the first column you take, you can never represent the second column and similarly whatever multiple of the first row you take you can never represent the second row, and this can also be seen from the fact that the determinant of A is not 0	dev
audio_0_15580.wav	3 actually shows the values of a dc current and then sine sudden ac current	dev
audio_0_30019.wav	Right it may be with phobia	dev
audio_0_216789.wav	let me redraw this	dev
audio_0_77357.wav	So, we quickly come and see how elasticity will change ok	dev
audio_0_166643.wav	Now when two conductors or you can say when two coils are in a close proximity to each other the magnetics plugs caused by the current in one coil links with the other coil and thereby it induces the voltage in the second coil and this particular phenomena is known as mutual inductance	dev
audio_0_30951.wav	Whole domain	dev
audio_0_186172.wav	You can see very clearly that the value reaches more or less or minimum at 2 and afterwards it does not significantly change	dev
audio_0_93530.wav	thank you once again	dev
audio_0_106330.wav	These were all amendments that brought the act in compliance with the TRIPS agreement of the WTO	dev
audio_0_180036.wav	So, that give us co channel interference that is a very very key	dev
audio_0_176174.wav	So there is a procedure to be followed and that is procedural knowledge	dev
audio_0_168368.wav	Now, larger super mesh can be used to apply Kirchhoff Voltage Law	dev
audio_0_39228.wav	Note that these are partial derivatives, because the function depends on all three variables this only text the derivative with respect to one of the variables	dev

audio_0_173964.wav	Some purists believe there should never be summative assessment, there should only be formative assessment	dev
audio_0_152692.wav	At the same time we also have to be aware that cultural variations in the interpretation as well as in the allied usages of a particularly common hand movement are also there	dev
audio_0_63793.wav	so here we are trying to avoid the sharing of resources as much as possible	dev
audio_0_143579.wav	So, any amount which is spent for change of location or change of condition, then that can be added for calculating the cost of inventory	dev
audio_0_40387.wav	1 with respect to z 0 ok	dev
audio_0_236099.wav	Where are, these goods made, etcetera	dev
audio_0_224941.wav	So, for instants if you want to delete 65, then we will search for 65 find it by the usual mechanism of following the left and right paths	dev
audio_0_65117.wav	so, although it looks like the lengths are equal, but there can be some parasitic, resistance and capacitance effects, right, and these parastics may not be the same for both the lines because it depends on the lines which are running parallel to those lines on the same layer across different layers	dev
audio_0_150887.wav	So the question that you can ask yourself is how do I put, how do you put your own accounts together to find out whether they're same or not	dev
audio_0_117247.wav	so what we see that it is	dev
audio_0_163291.wav	Suppose, I want what is the value of this point, so what I will have to do, from here I will have to put a vertical line that line will intersect some point like this circle	dev
audio_0_99212.wav	Stack is a LIFO structure; last in first out container that maintain a collection of arbitrary number of data items	dev
audio_0_104896.wav	So, a typical format bit structure has been created	dev
audio_0_149476.wav	Similarly, we will define data 2 for the second user; similarly, we will define the data values for all the 5 users for each of the four days	dev
audio_0_191322.wav	Remember, what is known about a and I, a it is in I intersection J; that means, it is in I as well as it is in J	dev
audio_0_191164.wav	Because, we are dividing by n the remainder will be strictly less than m; but now notice an interesting thing, n is in I by choice; that means, nq is in I, m is in I, by also choice right; that means, m minus nq is n I	dev
audio_0_210219.wav	This kind of things, I have to make it on certain object; and, those information we have to teach it to the computer at every each and every point and for that purpose, usually this wireframe designs or drawings will be helpful	dev
audio_0_28081.wav	This is a completely different style of programming which is called Declarative programming and you can look it up	dev
audio_0_92524.wav	So, now, we will continue with the different notions of convergence, the first one which we have already seen in this previous lecture, where for each point x in the interval minus L to L, we were talking about the sum of the series converging to this average value of the limits of the function at x	dev
audio_0_175089.wav	But if I am not even aware of it, if I do not even know my own emotion, I do not have control over my reactions or activities	dev
audio_0_180647.wav	Let us just write down a few more points that are helpful for us to get the complete picture	dev
audio_0_218069.wav	ok, so let us consider a case where we are going to energize an inductor	dev
audio_0_157011.wav	So the total number of transfers, therefore, is 3Br plus BS plus 4N	dev
audio_0_149735.wav	It cannot be more than that, whereas in Facebook it can be large text as I showed you when I was going on Facebook	dev
audio_0_61089.wav	one is on the left, x one, other is on the right, x, two	dev
audio_0_230025.wav	So, here is your eye so, here is a prism	dev
audio_0_101494.wav	I cannot change it anymore, because if I make it private then naturally I will not be able to change that value of the number of jobs or the number of pages in the tray	dev
audio_0_101400.wav	Now in terms of accessing a static data member we will need to use the class name because as I have already mentioned here that it is associated with a class and not with the object	dev
audio_0_196442.wav	You can see that again the equations are exactly the same	dev
audio_0_220534.wav	So, we want this corresponds to saying is that we are actually giving a strategy for choosing when we have two equal things	dev
audio_0_148411.wav	XML, which is also a format with some social media services give, or the JSON, is also a little bit like an XML, which is Extended Mark up Language	dev
audio_0_235426.wav	How do employees, define success	dev
audio_0_1889.wav	And this is your omega t, and this is the voltage phase voltage right	dev
audio_0_120166.wav	And in fact, the people who play this, you know, hordes of people who play this will always meet with a bad end	dev
audio_0_226949.wav	These are all tasks for yourself learning, ok, in the examination you can have questions based on these tasks, whatever I have been giving tasks to students and more than that if you start understanding all these tasks, ok, then you will start appreciating the measurement science, ok	dev
audio_0_175276.wav	And attainments generally we are using class average marks as the attainment of a CO associated with that PO is 100% then the attainment of PO is 1	dev
audio_0_166117.wav	So, in many situation the circuit is designed to provide the power to the load	dev
audio_0_233395.wav	The documentation of poor performance, followed by counselling and remedial measures, should be done, before the punishment is given	dev
audio_0_21587.wav	Now, we will need the inventory of April, I mean sale of April which is 18 based on that compute the inventory for March	dev
audio_0_92333.wav	There will be one more integral transform, the Laplace transform will be discussing in this lecture in this module	dev
audio_0_148481.wav	So, this is what we will use this is what we will actually talk about mostly in the section called phishing	dev
audio_0_64999.wav	let us first calculate the zero force x coordinate according to the equation we derived	dev
audio_0_62711.wav	ok, so the floorplanning problem part, say, does not exist in standard cell designs	dev
audio_0_186650.wav	We have covered the plot function earlier in the visualization in r section, now the input to the plot function are basically x and y	dev
audio_0_34713.wav	So, what happens of we will just take the first term, what happens of the first term	dev
audio_0_95389.wav	now, in order to have a communication effective, what we actually can say is a communication that serves a requisite purpose	dev
audio_0_20483.wav	I'm saying normally because there can be curves of various shapes also	dev
audio_0_186016.wav	However, this is a point which would satisfy this equation of the line	dev
audio_0_38404.wav	So, what I could do is substitute this exponential term into this finite difference equation	dev
audio_0_168962.wav	Now the term convolution, how you will define, the two signals which consists of time reversing of one of the signals, shifting it and multiplying it point by point with the second signal then and integrating the product then the output would be the convolution of two signals	dev
audio_0_146556.wav	Mars Pathfinder landed on the Mars surface on 4th July 1997	dev
audio_0_208400.wav	Once that is done we have to construct transfer this lengths, the vertical lengths where they are going to intersect	dev
audio_0_100557.wav	Reference does not need that because it is, if it exists, then it is alias of something or it does not exist	dev
audio_0_164106.wav	so, if you see this circuit you will see if these are the 2 terminals of the circuit	dev
audio_0_144562.wav	Then we will get the cash flow from operating activities	dev
audio_0_128363.wav	We have milli amps squared here, so this is 10 to the minus 6, this is 10 to the 3	dev
audio_0_230796.wav	So, this entire height is now 29	dev
audio_0_163502.wav	So, V 1 will be z 11 I 1 plus z 12 I 2 and V 2 will be z 21 I 1 plus z 22 I 2	dev
audio_0_93377.wav	m, either he or i m to be blamed, m to be either he or i m to ah be blamed to be blamed, isnt it	dev
audio_0_50362.wav	so in the case of electric field we had a scalar potential, v r, which is also interpreter as the work done in the case of magnetic field	dev
audio_0_167119.wav	Now, if the blocks are in parallel combination means two systems are said to be in parallel when they have common input and their outputs are combined by a summing junction	dev
audio_0_174300.wav	And that is what an engineer needs to at least feel sensitized to that	dev
audio_0_64358.wav	so the last buffer will be driving, driving a set of clock pins, clock terminals	dev
audio_0_102343.wav	So, it becomes easier to use it in that way	dev
audio_0_71964.wav	No, because it's just ongoing	dev
audio_0_159794.wav	So the system essentially stops and none of the transactions can finish and none of the transactions can therefore finish successfully	dev
audio_0_175070.wav	For example why should I accept this and make it part of my, what do you call my mindset	dev
audio_0_115652.wav	and we will try to look at in our next ah lecture or so that, how, what are the implications or what are the specialty ah of this ah security in case of cloud computing	dev
audio_0_208309.wav	It is intersecting this point; let us call that point as our b 1	dev
audio_0_18111.wav	To get the Norton equivalent circuit first what you do R Norton R Norton is equal to R thevenin; that means, current source is open and voltage source is shorted right; that means, if you if you now if it is like this, then you can see that this is open	dev
audio_0_231023.wav	So, this is a Standard, this is an unknown variable, unknown part or product whatever it is it comes here	dev
audio_0_103952.wav	If I am writing the current value of a complex number I will need to read the r e i n component and then so on	dev
audio_0_227160.wav	Next I will discuss about this surface plate	dev
audio_0_1679.wav	So, 10 into i 2 minus i 1 and then encountering minus terminal, first of this 10 volt source; so, minus 10; so, here it is minus 10 is equal to 0; that means, i 1 minus 2, i 2 is equal to minus 1, this is equation 1	dev
audio_0_87706.wav	Okay, so note that the each of these gadgets has a few instructions and then has a return or a returnf or call instruction at the end	dev
audio_0_95479.wav	then comes the certain factors that can make you a better communicator	dev
audio_0_86022.wav	The stack would contain the function parameters, it would contain the return address, then it would have a frame pointer and then the local variables for that invoked function	dev
audio_0_74061.wav	So, one way is to track the net distance that these cells travel over that duration	dev
audio_0_59261.wav	so there can be other wires running in parallel on the same layer	dev
audio_0_118276.wav	right, it is a of a particular level, says i, ninety nine percent, ninety nine point percent, and so and so forth, which will be supported by the cloud	dev
audio_0_76520.wav	So, this RGD is actually hidden within this structure	dev
audio_0_99632.wav	This will now give me a stack of characters which I can use this	dev
audio_0_68958.wav	One of the critical parts of all these things that we are trying to rebuilt a system in a dish a small prototype of it maybe in a two dimension and in future in a three dimension	dev
audio_0_212020.wav	the other sensor node is only interested to know if there is a motion that is detected and it will do its own ah processing	dev
audio_0_220900.wav	And unless I do this, I cannot really use for Dijskstra's algorithm because DijskstraÕs algorithm will ask us to update value in the heap, but I need to know which value in the heap I need to update	dev
audio_0_74340.wav	So, one of the ways of doing it, one of the ways of doing it is actually to measure the cells spread area as a function of stiffness	dev
audio_0_234888.wav	And, the stress, we take on ourselves, that can result in health related issues, comes down	dev
audio_0_86367.wav	The second thing is to sent, E1 as an input to test code this is done as follows	dev
audio_0_65809.wav	So, please be careful whenever you set up the thing think, think calm quite think over it how you really want the facility, because your facility looks nice you can bring people and finally, the end user they will be happy you know this is a very systematic facility, and one more thing these kind of facilities takes a lot of soul to be put there	dev
audio_0_172656.wav	Knowledge is dynamic unbalanced conditions	dev
audio_0_191957.wav	So, it must be 0 in other words reminder is 0	dev
audio_0_146793.wav	Utilization due to T2 is 1 by 5 and utilization due to T3 is 5 by 20 which is 1 by 4	dev
audio_0_162402.wav	So, this needs to be solved, but you know this, already we have solved this equation earlier	dev
audio_0_89328.wav	Let us say that the payload that the attacker wants to execute is as follows	dev
audio_0_58169.wav	so what we are doing is that we are trying to decrease the slacks to zero by increasing t v and t e	dev
audio_0_143573.wav	So, cost of inventory, one obvious part is the cost at which we have purchased or the cost of acquisition	dev
audio_0_30235.wav	Because there may be other factors contributing to increase in OCD which I think, maybe we can talk about it in continuation	dev
audio_0_145728.wav	Can’t the programming itself we write so that it monitors the event and responds without operating system	dev
audio_0_213606.wav	because you go into a departmental store there are millions and millions of times which are tagged	dev
audio_0_166732.wav	Now let solve few of the circuits so that we can understand how you can involve the mutual inductance in our circuit analyses	dev
audio_0_206091.wav	So, this entire part, this part, this one, this one, this one entirely we will see it like a straight line	dev
audio_0_196485.wav	But we will stick to this so that all these quantities come out to be positive, as long as you know which direction it is in, it should be fine	dev
audio_0_207242.wav	It is always convenient to show it in this 2 dimensional framework instead of showing this 3 D picture	dev
audio_0_220804.wav	For instance, you might want to penalize movements which take you across large segments of the array	dev
audio_0_121245.wav	Janab, don't make excuses, don't use these ruses	dev
audio_0_100734.wav	At any point of time, if you have a thrown from here it has been passed on throw this and now you are you are working on f you know that for g and h the two functions that have thrown all local objects have been properly cleaned up	dev
audio_0_14924.wav	So, for and for DC ah we have seen that capacitor ah acts as a open circuit and ah for the inductor it will act as a short circuit right	dev
audio_0_168114.wav	You will get another value of average power but that would be absorbed by a particular element in this case we have the resistor but the source is DC, so we have some power dissipated by the resistor would be say, we say that the current at this point is I effective, so this will become P is nothing but I effective square R	dev
audio_0_225437.wav	So, this becomes our worst case input	dev
audio_0_142153.wav	Now we will go to the next item that is known as owner's fund	dev
audio_0_190332.wav	So, this K map when we talked about field homomorphisms, so show that any field homomorphism sigma from K to L is an F homomorphism right	dev
audio_0_235849.wav	And, one takes on the responsibility, for managing one's own career, as opposed to, waiting for the organization, to promote us	dev
audio_0_171593.wav	This energy is supplied by the supplied through the external emf that is provided by the battery	dev
audio_0_130203.wav	i mean coal can be used, or a natural gas can be used to generate electricity	dev
audio_0_233997.wav	Some questions, that one needs to ask, to measure these effects are, have the trainees achieve the specific level of skill, knowledge, or performance	dev
audio_0_186756.wav	Now let us assume that all the circular data belong to one category and all the starred data, belong to another category	dev
audio_0_52485.wav	so i am at a point here which is s phi and z, and its position is given by vector r, which is s s plus z z	dev
audio_0_203539.wav	You similar to rectangle how corner to corner we have constructed, corner to corner parallelogram also we can construct it	dev
audio_0_212801.wav	so lets see what actually happens there	dev
audio_0_175072.wav	After the judgment then it becomes you are willing to accept it as your own	dev
audio_0_135484.wav	Now, as far as the Berlin conference was concerned, we also need to keep in mind that, though it decided the fate of Africa and its inhabitants, the conference was never really motivated by any special concern about Africans	dev
audio_0_123784.wav	you open circuit the capacitor and short circuit inductors	dev
audio_0_134846.wav	You see 0	dev
audio_0_183629.wav	But notice that you are interested in variations in time dimension for the different delays	dev
audio_0_163430.wav	So, that has been put plot here, E phi by cos theta and it shows like this	dev
audio_0_138217.wav	So obviously you are going to have difference in these, difference in these properties for example here you have a larger gain and here you have a larger time constant too, here you have a smaller gain here you have a, no, here you have a smaller gain and you have a smaller time constant here you have a larger gain and you have a larger time constant right, larger gain and a smaller time constant, so you will get different properties, so what is the assessment of these closed loop methods that some trial and error is needed	dev
audio_0_96027.wav	you know, no one would like a lengthy letter	dev
audio_0_31887.wav	So, these four equations, we have all seen before	dev
audio_0_203487.wav	Now, we will go and create another kind of rectangle whenever we would like to construct different things we use	dev
audio_0_183608.wav	Now, the design of the interleaver and the FEC needs to take into account; probably a more closely what is the duration of a fade average duration of a fade and then correspondingly work with that	dev
audio_0_136336.wav	Indeed, much before the Indian middle class came into the picture there were other social groups like the tribals for instance or the peasants who were regularly agitating against the colonial rule in India	dev
audio_0_224943.wav	Now, sometimes a deleted node might have only one child, for instance supposing we delete 74	dev
audio_0_92133.wav	So, we can have a finite number of smooth curves and there are sharp corners	dev
audio_0_184931.wav	So therefore, I would like to calculate the Ergodic capacity	dev
audio_0_28121.wav	Here we have a function f which reads the values x and prints it by storing it in the name y, Now the question is: what is this x	dev
audio_0_84246.wav	It is very easy to operate, that is what I am I am showing it to you	dev
audio_0_59900.wav	if so, it will also tell you for what combination of the inputs the function is one	dev
audio_0_39196.wav	If I want to do a draw one to one analogy between this guy and this guy what is my psi	dev
audio_0_201490.wav	From here to here whatever length is there that's represented by 4 units	dev
audio_0_216131.wav	so lets go back to the code and let us see essentially what happens in the code, the ah	dev
audio_0_19387.wav	So, we have to take a decision for pricing for a school picnic	dev
audio_0_213474.wav	so if you do this, you are actually reading the i r m s a ah register	dev
audio_0_95832.wav	if ah below that, if you write the ah inside address, once again, there is no need of putting any punctuation	dev
audio_0_39579.wav	So, this is as I mentioned is written in a language called scheme which is a slightly unusual language	dev
audio_0_79291.wav	So, this will really help you to identify how these proteins are located along the x y z plane	dev
audio_0_90091.wav	Over here we see the disassembly for this particular function and as we know there is a preamble in the function where the stack frame is created for this particular function, there are space for the local variables over here and finally the function returns	dev
audio_0_97783.wav	I do not have a using on namespace name 2	dev
audio_0_37914.wav	As I mentioned once again earlier we want to reduce pain in calculations	dev

audio_0_220379.wav	This is a very powerful claim	dev
audio_0_141379.wav	We are very simple example let's suppose there is an auto rickshaw driver	dev
audio_0_42554.wav	I want to know the field somewhere outside here right that is where I want to find out the field	dev
audio_0_81484.wav	But just to quickly recall, external components R 1 and R 2 form a close loop, right	dev
audio_0_173551.wav	The institution uses the results of calculating the attainment of outcomes to continuously improve the levels of outcome attainment	dev
audio_0_61064.wav	and this process is continued because all the blocks are successively moved from the ceiling to the floor	dev
audio_0_83672.wav	Whatever is the gain of value of Ad; my difference voltage would be amplified by that particular gain and that is why Ad is called the differential mode gain	dev
audio_0_220772.wav	So, they may be got 60, 43, 60 and 95, now we might want to sort this by marks	dev
audio_0_98995.wav	So, this is if this is a type then this p is a declaration or pointer declaration of type T colon colon name	dev
audio_0_173148.wav	That is working with standards	dev
audio_0_222843.wav	So, if you want this exact size balance, then it is very restricted	dev
audio_0_228244.wav	So, we have got the origin point here that is the centre point origin point here the centre point the centre in a region	dev
audio_0_73294.wav	So the other remaining two steps are we will see first, then we will see the risk evaluation	dev
audio_0_231291.wav	And take care of time leakage	dev
audio_0_66885.wav	So, now getting back how this problem was targeted	dev
audio_0_173926.wav	And another one is “repetition”	dev
audio_0_114515.wav	so we will continue our discussion on overview of computing and evolution of ah cloud computing	dev
audio_0_219650.wav	So, we have seen how to explore connectivity using breadth first search	dev
audio_0_164371.wav	So if it is Z1, Z2, Z3 the equivalent impedance if you have to find out it is better to take the reciprocal of impedances	dev
audio_0_21171.wav	It tries to keep those costs in check, tries to control the cost	dev
audio_0_171112.wav	Now, here since y 12 is equal to y 21 so you can use either y 12 or y 21 both are, both will hold true and then the branch which is connecting these two legs will have the admittance equal to minus of y 12	dev
audio_0_29653.wav	But I must now thank you because we began with something as angry as anger , but the discourse that we took it did cover a lot of things	dev
audio_0_74088.wav	If the cell was huge then this kind of localized protrusion would not lead to accumulation of membrane tension as a consequences cell would not move forward	dev
audio_0_75910.wav	So, subsequently there have been lot of studies, but the question automatically arose that what would happen to other cell types if they were placed in such environments, and spreading is of the order of a you know 5 – 6 hours cell spread what would happen to longer time events	dev
audio_0_32697.wav	Same direction right	dev
audio_0_214557.wav	so ah, m c u s that use monos	dev

audio_0_6284.wav	So, it is voltage here is v 2 so, it will basically v 2 minus 0 by 12, so, that means, it is actually v 2 by 12 this is your i 1	dev
audio_0_201638.wav	If there are something like position dimensions with respect to position dimensions locate L the center of circles under the key features	dev
audio_0_96131.wav	then comes letter report, then there is circular, then we have electronic mails	dev
audio_0_59878.wav	now, timing simulation, as we have seen, obviously does not satisfy this property	dev
audio_0_214980.wav	ah, here you talk about beacon technology and the variable space, which is an interesting thing	dev
audio_0_28813.wav	So, you want to say that two genes sequences or two organisms are similar, if there are large overlaps over the entire genome not just looking for individuals segment along, but by just throwing away the minimal things on both sides, we can make that align as we call	dev
audio_0_141164.wav	And that social moderator okay, tells you whether to fight or not, that means that even though you are biologically ready for an act, socially your brain controls you	dev
audio_0_27646.wav	Although this is now structurally correct, it does not have the right value distribution	dev
audio_0_222093.wav	So, remember that we have trying to grow the yellow partition is the lower partition	dev
audio_0_99496.wav	So, if you look into this class then you will find that; let me put it clearly	dev
audio_0_173893.wav	These are all the cognitive activities a human can perform	dev
audio_0_104044.wav	So, given that, now we say that the manager is an employee through this form	dev
audio_0_154694.wav	For example, performance feel more relaxed in a green room and weightlifters do their best in blue colored gyms, but beyond this in the professional world it is our choice of colors through different accessories which we carry on our body that we reflect our personality and our attitudes to other	dev
audio_0_92788.wav	And we have in that case once we show that these conditions are satisfied, one can get such a potential function with the process which we have seen in the previous example	dev
audio_0_121007.wav	The first crisis which led to Ravta going back home in a huff is about borrowing clothes from the clothes shop on credit	dev

audio_0_65334.wav	via connection can exist between any pair of layers or for routing, we are more interested in metal to metal connections via connections between adjacent metal layers	dev
audio_0_237303.wav	Sometimes, your organization may not have the resources, to conduct several layers of interviews	dev
audio_0_39133.wav	No, right because I have said the sources are on the surface of the conductor and the r that I have chosen is on the axis of the conductor right	dev
audio_0_239022.wav	So, salary administration	dev
audio_0_185674.wav	We have the same function we have defined now an extra argument radius in the function and the volume calculation does not involve this argument radius in this calculation	dev

audio_0_211777.wav	if there are so many other vendors which provide you solutions where essentially, you can talk to the device and the device will find out ah, get you information and perhaps tell you about whether, tell you about cooking recipes and so on and so forth, so many nice things it does ah	dev
audio_0_191178.wav	And, hence m is divisible by n which is another way of saying m is a multiple of n right	dev
audio_0_178655.wav	Now, there is a standard result which I am not sure if we have already mentioned it, but if not you can just not it down	dev
audio_0_76660.wav	So, they do not really come as a consequence of your domain suggesting that, this long stretch in between is the signature which is representative of your protein construct, but you do not know whether this is really coming from A because B has not contributed	dev
audio_0_17270.wav	So, i 2 plus i 3 is equal to 8 right	dev

audio_0_184565.wav	So, not either required or it is going to be simple low complexity	dev
audio_0_116013.wav	total service, total service down time is five hours plus thirty minutes plus one hour thirty minute plus fifteen minute plus two hours twenty five minute	dev
audio_0_93916.wav	that also tells a lot about your control and your power, as well as your dominance	dev
audio_0_189869.wav	So, I will start logistic regression in the next lecture and I hope to see you then	dev
audio_0_104490.wav	But if p is pointing to a d object here then it has a different function pointer, virtual function table pointer	dev
audio_0_187944.wav	So, basically we are saying y and x are associated with each other also there is a strong association	dev
audio_0_29235.wav	2f, this whole thing to the right of the colon tells me how to format the values comes from here	dev
audio_0_235885.wav	So, the identification can be done, through the career anchors	dev
audio_0_2859.wav	That means, this one can be written as r 2 dash plus you take r 2 dash common it will be one upon s minus one right	dev
audio_0_152244.wav	So, they used the faces and the Facebook data that were collected from the experiment 1 and 2 with the public data to predict the Social Security Number	dev
audio_0_129938.wav	for instance, lets say you had a circuit whose y parameters are given, or you have calculated them already	dev
audio_0_101623.wav	So, that is the basic way to construct a multiple inheritance hierarchy	dev
audio_0_49639.wav	our concern is that k is being switched off	dev
audio_0_182138.wav	So, that is says I am not going to use this type of a jammer I am going to use a very strong tone as my jammer	dev
audio_0_235907.wav	It involves, determining the type of career, that employees want	dev
audio_0_178321.wav	So, the notion of coherence time we made a very intuitive description of this; earlier when we are looking a talking about the say Tse and Viswanath example today we are going to formalize it	dev
audio_0_71068.wav	Here the project manager provides a justification for starting the project and shows that the benefit of the project exceeds the costs and also identifies the business risks	dev
audio_0_211574.wav	you are getting about maximum of about hundred and twenty micro joules of energy	dev
audio_0_42790.wav	So, we will assume that these delta l and delta y quantities are small such that the electric field is constant along these edges alright	dev
audio_0_152167.wav	They used this tool called pittpatt dot com, which was face recognizing tool	dev
audio_0_197542.wav	So what must happen is the following	dev
audio_0_199830.wav	No current flows into the gate but R1 and R2 appear between gate and ground	dev
audio_0_51686.wav	if you put alpha is equal to two, here it will become minus four	dev
audio_0_27245.wav	If we will take the slice from 0 up to minus 1 then it will correctly exclude the last character from the string	dev
audio_0_171618.wav	So, what we have to do for practical purpose we need to know how much power an electric device can handle, because when you pay your electricity bill you pay electricity bill in the form of how many units you have consumed	dev
audio_0_203944.wav	So, we can see over here aligned in the correct way	dev
audio_0_172997.wav	Same solution in one context maybe desirable and the consequences in some other context it will be different	dev
audio_0_187794.wav	Welcome to the lectures in Data Analytics	dev
audio_0_231796.wav	He left drinking long ago; wrong form	dev
audio_0_70383.wav	So, here in this content financial analysis, this will combine, this section will combine the various costs and benefit data to establish what will the real value of the project, whether the project can be accepted by the end user not, whether the project can be accepted by the developer not by comparing the cost and benefits	dev
audio_0_198658.wav	But it turns out that in most cases we can do better than this	dev
audio_0_71034.wav	This is also called as the cost benefit feasibility	dev
audio_0_60433.wav	so so, as i had said that these techniques try to exploit some changes at the algorithmic level, so we have not yet made the design again, these methods may not be very general, they may not be applicable to all designs, but for many of the designs which which appear quite commonly, you can use them like, for example, we will be illustrating these approaches with respect to design of a binary counter, how we can carry out state encoding in an efficient way for low power, then how we can carry out state encoding for finite state machines and clock gating in f s ms	dev
audio_0_222161.wav	But it does not matter how we choose them so long as we can establish the fact that beyond a certain n 0 there is a uniform constant c such that c times g of n dominates t of n	dev
audio_0_37061.wav	So now, that we have done this let us try to convert equations 1 2 3 using our central difference idea	dev
audio_0_156952.wav	And similarly, if ABE today lives from this institution and so that there is only one teacher who is deleted, there are two tuples that needs to be deleted and so on so forth	dev
audio_0_40232.wav	Even if I fix a large number of N, is there any other problem conceptually that you can see	dev
audio_0_199575.wav	Now, the incremental part here, the extra over this 5	dev
audio_0_222978.wav	So, when we communicate, we have to transmit information from one place to another place	dev
audio_0_12950.wav	So, 20 plus 20 so 40 that is 1 by 4 ampere	dev
audio_0_145430.wav	But then there are two problems which really stand out	dev
audio_0_19267.wav	A general manager may have more level of authority to take more decisions	dev
audio_0_58497.wav	so you see, for this fault we have obtained a test vector: zero, zero, zero, dont care	dev
audio_0_43701.wav	So, this is the 1D problem; that means, the wave is going like this along the x direction right	dev
audio_0_186379.wav	So, we have got an idea about how R Studio looks	dev
audio_0_143670.wav	Now, most of the cases, companies have to pay tax on profits	dev
audio_0_79423.wav	Or you have gamma soarcoglycan deficient mouse	dev
audio_0_112238.wav	So, if I want a by a single part I want a clock wise pulling I should have a l S in the series arm and then if I want a clockwise pulling that should be in a parallel branch it is a CP	dev
audio_0_94239.wav	maybe they give you ten days and these ten days you are preparing ah, you are using all your might to show that you are a powerful debater	dev
audio_0_38049.wav	Now supposing I substitute u is equal to 0 v is equal to 0 what happens	dev
audio_0_153760.wav	If you look at this video the connotations of his face become clear to us	dev
audio_0_6493.wav	So, if the if this is the direction of the current, if my thumb is the direction of the current, then flux line will be the curling this curling finger right	dev
audio_0_221249.wav	So, we have this update rule and we do these blindly n times and n we claim that the matrix W in the entry k has got the correct shortest paths for all pairs of vertices	dev
audio_0_59116.wav	so from here you have to take an output, and this output can be taken on different layers	dev
audio_0_59906.wav	ok, now, this is what i mentioned, that a boolean function is given in product of some form and a sat solver will try to find out some values of the variables for which f equal to one	dev
audio_0_208397.wav	Draw few more lines	dev
audio_0_21437.wav	What has happened is we have increased the capacity utilization of Y, cut down Z and you can see there is a substantial increase in profit from 235 to 335	dev
audio_0_87844.wav	So what we actually achieve over here is that even before completing the execution of this compare and jump on no zero instructions the processor could have actually speculatively executed these set of instructions and then commit these instructions only when the result of compare and jump on no 0 is obtained	dev
audio_0_235063.wav	I do not think, there is any machine, that uses those, anymore	dev
audio_0_228287.wav	So, I am putting this movement; that means to, if you see this is A 90 B 180, ok	dev
audio_0_135772.wav	And, as by now, I am sure you will know, my favourite habit is to first to go to a dictionary and see what the dictionary tells us	dev
audio_0_28181.wav	Of course, the same rules apply so if we look up x inside g or h	dev
audio_0_144125.wav	But as far as the accounting is concerned, the whole of business life is divided into certain periods which are known as accounting periods	dev
audio_0_105432.wav	So that ensures that no employee instance can be constructed which gives us comfort because we do not know what would it have meant to construct an instance of an employee because we do not have any details about that	dev
audio_0_49605.wav	in the previous lecture we have introduced poynting vector for electromagnetic fields and shown that this is equal to one over mu, zero, e, cross b and is equal to the energy flow per unit area per unit time or power per unit area	dev
audio_0_164720.wav	Now, similarly for various outputs that is I ranging from 1 to q you can write these equations	dev
audio_0_69972.wav	So, you see technique is one, but one has to ask the right set of questions or I study there is another side which is previous to this one I put this is A as a B side	dev
audio_0_24332.wav	We have seen this digital transformation of entering content digitally through keyboards and typing basically, the whole activity of writing has been transformed to typing nowadays to have a digital copy or a digital saved content or something like that	dev
audio_0_115774.wav	one is that server rack design is a important aspects and there is separately, if you look at do not, the cloud computing part	dev
audio_0_61810.wav	so here the area of the channel can be like this: lets say k by k, but in this case, for ten x, the area of the channel will be ten k by ten k	dev
audio_0_169702.wav	So, what we can say v1 is equal to minus 10 cost 50 t plus 50 degree can be converted as plus 10 cost 50 t plus 50 minus 180 degree	dev
audio_0_213041.wav	that is there	dev
audio_0_202764.wav	On this perpendicular line what we have to do point d is 20 mm below horizontal plane; that means, if we are projecting that 20 mm onto vertical plane at a 20 mm distance we will mark this front view	dev
audio_0_141897.wav	Total non current liabilities have of course fallen in line from 33 to 24	dev
audio_0_19712.wav	If you want to achieve target profit of 22 lakhs, check what contribution you must earn	dev
audio_0_33233.wav	So, why did not I do this earlier	dev
audio_0_187811.wav	You can also define the cross covariance which is denoted by S xy which is nothing but the deviation of x i from x bar and the corresponding deviation of y i from y bar and the product of this we take and sum over all values and divide by n	dev
audio_0_8442.wav	So, you apply KVL	dev
audio_0_104730.wav	And, it is typical that it gives you a value at the end of computation; we say it returns a result	dev
audio_0_119607.wav	the master maintains regular communication with the chunk server	dev
audio_0_211321.wav	so you have to actually find out what is your harvesting opportunity in terms of the temperature differential	dev
audio_0_209493.wav	So, for surface constructions we have seen how these polygons are helpful in terms of better visualization	dev
audio_0_223277.wav	So, we have seen three algorithms so far which follow this greedy paradigm	dev
audio_0_146404.wav	We will see through some examples and then we find the frame sizes which can be used and then we choose the largest of those because that will minimize the overhead due to the scheduler	dev
audio_0_29674.wav	Cases of other kinds of physical atrocities on the weaker section, on women	dev
audio_0_237642.wav	Of course, documentary evidences supporting is, likely to get you the results, that you need	dev
audio_0_116197.wav	there is another thing is that if there is a apparatus and needs and something has to be there, like suppose i, i am using a algo for finding a minimum ah path or minimum distance between point a and point b on a typical ah map, then i can ah	dev
audio_0_158476.wav	Then the answer to that it is about log b based 2 6 and that many transfers because these are random jumps so that many six for each of this block we require a seek and a transfer so that is the answer	dev
audio_0_8741.wav	So, the 3 phase induction motor has 2 main parts	dev
audio_0_235917.wav	In this lecture, we will be touching upon, a very, very, important topic, that is very close to my heart	dev
audio_0_194661.wav	And you can see in this case that this is the gate, drain and source terminal of the most transistor, the input is applied between source and ground, the output is taken between drain and ground, and the gate is grounded	dev
audio_0_93732.wav	you know most of us, most of us, rather	dev
audio_0_60930.wav	suppose i have a layout, i have my left edge, i left to right, i make a scan	dev
audio_0_140905.wav	Then I might commit error now the eco cultural frame work berry and his collogues they talk about	dev

audio_0_57594.wav	so with respect to this, let us try to estimate what will be the total propagation delay of this pair of inverters	dev
audio_0_190714.wav	So, what I mean is so let me write that here	dev
audio_0_46859.wav	So in the case the forward transformer, I will say this is the primary which is connected to V In and then you have the secondary and you also have the third winding with the D Manet is winding will come to that later because that contains almost negligible power	dev
audio_0_25877.wav	Finally, python offers us a very useful alternative clause called else	dev
audio_0_205544.wav	Now, this object we remove, but we would like to really view that on the projection plane	dev

audio_0_181329.wav	So, typically the combination is what is important, what does your MS ISDN contain	dev
audio_0_95029.wav	now, when you keep all these things into consideration, i understand that your presentation is going to be effective	dev
audio_0_165239.wav	Now, you have written this value in terms of current converts them in terms of voltage, so what you will do	dev
audio_0_175272.wav	They can also be normalized to any other number	dev
audio_0_164935.wav	So we can summaries that the relationship between the voltage sources and current sources would be Vs is equal to is into R or is is equal to Vs by R when we have to go for source transformation	dev
audio_0_202012.wav	So, let us select this Z direction	dev
audio_0_48851.wav	But, all other the points they have the same, all the points have same y and z b c	dev
audio_0_149500.wav	We would need to follow the same steps as before	dev
audio_0_174882.wav	You are just producing the, reproducing the curves	dev
audio_0_224605.wav	On the other hand, this process can make the algorithm more obscure and many programming languages actually or optimizing compilers can try to do this automatically	dev
audio_0_88831.wav	Okay, so this is all that we need for a very basic return to libc attack	dev
audio_0_10319.wav	So, this is simply your what you call is simple geometry, you can make it out all this things right	dev
audio_0_21826.wav	you know, few years back there was a suicide incidents reported in the campus	dev
audio_0_27584.wav	Based on linear structures that we already studied, we can think of maintaining these jobs just as a list	dev
audio_0_10424.wav	So, ; that means equation 13 we can state that the time constant of a circuit is the time required for the response to decay, 36	dev
audio_0_230731.wav	Now I have converted an end measurement into a linear measurement or an end another end measurement	dev
audio_0_146334.wav	Of course, we have shown this for our understanding but then in a real task table we need not write the frame number etc so we just store the sequence in which the task to be executed	dev
audio_0_72168.wav	It typically maintains it in the form of a spread set and usually created during the sprint planning meeting	dev
audio_0_63889.wav	so when the clock becomes zero, like what i am saying, is that suppose my clock signal is like this and lets say, my d signal changes, because of some reason it changes and it remains stable like that	dev
audio_0_145494.wav	In the assignment problem, we first decide which task will run on which processor and then how or what time will it run	dev
audio_0_60323.wav	so there is a point five probability it is one, and point five probability it is zero when the data is totally random	dev
audio_0_226848.wav	8 millimetres	dev
audio_0_163098.wav	In a similar way, the half power beam width can be shown to be that beam width 3 dB in the x y plane that will be 2	dev
audio_0_33100.wav	So, you are saving on computational time, but you have to do a little bit more work to calculate Amn the matrix elements right and you get the answer right	dev
audio_0_187507.wav	Very similar to the positive predictive value and you can use the formula that I shown before to use this	dev
audio_0_172042.wav	So, this will make sure that the current which is flowing from the source would be in the same direction as if it was there even the original circuit was energized	dev
audio_0_223481.wav	So, these are 4 proteins, it forms our DNA, they are abbreviated as A, T, G, C	dev
audio_0_57724.wav	now delays is coming to thirty here and thirty three	dev
audio_0_193125.wav	So, it is an irreducible factorization, it is a factorization into product of smaller degree polynomials, hence f is not irreducible in Z X that means, f is reducible in Z X	dev
audio_0_223591.wav	So, if there are zero inversions, then you have exactly similar in your taste to your friend and the rankings are identical	dev
audio_0_218389.wav	and if you look at the ah, let us say currents: input current, input current and output current	dev
audio_0_178064.wav	So, outage basically means that the path loss it your actually seeing is greater than path loss max and you have designed path loss max for your scenario as PL bar what is the probability of outage Gaussian distribution what is the probability of power voltage	dev
audio_0_176365.wav	That also is a analysis activity	dev
audio_0_6772.wav	So, these laws are known as Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law; that is, KCL and KVL and before that Ohm’s law	dev
audio_0_152089.wav	Now, the data is publicly available please feel free to actually play around with the data	dev

audio_0_238918.wav	The first is managing the business, which is effective management is managing performance, and is the responsibility of all managers	dev
audio_0_190883.wav	If not, choose x n plus 1 inside I minus in I n, I n is certainly contained in remember each of these is contained in I	dev
audio_0_67874.wav	What it matters is how you target the problem that is the most critically important things and in a modern day if you really want to make a difference and you have to have a proper paradigm to do achieve this how you are going to do it in terms of paradigm this is what I am talking about that who will come first what will be their paradigm this paradigm has to be defined one second you need a defined protocol so that everybody can follow then you have to have a defined medium, then you have to have a defined surface	dev
audio_0_36461.wav	Our product will be different	dev
audio_0_116400.wav	so, ah, with this we will conclude today	dev
audio_0_30500.wav	In other courses, you may have seen that if it is a two dimensional integration; you will be putting a double integral and you will be putting a triple integral, but we find that from the context it is clear whether it is a single integral double or triple integral because of the differential element ok	dev
audio_0_203229.wav	In that way, we will in that way we will construct points P1, P2, P3 in the bottom view also	dev
audio_0_57707.wav	ok, so these inputs which are coming after cloning, they have to be driven	dev
audio_0_239265.wav	Accept, what they say, incorporate, what they say, in your decisions, treat all employees consistently	dev

audio_0_149004.wav	Some users actually reacted with their, gave the reasons, why they are actually changing their names, usernames and actually explain things	dev
audio_0_179961.wav	Now, in this context I believe we also may be let me just mention receiver sensitivity for most of the systems that we are looking at is typically of the order of minus 100 dBm typically of the order of minus 100 dBm, how much that will be in dBW	dev
audio_0_226616.wav	That is most of the value would be close to 30 degree centigrade	dev
audio_0_175181.wav	And for completion one Spiritual Domain is obviously quite controversial and each one will have their own way of looking at it	dev
audio_0_80837.wav	So, now, I know; what is my critical frequency I can calculate critical frequency using this particular formula	dev
audio_0_186083.wav	So, what you are saying here is access those rows where the element in the vector 1 is not equal to 3 and we need to access all the columns	dev
audio_0_62476.wav	so we start our discussion on the placement problem in this lecture	dev
audio_0_226775.wav	So, now, I know if I have got this voltage, so, I correspondingly try to get the forces on it and interestingly I also try to make it dynamic	dev
audio_0_151819.wav	How do whisper users interact in an anonymous environment, how is the interactions on whisper	dev
audio_0_210175.wav	So, in the next class, we will learn about solid works and practice couple of examples how to use that tool	dev
audio_0_195651.wav	And also if I plot the ID versus VGS, assuming saturation region in this case, which means that VDS is assumed to be large enough	dev
audio_0_148998.wav	So, let us go overall the analysis that you have seen until now, it basically says that 20 percent of the users change five times, that there are people who have changed 113 times and there is weak relationship between popularity and the number of post somebody posts for the username changes that is what we learnt until now	dev
audio_0_215769.wav	so you will read only here	dev
audio_0_223639.wav	So, this has to be done after we are solve the recursively, so this is basically the combinations step, how many elements in the right are bigger than elements in the left	dev
audio_0_174506.wav	So your assessment should include something which is beyond the predetermined content	dev
audio_0_3790.wav	So, that is actually minus 40 e to the power minus 2 t that is why this minus sign is here	dev
audio_0_135812.wav	Now, this Gramscian understanding of the term subaltern was taken up by the influential group of South Asian historians who formed the Subaltern Studies Collective in the 1980’s	dev
audio_0_159232.wav	So now let us try to see how to do this 2NF normalization	dev
audio_0_184159.wav	But invoking the property of linearity or from signal processing, we can say that I can move the summation to the right hand side basically I without since it is a linear operation	dev
audio_0_9472.wav	So, multiplied by 10 to the power minus 3 so, that is why here it is multi into dt	dev
audio_0_12203.wav	Now, in this case 5 to 8 percent of the rated is required to allow that your full load current or your rated current	dev

audio_0_176197.wav	That means what we thought we knew, we did not know	dev
audio_0_1057.wav	So, basically it will be P G minus the rotor copper loss right	dev
audio_0_62643.wav	so we continued our discussion in week five where we talked about how to design the clock networks, various clock routing architectures like h tree, x tree, method of means and medians, etcetera, and we looked at the various methods of clock tree design and the kind of hybrid approaches that are followed to minimize the clocks skew	dev
audio_0_88178.wav	Now in order to appreciate these vulnerabilities and how attackers have been able to utilise these vulnerabilities to create exploits and malware	dev
audio_0_152911.wav	Another aspect of finger is related with the impatient or nervous drumming with the help of our fingers	dev

audio_0_195281.wav	Now if it is not equal to I0, we know that the circuit won't reach steady state because this voltage will go on increasing or decreasing	dev
audio_0_4257.wav	So, this one this one is symmetrical if it is 0, if it is T by 2, it is T	dev
audio_0_121298.wav	So, Mirthus said, The tyrants have captured Nawab Sahib	dev
audio_0_102350.wav	So, you just read them from top to bottom and read this list from left to right and correspond to them	dev
audio_0_49861.wav	so this r one j this is next term is divided by r two j	dev
audio_0_218408.wav	so here is where you should very careful	dev
audio_0_1400.wav	So, this is generator, or motor where your what you call magnetic structure and this is the shaft, this is I have taken from a book just for the sake of your to completeness of this brief discussion right and this is the main frame	dev
audio_0_84855.wav	We see input; we see output	dev
audio_0_153138.wav	For example, if you look at this particular photograph which is there on the right hand top corner	dev
audio_0_31027.wav	So, W m is not a node it is the function defined on the segment on the mth segment right	dev
audio_0_165844.wav	And have the turns ratio N 1, N turns number of turns in primary coil as N 1	dev
audio_0_42913.wav	So, if I asked you to simply this what how would you write down real part of a complex number	dev
audio_0_181445.wav	So, here is how GSM has handled it	dev
audio_0_175783.wav	What should I try next	dev
audio_0_152187.wav	And to confirm, to get ground truth when this pictures are just the same data sometimes if the techniques that are machine learning techniques are not going to be fool proof and they are not going to make 100 percent right prediction	dev
audio_0_113012.wav	Now, VSWR is measured by this VSWR meter, you can see whatever I said that VSWR meter front panel	dev
audio_0_29493.wav	Right because then it the intent brings in whether it has to be dealt with mental health system or legal system	dev
audio_0_175521.wav	What happens is, knowing the underlying science or physical phenomena or chemical phenomena or biological phenomena it does not automatically lead to design concepts	dev
audio_0_214907.wav	so contending protocols, rich wireless protocols for the ah internet of things, well, definitely involve the ah	dev
audio_0_116632.wav	so i can say that if it is, say that spatial ah web services for a particular organization, may particular state, may be particular district, can be instantiated on the things right	dev
audio_0_156687.wav	Nothing can be lost there	dev
audio_0_142337.wav	Better we write as in flow or outflow	dev
audio_0_31967.wav	So, this is all fine, this is how Maxwell and company had written it in terms of real valued physical quantities ok	dev
audio_0_28119.wav	But actually this happens only when we update the name inside the function	dev
audio_0_71603.wav	Till then everything was fine but during integration it was found that most of the functionalities are not working	dev
audio_0_185021.wav	In fact, for most of the channels that we encounter it is still an open problem, very difficult problem	dev
audio_0_91765.wav	So, that is the value here for this divided difference having these three points	dev
audio_0_43226.wav	So, this is the best example, I have an integration from minus a to b some function which is blowing up	dev
audio_0_202019.wav	And we will once we click ok, the explode view completes	dev
audio_0_56124.wav	like this, let say now means on the surface of the silicon, when you run a set of lines on the same layer, let say they are running in parallel, then you have to satisfy certain criteria	dev
audio_0_30985.wav	And you want to find out how does the potential vary as I go from go through the capacitor, that is that is one something that you might want to calculate right	dev
audio_0_190465.wav	More interestingly, if you take the product of any arbitrary elements, you get a c minus b d plus i times a d plus b c	dev
audio_0_178810.wav	In Molisch, we have the general result if I have M antennas expected value of E gamma EGC is given by gamma into 1 plus M minus 1 pi by 4	dev
audio_0_8768.wav	So, this is actually squirrel cage motor	dev
audio_0_132841.wav	so then what is the additional energy stored	dev
audio_0_75539.wav	So, consistent with these observations what has been found is in most of the cancer cells So, there was a study which compared the expression of these proteins	dev
audio_0_103522.wav	In this context, if I define if I instantiate an object B, then I would certainly have a layout for this, which would look like this is what we have discussed already	dev
audio_0_188960.wav	If it is f 1, if it is very severe then you stop the pump and then x it	dev
audio_0_140789.wav	So they are, so such things happen and you have, for example in a motor, in a motor suppose you want to control position	dev
audio_0_19323.wav	Direct labour, again same, 28, 56, so it has doubled, it's a variable cost	dev
audio_0_215189.wav	if you have a change in magnetic field, obviously you need to look at magnets	dev
audio_0_48677.wav	j plus e z zero k there's last term here is nothing but e vector zero	dev
audio_0_68407.wav	what will you observe	dev
audio_0_236589.wav	There is actually a paper on it	dev
audio_0_7782.wav	Now if you consider one at a time at the input and output responses you are getting and sum it up if it is equal to that same as your sum of the inputs where together you are putting at the input and getting the output response	dev
audio_0_130748.wav	thank you very much and we will see you in the next class	dev
audio_0_143761.wav	The shares outstanding at the end of year in terms of millions is given	dev

audio_0_189363.wav	In this lecture we are going to look at a case study and a problem statement associated with it	dev
audio_0_163761.wav	Because the reason is that low frequencies atmospheric noise is dominates; that means, the whole ah radio deception that is limited by this atmospheric noise	dev
audio_0_64907.wav	the two blocks which are more strongly connected together, we try to put them as close together as possible, but if they are not so close strongly connected, they maybe put a little for the effort, no problem	dev
audio_0_65056.wav	ok, so the clock routing solution is actually the set of wire segments that will allow us to make this connection	dev
audio_0_62525.wav	wire length does not always necessary mean that your total area of routing	dev
audio_0_57820.wav	we are using straight implementation like this: a or b, c, a, b or c, that is, you are using and in the first level or in the second level	dev
audio_0_104420.wav	The only difference is I need to explicitly maintain the type and the relationship between the type and the particular object that I am using	dev
audio_0_154484.wav	Most people in France embrace and kiss twice particularly in semi formal situations and it is not considered to be awkward by them	dev
audio_0_205461.wav	So, now I can remove this part and remove this part and retain this part, try to visualize how it looks like	dev
audio_0_84196.wav	yYou can apply sine wave or square wave or ramp or pulse or arbitrary signal or noise to a circuit using this function generator, right	dev
audio_0_43303.wav	Above	dev
audio_0_103320.wav	Then I simply to draw I simply write a for loop, but I start from the zero, this code must be familiar with you this basically tries to find out how many elements are there in the array of shapes and you go over them	dev
audio_0_5368.wav	So, this is your 73	dev
audio_0_132950.wav	Similarly, if you hold the accelerometer in this direction, then the Z value will be minimum here, and the Z value will be maximum here	dev
audio_0_213629.wav	ah, working between the r f i d reader and the tag tags are all read right	dev
audio_0_12895.wav	So, v c 0 plus is nothing but the v c 0 minus, because at the time of switching the voltage cannot be change instantaneously across the capacitor right	dev
audio_0_60937.wav	so if you move the elements simultaneously in some way in both the dimensions, this is called two d compaction, which in general can result in better layouts, better compaction	dev
audio_0_175428.wav	Module 2 presents through 20 units of Instructional System Design of an engineering course in the framework provided by NBA	dev

audio_0_213402.wav	so we have used i a r work bench, ah for all the code development	dev
audio_0_70710.wav	So this is the procedure to do	dev
audio_0_81611.wav	So, if you see the screen once again, right	dev
audio_0_97342.wav	But it is understanding of or interpretation of this variable i as to whether it is const; if it is const then you are saying that this cannot be changed; if it is not const this can be changed	dev
audio_0_34959.wav	So, we looked at analysis, we looked at accuracy and in accuracy we looked at for example, dispersion numerical	dev
audio_0_142545.wav	And the energy policy which was declared in May 2001 was very much in favour of energy sector, particularly favouring Enron	dev
audio_0_192443.wav	So, multiplicative inverse means just in the group sense	dev
audio_0_223502.wav	So, turning the arguments backward, it says that therefore if a 0 equal to b 0, it is very safe to assume that a 0, b 0 forms part the solution and proceed to the rest of the problem	dev
audio_0_203393.wav	It draws a line if you are moving mouse you would not see any more information	dev

audio_0_170068.wav	What is free body diagram	dev
audio_0_140788.wav	So there will be heat transfer and heat will come from the reactor to the jacket and therefore the temperature will fill fall, so there are basically two different mechanisms, one is from flow to establishment of temperature in the jacket and from jacket to affecting the, that is from the jacket between the jacket and the reactor heat transfer mechanism	dev
audio_0_166703.wav	So now in this particular case the dots are already placed	dev
audio_0_219260.wav	So, at a later stage if you go to w, we know that we will take at least that much time to reach w	dev
audio_0_130773.wav	they are almost like rankine cycle	dev
audio_0_193687.wav	Gcd of 4 and 6 will be 2, gcd of 3 and let us say 12 is 3, gcd of 6 and 8 will be 2 and so on, ok	dev
audio_0_92818.wav	So this value does not depend on path, but in general, we will see also later that these line integral depends on the path	dev
audio_0_239994.wav	The challenges again are, social pressures	dev
audio_0_93236.wav	we are, most of us, good speakers, but when it comes to writing, when it comes to checking our correctness, we feel that, in the deluce of grammatical rules, we often criss cross	dev
audio_0_134830.wav	Recency effect also a function of the central executive	dev
audio_0_202270.wav	So, this object always be I can really move anywhere, but it always be tangent to that surface	dev
audio_0_7852.wav	This means we replace every voltage source by 0 volt; that means, your short circuit that voltage source should be short circuit, and every current source by 0 ampere that is it is an open circuit right	dev
audio_0_142246.wav	Or you can say minus in bank and minus in reserves	dev
audio_0_162698.wav	Now, what is it pi a square means what	dev
audio_0_82906.wav	So, output voltage would be 0 volt when inputs are grounded, right is what we think	dev
audio_0_95281.wav	in such a situation, sometimes you know you get a letter where a person is talking about, where a person wants you to invite for a particular lecture, but at the same time he also talks about some other things	dev
audio_0_117365.wav	i need to fit this requirement to some provider or a set of provider and such as the customer that see, this is the provider, is there for the provider in	dev

audio_0_180281.wav	We do not derive this, probability of error of DBPSK in AWGN channels will be half e power minus gamma and given that you have these types of expressions for the probability of bit error rate, then we said that we can derive the probability of error of these modulation methods; for example, BPSK in fading by using the fading distribution	dev
audio_0_197146.wav	In the drain feedback case, the way we started off it was connected to ground but here it is not	dev
audio_0_61155.wav	from circuits you may find that you need one thousand test vectors	dev
audio_0_99332.wav	But if I have a friend stepping in then I will probably not keep him waiting in the drawing room rather I will take him to my inner rooms my bed room or kitchen and so on	dev
audio_0_18280.wav	Therefore this is that your what you call this is the charge on 20 and your this is actually there will be an is right this is the charge and 20 micro farad and 30 micro farad capacitor, because they are in series with the 300 volt source therefore, we know q is equal to cv from the formula	dev
audio_0_41078.wav	So, what would be the unknowns	dev
audio_0_61318.wav	so the implication is that you one false paths to be identified and you do not want unnecessary manipulation or computation of false paths that are produced by static delay analysis, like static timing analyzer, where the delay model is the worst case delay model	dev
audio_0_101985.wav	In the static area is a global static object	dev
audio_0_76331.wav	So, in the last lecture we had concluded our discussion on rheological behaviour of ECM networks taking the example of collagen and we discussed that one of the main properties of these networks is this property of strength stiffening or the network becoming stiff if you exert force on it	dev
audio_0_42498.wav	So, what if I add k naught squared E on both sides	dev
audio_0_2365.wav	So, I2 we got 20 ampere and N2 / N1 is 1 /10	dev
audio_0_61879.wav	it now suppose the aggressor changes the voltage by an amount delta v aggressor	dev
audio_0_59142.wav	like, the convention is that wherever ah, poly silicon and a diffusion line cross, there is one cross here and there is another cross here, so a transistor is formed	dev

audio_0_154304.wav	Let me tell you what my experiences with the head tilt are; I was looking for an alternative for the listeners nod, using it perpetually makes one look like a bobble head and after approximately one year of head tilting and noticed mainly two reactions	dev
audio_0_78691.wav	So, by doing this and choosing multiple different constructs you can determine the folding signature of multiple domains one thing I introduced in the last class, briefly spoke about is rate dependent stability	dev
audio_0_161885.wav	So, the timestamp, when somebody talks about the timestamp of the transaction, that is essentially the timestamp of the validation phase of the transaction, so which is essentially equal to the validation timestamp	dev
audio_0_187058.wav	There are other ways of performing this test	dev
audio_0_42661.wav	Primed	dev
audio_0_229318.wav	And number 2 to know that how large the spread is	dev
audio_0_8359.wav	5 into 10 to the power minus 6 farad, so half C v square simplify you will get 4 t square micro joule your this is your it will be less your less than less than less than some where equal to it has gone right	dev
audio_0_162396.wav	So, that is the gauss condition	dev
audio_0_38976.wav	So, before coming to this let us just summarize over here	dev
audio_0_198715.wav	Now what is the current mirror bias	dev
audio_0_32413.wav	b n and t n I will choose something simple I can choose pulse basis function also, if I am very lazy I can choose pulse basis function	dev
audio_0_143831.wav	Either it can be expressed as a percent or just as a fraction	dev
audio_0_51101.wav	so b induced is of the order of l over tau c square	dev
audio_0_159160.wav	So is project ID	dev
audio_0_124450.wav	ok, i need a circuit that amplifier is very small difference and ignores the fact that each of these voltages large, ok, that is, its emphasizes the difference	dev
audio_0_202544.wav	For example, let us consider this dimension is 25 mm, this one 25 mm is correct fit	dev
audio_0_187770.wav	So, I want to penalize these coefficients	dev
audio_0_93580.wav	but again, that requires so many qualities	dev
audio_0_159182.wav	So if project name affects this ID unnecessarily, it doesn't make sense	dev
audio_0_84672.wav	720 into 4	dev
audio_0_59698.wav	this is smaller	dev
audio_0_37823.wav	So, as we will see later on in the course, these kinds of equations the once in vacuum are simpler to solve then these kinds of equations where epsilon is the function of space	dev
audio_0_163494.wav	So, this is the array axis two element array this is my observation thing	dev
audio_0_56895.wav	when i am doing the numbering, i can always keep track of whether the number zero that i am using is the first zero or or the second zero in the sequence	dev
audio_0_143777.wav	Why it is high compared to that in TCS	dev
audio_0_40680.wav	So, we will just assume that this is LTI ok, Linear Time Invariance system	dev
audio_0_229015.wav	If points are out of control during the initial phase that is during the initial estimation only, the assignable cause should be determine and the sample should be removed from the at estimation that we have been doing	dev
audio_0_183855.wav	So, the number of codes then becomes very very limited right	dev
audio_0_41112.wav	What happens in region 1, that epsilon r will be for vacuum and current will be there	dev
audio_0_176819.wav	So classification there are IT consultants HR consultants and management consultants like strategy consulting, organization consulting and change consulting	dev
audio_0_64491.wav	for that you will again have to do some kind of similar functional behaviour analysis and you will have to find out the test vectors	dev
audio_0_226017.wav	So, angular pitch is nothing, but which covers from the imaginary down point of this extended thread to the topmost point is called as the angular pitch	dev
audio_0_20528.wav	So, for a given sales mix, which we calculate this period	dev
audio_0_28471.wav	If you do not specify a sort function, there might be an implicit function that the sort function uses; otherwise it will use the comparison function that you provide	dev
audio_0_219234.wav	Depth first search will pick the first neighbor, and then explore it further	dev
audio_0_74174.wav	So, PEG being inert cells cannot form adhesions; however, there was one important difference	dev
audio_0_100797.wav	It is a special constructor which takes an object and makes a copy of it	dev
audio_0_118625.wav	so if you do a integration, so if you do it, it approximately count as ten thousand, one zero, so much right	dev
audio_0_30780.wav	So, it is in gamma one is in this direction	dev
audio_0_121610.wav	So, cunning here denotes craftiness manipulation, whereas the word that she probably wants to use is cleverness	dev
audio_0_6305.wav	Now, if you apply a voltage source here right so, voltage 1 voltage source suppose V 0 is given right and, this voltage source this voltage source V 0 is given; that means, at this point this voltage source is V 0 actually is equal to 1 volt, because your what you call, because low electrical elements connect here	dev
audio_0_143380.wav	We have a surplus cash	dev
audio_0_101404.wav	The only difference being or the significant difference being that the global variables exist in the global scope, but static data members are within the scope of the class in which the static data member belongs	dev
audio_0_195175.wav	And you have to choose them appropriately so that the transistor is maintained in saturation	dev
audio_0_174962.wav	But to appreciate that compare Anderson Bloom Taxonomy with another taxonomy of your selection/choice	dev
audio_0_225159.wav	And now, the first thing we have to convince ourselves is that the heap that we local heap property that we just fixed does not need any further fixing	dev
audio_0_6465.wav	So, capacitor inductors also passive elements because, they of their own they cannot generate energy you can store their energy in capacitor, or inductor you can retrieve also; that means, other way sometimes we tell that they have memory like because they can store energy right	dev
audio_0_226085.wav	So, the motor rotates, right this is this is a motor this motor rotates and this is the screw and on top of it if you have a table which is attached	dev
audio_0_116262.wav	migration of intensive ah uh ah come component, like which are ah computational intensive component need to be migrated	dev
audio_0_81454.wav	So, these are the set of things in today's series, we will again divide these into 2 or 3 different modules so that it does not become too boring	dev
audio_0_188004.wav	At 95 percent confidence level, that is, at alpha equal to 5 percent	dev
audio_0_95032.wav	so prepare thoroughly, prepare your presentation thoroughly, but with preparation, practice it practices repeatedly	dev
audio_0_121508.wav	So, the father says that he has almost ended all friendship with her	dev
audio_0_153830.wav	In the context of computer mediated communication, the temporal dynamics remain important	dev
audio_0_159560.wav	However, if one thinks from the point of view of S, then the same thing can be done and the estimate that one gets is n s times nr by vr by A	dev
audio_0_166634.wav	So let us start our discussion about the topic	dev
audio_0_181424.wav	And to make sure that this can never happen we introduced a filter which is a band pass filter which basically will eliminate all of the; after 915 megahertz up to 915 megahertz is stop band and beyond 935 is pass band	dev
audio_0_186384.wav	R, to set the working directory from the GUI, you need to click on this 3 dots button	dev
audio_0_65123.wav	so if you can handle the local skew and try to reduce them, that will perhaps [vocalize noise] provide us with a solution where we can run a circuit with a very high clock frequency	dev
audio_0_133081.wav	Because we are succinctly going through these approach is therefore, we would not go through now all the 16 traits that he talks about and looking at the description	dev
audio_0_30983.wav	What about the potential at the at this point	dev
audio_0_77974.wav	Hello and welcome to our todays lecture of NPTEL course Introduction to Mechanobiology	dev
audio_0_176475.wav	That means here look at the various parts which is strictly like analysis process	dev
audio_0_36692.wav	So, the n comes to the middle alright	dev
audio_0_84633.wav	So, given Rf equals to 100 kilo ohm which is given here, R1 is 10 kilo ohm, Av or V gain is 1 plus Rf by Rin	dev
audio_0_65109.wav	so if you are able to do that, you will get something which is referred to as zero skew tree	dev
audio_0_34179.wav	So, can you guess in 3D what will happen	dev
audio_0_221476.wav	So, above it, because no paths can come through this, this direction, the number of paths coming here is only 6 coming from the left	dev
audio_0_173132.wav	You cannot design engineering problems to pay attention to all these criteria that fits into a half an hour type of activity	dev
audio_0_35291.wav	Then use those basis functions to simplify your expand your integral equation and convert it into a discrete set of equations which finally, gave you a linear system of equations and we solved it	dev
audio_0_225740.wav	This is an eight week course	dev
audio_0_178347.wav	This is the definition of the coherence time	dev
audio_0_206610.wav	The remaining dimensions we can get it from the other views	dev
audio_0_221959.wav	So, each intermediate value of the matrix could require looking at n intermediate, each value each position could require looking at n intermediate value	dev
audio_0_202149.wav	Go to front plane	dev
audio_0_165369.wav	Then M1 and B1 these are the two elements which are under the influence of the x1 displacement	dev
audio_0_116320.wav	some can be offloaded	dev
audio_0_18868.wav	So, that mean, if you take the parallel of ah equivalent of this, this circuit will be your this is 40 plus 60 into 6 divided by 60 plus 6, right	dev
audio_0_233694.wav	How do you select, training methods	dev
audio_0_5222.wav	And the answer is given 284 angle 150 degree volt answer is correct you try to find out very simple problem, but very interesting problem , right	dev
audio_0_147093.wav	Now, this tutorial will guide you to how to prepare your system for collecting the data from social networks	dev
audio_0_182316.wav	Again at this point we are talking about spread spectrum systems	dev
audio_0_85390.wav	So, once this is done for all the cache sets what good result at the end of this for loop is that the entire cache is filled with spy data	dev
audio_0_11550.wav	So, in this case what happened, the system is balanced and it is sufficient to consider single phase right	dev
audio_0_195214.wav	Here we need to find I0 minus ID	dev
audio_0_220925.wav	So, you do n such extraction	dev
audio_0_43187.wav	Basically using this idea finite differences right; so, this as the word almost gives it away, this is going to be in time domain and differential form ok	dev
audio_0_44776.wav	It has reached steady state earlier than in the earlier case when the capacitance was 1,000 microarrats	dev
audio_0_207470.wav	There is something like scissors	dev
audio_0_228299.wav	So, we go to this construction you go to the construction and try to see the distance from the plane	dev
audio_0_43038.wav	So, that sort of brings to a close the idea of PML theory as I said in the very beginning you could have done this in 2 ways one is to stay within the realm of physics have two different materials one normal material one anisotropic absorb it gives you the same results	dev
audio_0_82960.wav	So, let us see the circuit, now you can see the screen again, right	dev
audio_0_7763.wav	So, circuit shown in figure 28 is called the current divider	dev
audio_0_223452.wav	So, we initially assume that the maximum common subword of length 0	dev
audio_0_190796.wav	For example, we have to show that 0 is there, but that is OK, because 0 is in I n of course, for every n so 0 is there	dev
audio_0_202135.wav	And what we would like to have is close the object something like some 50 mm, maybe something like 70 mm, click ok	dev
audio_0_102656.wav	So, you can see C style cast can allows you almost anything and everything, and therefore, you run a major risk if you use the C style casting	dev
audio_0_190828.wav	Similarly, a 2 is in I n 2 and so on	dev
audio_0_29669.wav	Whereas those into practice they endorse that you know, there is a disorder element here	dev
audio_0_12865.wav	So, it it will become your 8 second right, this will be tau, because switch has moved from this to that	dev
audio_0_166052.wav	So it means that if you see this particular figure, the branches are separate and no any branch is cutting any other branch	dev
audio_0_35143.wav	So, this theorem holds to here also, whatever surfaces are bounding the volume	dev
audio_0_103986.wav	In this module we have understood access specifiers how they help to control visibility of the class members, the public, and the private	dev
audio_0_135699.wav	And by the time we reach this scene we know that these are all part of the festivities that are associated with the harvesting of the yam	dev
audio_0_40577.wav	So, one exercise which you should do is go back and try to use the 6th shape functions and derive this	dev
audio_0_240010.wav	How do you find out, who is capable, or how people are going to react, or what they might need sitting in a safe	dev
audio_0_135549.wav	But though there are these stories of alliances, the overwhelming African response to this European colonisation was of military resistance	dev
audio_0_80338.wav	Now, why we are kind of repeating this thing	dev
audio_0_72012.wav	Two major reasons why the project fails is that the development team doesn't understand the customer's requirements	dev
audio_0_205016.wav	In today's class we will learn more about triangles for example, a set square if it is reoriented with horizontal planes and vertical planes, how do they really look like	dev
audio_0_120181.wav	So, the other social realistic part that we derive from this extract is the idea that the entire neighborhood is getting ruined by this pleasure that they derive from the game of the chess	dev
audio_0_35002.wav	So, I have to design this material which basically absorbs the wave and again it send it back so, no numerical reflection ok	dev
audio_0_19665.wav	So, if you compute number of units, you will get 1,000, 10,000 because selling price is known to you, total sales is known to you	dev
audio_0_231164.wav	For example, you see the methods of measurement weight	dev
audio_0_65008.wav	for vdd, y coordinate is two, zero come two	dev
audio_0_28368.wav	In this case how many will memoization do	dev
audio_0_43819.wav	So, I have to solve and find out the current first then repeat these; so, that is the step 0 added over here, and that is where computational EM helps us ok	dev
audio_0_143111.wav	Now go to asset side	dev
audio_0_58084.wav	you complement it to dash	dev
audio_0_104053.wav	So, together it is a multilevel inheritance red rose is a rose, is a flower	dev
audio_0_147808.wav	You can use various other filters in similar fashion	dev
audio_0_154551.wav	Amongst women it is considered to be a feminine and positive posture; this is a posture which women in the grooming classes are taught to opt for	dev
audio_0_81357.wav	So, it is working well for 50 hertz	dev
audio_0_104621.wav	And therefore, it can always say that whether that true dynamic type matches the static type into which you are trying to bring that address	dev
audio_0_104582.wav	So, I am doing a dynamic cast from of p A in this direction; it was of A type and now I am trying to take it to B star	dev
audio_0_95014.wav	so you need to understand that you are not between the aids and are the people i mean the members, the audience members	dev
audio_0_100001.wav	These are two different kinds of structure types	dev
audio_0_219053.wav	So, it is like the traveling salesmen, we are looking for the shortest tour, so it say is there a tour of less than or equal to said me cost, so is there a vertex cover less then equal to a certain cost	dev
audio_0_191751.wav	So, what we have is f can be written uniquely as a product of a rational number and a primitive polynomial	dev
audio_0_121472.wav	Rebuking means to speak angry to someone because you disapprove of what they have said or done	dev
audio_0_25277.wav	So that’s the relationship between what you see on the x axis, x axis here at the bottom and at your left is the y axis where you are tracking on time performance of the student	dev
audio_0_182445.wav	So, we can have, but the key thing is you must have waveforms that are orthogonal and the uses have to be synchronous	dev
audio_0_100398.wav	We will now next continue and talk about the other side of the function mechanisms	dev
audio_0_70128.wav	And which is further stamped an endorsed by specific government dignitaries or government individuals who have been appointed by the local authorities or by your institute or something	dev
audio_0_35098.wav	Fourier series right, so if I have some I can write down my basis function as like this	dev
audio_0_36830.wav	So, one transmitter object over here and let us say another receiver over here right	dev
audio_0_23073.wav	and many times we arrogantly communicate without paying respect to others feelings, so that also creates conflict	dev
audio_0_139174.wav	So the first one is configuration one, let us see that, so you see in ratio control we have two streams, the first one, we can recall the wild stream	dev
audio_0_188561.wav	So, again here, if you see I have fitted values from the bonds model and I am plotting for the y parameter, I am plotting the standardized residuals	dev
audio_0_158557.wav	So an expression of the evaluation plan may be the following	dev
audio_0_188812.wav	If this constraint is active; that means, 2 x 1 plus 5 x 2 minus 10 equals 0 and if this constraint is active; that means, x 1 equals 1	dev
audio_0_85662.wav	In fact the attacks have further reduced the number of false injected from 16 faults as we have seen over here to just a single fault	dev
audio_0_58002.wav	this hierarchical approach is an interesting approach which also is quite commonly used	dev
audio_0_120785.wav	And so we do get a brief sketch of this female character called Kusuma	dev
audio_0_19140.wav	So, contribution per number of units will give you total contribution for July and for August separately	dev
audio_0_222231.wav	So, the instinctive thing would be to say g A plus g B	dev
audio_0_186443.wav	So, an example of that would be the K nearest neighbour that we saw before	dev
audio_0_59194.wav	what will be the thickness, t of the wire, width, w and the aspect ratio also	dev
audio_0_23654.wav	So you are saying you do not write very often, but when you have some kind of thoughts	dev
audio_0_191872.wav	By definition a primitive polynomial has leading coefficient positive	dev
audio_0_164465.wav	So eventually if you have four different nodes it is nothing but you are talking about one single node, because you can join then without any change in the circuit configuration	dev
audio_0_229853.wav	So, if you want to talk little bit more about control of processes and automation let me make a schematic diagram	dev
audio_0_24925.wav	If, you ask somebody to think about, you know somebody in, say, if I am in India and I say, do not think about other people as people other than, in India, but think about it from their perspective, from say people in Italy, For example, people find it a bit difficult, they assume things that are valid here are valid even in Italy and so, they may make some design mistakes, design thinking mistakes	dev
audio_0_184719.wav	So, what does it say	dev
audio_0_104877.wav	We want to say that this is a pointer type	dev
audio_0_69734.wav	So, we will come later into that	dev
audio_0_94445.wav	the body language should never be ah negative	dev
audio_0_14900.wav	5 Henry right and and you take the derivative of the current i t di t upon dt	dev
audio_0_35292.wav	So, this you can ask lots of questions how do we know what n to choose that would be the first question right	dev
audio_0_19919.wav	So, for optimist calculation it is into 1	dev
audio_0_145349.wav	The operating system should not change a programmer assigned priority	dev
audio_0_161404.wav	The B plus tree can be used to the formula that is there	dev
audio_0_201692.wav	We will be in a position to see this horizontal line, this horizontal line, this vertical also we will be in a position to see and this one	dev
audio_0_92538.wav	Why it is called in the mean square sense	dev
audio_0_223690.wav	Now, here we are doing it an n log n which is potentially much smaller than the number of inversion you want to get	dev
audio_0_178806.wav	All of them have the same magnitude, but different phases just to do the co phasing	dev
audio_0_2335.wav	5 kilovolt right	dev
audio_0_75105.wav	So, this brings us to the question that what is driving this behavior of strain stiffening and what it turns out is as I was drawing before when you have increase in strain then individual fibers tend to align along the direction of strain	dev
audio_0_226130.wav	Then, the next topic of discussion is going to be measurements of screw thread elements	dev
audio_0_220593.wav	Now, in some situations it is useful to realize that the graph that we have looks like this; that there are no crossing edges	dev
audio_0_102139.wav	So I illustrate that in this slide, again I have base 1, base 2, the derived class derives from the same base classes	dev
audio_0_221193.wav	We saw that the Bellman Ford algorithm allows us to generalize Dijsktra's algorithm and compute single source shortest paths in weighted graphs with negative weight, but without negative cycles	dev
audio_0_50773.wav	that, if i will come out	dev
audio_0_23120.wav	many student criticize others, like, say, for somebody is having a different dress patterns, which is seems to be very unusual, somebody is having a different kind of haircut	dev
audio_0_163356.wav	So, what it says that you evaluate the integral on those stationary points	dev
audio_0_27310.wav	Finally, we can close the handle when we have done and in between that we can flush the buffer by using flush command and we also saw that there are some string operations to strip white space and this can be useful to remove these trailing backslash n which come whenever you are processing text files	dev
audio_0_103376.wav	In the next module, we will take up more examples to show how these tools can be used to actually do certain design and code processing on the class hierarchy	dev
audio_0_226482.wav	Now, this describe the situations when the number of occurrence is and of a particular outcome during N independent tests with the probability of any outcome P is same	dev
audio_0_156447.wav	Now what does that mean is that, suppose there is the course is this database, so that means that if there is a course database which is the, and if there is a teacher, let us say A	dev
audio_0_208412.wav	So, having many more points, we will be going to have a very smooth curve there	dev
audio_0_20446.wav	If you take our example of operating a taxi service, we have one car, we are operating a taxi service, what will be the variable cost	dev
audio_0_231104.wav	For example, when you try to go to a doctor and if you want to do a measurement for your blood pressure, the general advice is you have to go to the doctor, lie down, take rest or relaxation for 5 to 10 minutes and then start taking measurement	dev
audio_0_94877.wav	so for that you need to look at the people	dev
audio_0_92349.wav	And then, we call that this T is the period of the function and the function is periodic if this property holds for all t	dev
audio_0_152251.wav	The study was done in the US and therefore if you were to repeat this study and find out Adhaar number or others details of Indian Citizens it will be actually interesting to look at that	dev
audio_0_230591.wav	The pressure drop is the function of speed squared; hence, a mean steady reading represents a mean value of the speed squared while the average flow depends on the mean speed not squared	dev
audio_0_220403.wav	So, we might be tempted to just say, so uv is the smallest one, pick any edge in my given tree T prime given tree T which goes from inside to outside, then replace	dev
audio_0_41671.wav	If these integrals exist trivially then there is no problem I can go back to my original procedure evaluate the integral over all segments get my system of equations and I am there	dev
audio_0_82887.wav	So, is the output voltage is not 0, how we can make it 0, right	dev
audio_0_185265.wav	So, the mathematical expressions can be nicely understood if you were to visualize it as one quadrant of a circle this corresponds to Doppler fd; the full length the radius of the, and then you are going to take at different angles	dev
audio_0_79867.wav	So, the and tthe difference between frequencies ast minus 3dB point will determine	dev
audio_0_23078.wav	when any kind of change takes place, it creates stress, disturbances, discomfort, is not it	dev
audio_0_235464.wav	So, prior history of promotions, will contribute to this	dev
audio_0_228417.wav	We will meet you again next time	dev
audio_0_151637.wav	We will be using these four keys to access data	dev
audio_0_184650.wav	I have 3 SNRs, gamma 1, gamma 2, gamma 3	dev

audio_0_236002.wav	Business has the potential, to provide a major contribution, to our societies, in terms of, producing the products and services, that we want providing, employment, taxes, etcetera	dev
audio_0_191116.wav	So, any ideal of the ring of integers has the form nZ remember what is a nZ	dev
audio_0_71956.wav	We can also say that a project is a set of activities undertaken within a defined time period in order to meet specific goals within a budget	dev
audio_0_32459.wav	So, this method that we did it is also called pulse basis and delta testing	dev
audio_0_107709.wav	Now, exclusive privileges were granted by the king or the queen to enable craftsman very talented craftsman to come from continental Europe and to setup the businesses here	dev
audio_0_223509.wav	So, this is what the general principle of these inductive solutions is that you do not write to choose one or the other	dev
audio_0_58189.wav	so we consider a netlist consist of a number of gates	dev
audio_0_92179.wav	So, this F dot Tds that was the integrant therein, in this curve integral	dev
audio_0_207551.wav	So, the same last window that we are we were discussing can can be seen here	dev
audio_0_54717.wav	in the electrical case i had susceptibility defines such that epsilon naught chi times e gave me polarization	dev
audio_0_195401.wav	And how much should this be	dev
audio_0_198408.wav	Now, to calculate the input resistance, I connect a voltage source, V test between this point and ground	dev
audio_0_73080.wav	It does not indicate the absolute size of the return	dev
audio_0_208735.wav	After that, divide the circle into 8 equal parts	dev
audio_0_209849.wav	Once that is done, we have to make 50 mm and 75 mm distances on locus d from c	dev
audio_0_35753.wav	Now, if you remember when we had redefined our Maxwell’s equations we had got these coordinate stretching parameters	dev
audio_0_56329.wav	so after that there will be a delay of the flip flop, delay of this flip flop plus delay of the or gate, delay of the or gate plus setup time for the next flip flop before the next clock can come	dev
audio_0_35384.wav	So, in terms of speed FEM was very very fast and volume integral is much more time consuming	dev
audio_0_178030.wav	So, here is a simplified way of visualizing the link budget you have the transmitter that you can assume that as the output will be the power amplifier that gives you a signal at a certain level	dev
audio_0_181368.wav	And the types of porting that we see today most of the time you are in the same region, but you want to change your operator	dev
audio_0_235959.wav	I also do not understand it fully	dev
audio_0_178986.wav	And the capacity with outage capacity, with outage is given by, because this is a the assumption are that it is a slowly varying channel and it sort of a what we call as a block fading channel	dev
audio_0_185896.wav	So, for example, you could pick this point and the objective function value at that point would be corresponding to a contour which intersects this point	dev
audio_0_27014.wav	We could either drop the first letter a i or the second letter b j, and then we have to consider two sub problems	dev
audio_0_19513.wav	Unless and until the selling price and variable costs don't change, there will be only one PVR	dev
audio_0_72181.wav	This represent the progress achieved so far	dev
audio_0_13852.wav	61 right, and and this side; that means, your , the horizontal side it will be 50 cos, your 50 , cos your, your, 52	dev
audio_0_138268.wav	So therefore, when this is pressed, this will, this will open and this will close, this will close, so these points will close and the supply will get, will get connected to exhaust, so that is this rectangle, these are standard, you have also seen them during the hydraulics codes, so we will go we are going little fast on this	dev
audio_0_181631.wav	So, that will happen on the random access channel that is on the uplink the mobile responds	dev
audio_0_222302.wav	So, we argued that we could easily do this for small graphs visually, but if you want to write an algorithm, we need a way of representing the graph	dev
audio_0_130041.wav	ok, so the voltage drop across the resistor is rc	dev
audio_0_235454.wav	Now, for organizations, that focus on individuals, socialization is important	dev
audio_0_56666.wav	so there is a parallelism involved here	dev
audio_0_231451.wav	But understand that even if you are a perfectionist	dev
audio_0_213393.wav	just to give you a feel of how one can develop hardware products in a i o t, how you can actually build i o t products for several applications	dev
audio_0_201255.wav	1 times KM, that is the current factor has increased by 10%	dev
audio_0_145182.wav	So if the frequency or the rate of arrival or whatever we give name to this, if we arrange the tasks in this order, then the priority should be increasing in order of their frequency or decreasing in terms of their period	dev
audio_0_194824.wav	We have RD across the drain and source, RL across the small signal incremental picture	dev
audio_0_20444.wav	Suppose you are producing some item, it is consuming direct material	dev
audio_0_158857.wav	Just to refresh your memory, it is a one transaction happens, then completely commits, and then the next transaction starts and then the third transaction starts	dev
audio_0_80672.wav	Even there is a finite mismatch between my VDSA and VDSB; that means, Allen or Holberg proposed that by using the cascaded kind of current mirror, we can reduce the error generated in the simplest current mirror circuits	dev
audio_0_209255.wav	So, first normal to that	dev
audio_0_80152.wav	So, circuit becomes little bit more complex	dev
audio_0_164115.wav	5 milli farads so that becomes 5 into 10 t the power minus 4 farad	dev
audio_0_63699.wav	we have seen some methods or techniques which can be use at the level of gates, or at the so called atrial level design	dev
audio_0_150643.wav	And as the pattern on the course, we will do some basics now in the first part of this week then I will get into some research questions or questions that one could answer using the data that is been collected on crimes from these social media services itself	dev
audio_0_195254.wav	Similarly, if ID is greater than I 0, VD goes on decreasing, and if ID is greater than I 0 we actually want to reduce VG	dev
audio_0_4765.wav	It should be turned off	dev
audio_0_95162.wav	in order to attract the attention, that you will do, because you know you have to write it a straightaway	dev
audio_0_152720.wav	So, first thing to notice is that his palm is open and available for the audience to see from the get go on he continues to do this	dev
audio_0_176563.wav	Because outcomes of learning has been the concern of educationists, education psychologists and so many people for several decades, maybe more than 60 70 years	dev
audio_0_103156.wav	Welcome to Module 28 of Programming in C++	dev
audio_0_99456.wav	The public method simply prints the data member	dev
audio_0_204933.wav	So, this entire diameter if we are going to show it by leader line 5 10 units	dev
audio_0_156686.wav	So that is a a fail stop assumption is that the data on the non volatile storage is not lost due to any problem, system crash, power failure, etc	dev
audio_0_11701.wav	So, that is why this example is taken such that maximum value and rms value all the concept our concept will be clear	dev
audio_0_18865.wav	And this is my 40 kilo ohm right	dev
audio_0_201351.wav	So they should also give you a feel for first of all how to sketch the characteristics and what the most transistor characteristics look like	dev
audio_0_46108.wav	Let us close the circuit, the schematic and now you see that in the DCDC folder we have rectifier	dev
audio_0_173521.wav	And who are the main stakeholders	dev
audio_0_220384.wav	So, let us assume that we have these two parts	dev
audio_0_10590.wav	So, and it is your half C 1 plus C 2 that is 25 micro farad actually, that is 25 into 10 to the power minus 6 400 so, 5000 micro joule but here it is 5800 micro joule	dev
audio_0_102791.wav	So, this will at least not have the size issue, but it can be used also to cast two integers as well as from integer	dev
audio_0_166270.wav	So, let us take one example say if the signal flow graph is like this where you have from here you have a input say Rs	dev
audio_0_19190.wav	What we really want is total contribution and deducted from fixed costs	dev
audio_0_84035.wav	oOutput signal follows the input signal with a voltage which is smaller than the input signal	dev
audio_0_131486.wav	so what i have is i have to point here compressor inlet and compressor outlet	dev
audio_0_190668.wav	So, these are elements of R; these are not in R	dev
audio_0_50029.wav	i am leaving this ah exercise for you can find out curl of a in spherical polar coordinate systems	dev
audio_0_57521.wav	so v timing is a simple technique, as we have illustrated through this example, where the clock cycle time, which was earlier twelve, we have been able to bring it down to ten	dev
audio_0_18335.wav	Otherwise that 50 percent energy missing if you had considered that you should have found actually ah it is here in the parasitic inductances right that because it is missing means; that means, some where it has gone ; that means, some where it is stored	dev
audio_0_83129.wav	So, there are some there all this noise may be present in the system, and it may not be possible to remove the effect that is caused because separate the effect of the noise on the system	dev
audio_0_89283.wav	) The next thing is to scan the entire application in order to find one location which can be exploited for a buffer overflow	dev
audio_0_112224.wav	So, if you were your original impedance if it falls on region 1 then you will have to take 1 strategy then region 2 regions 3, region 4	dev
audio_0_228717.wav	So, this is a positive value and when we need to add the correction factor; the correction factor is whatever the value comes	dev
audio_0_101995.wav	And, that is the first function that will get called by the system	dev
audio_0_29826.wav	Maybe the whole idea of nations or nationalism of being wrong, then which is at times a political thing also is to pump upright and that immediate threat	dev
audio_0_149026.wav	So, they getting space gain negative, they are losing space	dev
audio_0_97503.wav	So, I am just using some wavy notation that this is where the derived class D is derived through a protected manner	dev
audio_0_183169.wav	Now, by the definition of being in FDD system you would expect that GSM also has a requirement of a duplex filter	dev
audio_0_193153.wav	They can be something a coefficient, something like b n b i bar X power I, c i bar X power j, where i plus j is equal to n and b i bar and c i bar are in Z mod p Z X, right	dev
audio_0_223304.wav	So, this greedy strategy is clearly flawed	dev
audio_0_180547.wav	The first thing you will ask for is the performance in AWGN, performance in AWGN where you have a fixed SNR	dev
audio_0_221315.wav	So, it is a very similar thing, we just have just these operations of OR and AND, instead of min and plus	dev
audio_0_14738.wav	So, in this case, this this is your V o c; this is open this is v o c terminal is 1 2, so that means, short circuit current it is 0 here it because that is open	dev
audio_0_10477.wav	1 farad is there, voltage across is v c this 5 ohm resistor and this is 55 and 15 both are in series and taken separate given separately and current through is i x and voltage across 15 ohm resistor is vx you have to you have to find out initial values of the your capacitor voltage that is your 10 volt is given v c 0	dev
audio_0_183609.wav	And always good for us to keep in mind if you are talking about GSM what is the duration of one time slot, one time slot corresponds to 577 microseconds	dev
audio_0_153681.wav	We definitely have to look at the context in order to ascertain the complete meaning, but this meaning becomes clear on the basis of the proxemics and related signals which are being sent	dev
audio_0_91662.wav	So, welcome back to lectures on engineering mathematics two and this is lecture number 29 and we will continue our discussion on polynomial interpolation	dev
audio_0_225504.wav	So, let us start with a very naive two dimensional structure, just to show how we can get drastic improvements, just I moving from one dimension, two dimensions	dev
audio_0_127226.wav	so lets say this is v not and this is r, two r, r and r	dev
audio_0_196805.wav	C2 would have been there	dev
audio_0_80771.wav	So, here the critical frequency would be f l	dev
audio_0_178451.wav	So, there is a good chance that may be next slot may be ok	dev
audio_0_226193.wav	So, till now what we saw major diameter, major diameter measurement, then minor diameter measurement, then we saw effective diameter measurement, effective diameter measurement	dev
audio_0_14758.wav	So, I SC is equal to 0, so it will be 4 it is open circuit right	dev
audio_0_220586.wav	So it has some nodes, these dots and edges	dev
audio_0_172957.wav	They may change with time based on the feedback given by various institutes but that kind of modifications will take place once in a few years	dev
audio_0_179453.wav	So, I am helpless	dev
audio_0_68970.wav	So, you see that if we try to demarcate them as different layers say for example, this is layer 1, this is layer 2, this is a layer 3	dev
audio_0_84921.wav	Common collector amplifier, right, it is a voltage follower, but can increase the current is follows a voltage, but current is amplified, right	dev
audio_0_40525.wav	So, both of these terms will come from here as before right U 1 N 1 1 x plus U 2 N 1 2 x first term and another term which is coming from integration over	dev
audio_0_210826.wav	So, here ellipse is shown by these dashed lines; the major axis is this longest one, and the minor axis is this shortest one	dev
audio_0_196181.wav	I mean, my original value of Vs is 5	dev
audio_0_118189.wav	and if we ah look at the token exchange mechanism, so the user to the keystone, ah, it is the for the identification or authentication	dev
audio_0_215484.wav	so let me go to the next page, ok, so essentially, when you talk about r f i d systems, you talk about readers and you talk about tags	dev
audio_0_18792.wav	04 second right	dev
audio_0_80959.wav	If you go to the characteristics supply voltage we have seen this output	dev
audio_0_223051.wav	18 means d is less frequency than c, but somehow we assigned c to be a longer code	dev
audio_0_185983.wav	So, if you keep repeating this process, you are going to nd a contour here where I touch this line for the first time	dev
audio_0_217428.wav	as i said, the right way is rectal, otherwise temporal artery	dev
audio_0_74244.wav	So, I will just touch upon another type of migration	dev
audio_0_131673.wav	rather, it is a hollow tube, ok, sealed on both sides	dev
audio_0_162672.wav	So, everything from 0 to 2 pi integration that becomes 0; only the thing is who does not become 0 is J0 omega	dev
audio_0_169775.wav	You have to first see what is the rectangular	dev
audio_0_159143.wav	So this is essentially the definition of 2NF and this is equivalent to this definition	dev

audio_0_224540.wav	If you have an already sorted array in some sense, the pivot is always an extreme value	dev
audio_0_41071.wav	So, those are two polarizations that we can we can talk about and any general solution or any general problem can be answered as a superposition of TM and TE	dev
audio_0_32701.wav	I am going from here over the circle and like this correct	dev
audio_0_163491.wav	What is the array axis	dev
audio_0_95003.wav	that is, that is what i mean by a good appearance, because if you look presentable and and you know, it will be very easy for you to develop a sort of rap walk with the crowd	dev
audio_0_35004.wav	So, we have actually seen local ABCs in FEM, you have seen global ABCs in integral equation methods and we will look at absorbing media little bit later, but the simplest ABC to implement is; obviously, local ABC this guy	dev
audio_0_103037.wav	Here, we are trying to show how volatile could be useful	dev
audio_0_226327.wav	So, then there is a reconstruction happening, a fringe is happening and that is recorded at CC charge coupled device sensor it is getting done	dev

audio_0_205736.wav	The texts is read from the bottom using the horizontal guidelines; the horizontal guidelines are these one, with respect to that we have to see that; any line parallel to that horizontal, we will be in a position to see that	dev
audio_0_3524.wav	You are this is equal to this one and because V ab is nothing, but the V L	dev
audio_0_102079.wav	All those semantics are maintained so that as you move from single inheritance to multiple inheritance the basic properties remain same	dev
audio_0_3677.wav	So, r equivalent will be 3 plus your 5 into 2 by 5 plus 2 that is your 3 plus 10 by 7 ohm right	dev
audio_0_226364.wav	Is you put the focal you add the eyepiece, you will always have this is as the cross wire	dev
audio_0_122182.wav	So, one has to gather all the important and specific features one is interested in in the process of close reading	dev
audio_0_149.wav	So, it can indicate either a control or a lack of a control, it can indicate or interpret the process which are in control, those are which are out of control where we can change the focus from in control to out of control process	dev
audio_0_212059.wav	so, madhiri, we will now demonstrate three different types of lenses that should be accompanied with any p i r system	dev

audio_0_21879.wav	so it is just, if you are not careful, you are casual, then you may end up with a nonsense behavior	dev
audio_0_165902.wav	Now, the question is that how to solve it	dev
audio_0_61751.wav	so there are two alternatives	dev
audio_0_190454.wav	So, we I will give you some sets and we will decide if they are rings or not	dev
audio_0_11812.wav	69 angle 22	dev
audio_0_149469.wav	And we initialize the categories as user 1, user 2, user 3, user 4 and user 5	dev
audio_0_27248.wav	So, remember when you write out text very often we cannot see the spaces the end of the line because they are invisible to us	dev
audio_0_212550.wav	what about quality of service	dev
audio_0_160126.wav	So the graph database, the entire all the tuples, etc	dev
audio_0_117824.wav	so it's, it's say, truly a development platform and pass is suppose to be a developed platform	dev
audio_0_193091.wav	So, that this claim is proved already	dev
audio_0_162914.wav	This is an aperture you can say actually we I can analyze it this is a simply the top metal and bottom metal field with dielectric that is like parallel plate waveguide	dev
audio_0_160908.wav	Now, here is a point is that how does transactions happen, or the database commits these transactions, is that it brings the necessary data item from the disk to the main memory and changes the value in the main memory, right	dev
audio_0_212758.wav	there are basically three ways by which you can secure your mqtt broker	dev
audio_0_50458.wav	can this zero charge we distributed that means can i have not equal to zero	dev

audio_0_175651.wav	We noted that defining what constitutes knowledge is still a unsettled question philosophically	dev
audio_0_55847.wav	so what will be the your timing requirement	dev
audio_0_146757.wav	So, if EDF cannot run a set of tasks, it is not necessary to look for another scheduler which can run this task because there will exist no scheduler which can run it	dev
audio_0_159683.wav	So this is not a conflict	dev
audio_0_38702.wav	What is and it is correct and why would that be correct and why would this also be correct	dev
audio_0_100446.wav	they are indeed identical	dev

audio_0_207943.wav	If one is going with third angle projection, your front view and top view	dev
audio_0_223962.wav	Now, it is easy to see that if we have a graph with n vertices and it is connected and it does not have cycles, then it will have exactly n minus 1 edges, this kind of a graph is called a tree	dev
audio_0_207666.wav	This is the way we observe	dev
audio_0_174929.wav	Then you are inferring something	dev
audio_0_143434.wav	Now, fixed assets are there in the balance sheet	dev
audio_0_12820.wav	So, the complete response of equation 48 may be written as this can be written as something like this	dev
audio_0_188231.wav	When you do not have this luxury of knowing the true value this is where you stop	dev
audio_0_174125.wav	Here we say there need not be one to one correspondence between the units of a course and the COs	dev
audio_0_221570.wav	We are not claiming it is, if it is the shortest path, then the distance to k will be correctly computed	dev
audio_0_220010.wav	So, there is a union operation which merges partitions together and there is a find operation which has to keep track of which partition a set belongs to an element belongs to over time with partition	dev
audio_0_61832.wav	now a capacitor holds the charge and it does not instantaneously change the voltage across it, right	dev
audio_0_60231.wav	steiner tree means a set of points interconnected by horizontal and vertical segments, is called rectangular steiner tree, where some bends can be there allowed, even at points where there are terminals like here	dev
audio_0_220216.wav	So, our target is given a set of n points p 1 to p n to find the closest pair among them and it will be convenient for the analysis of the algorithm that we are going to suggest that no two points in this set have the same x or y coordinate	dev
audio_0_59885.wav	this transition can happen anywhere in the past, not exactly at zero	dev

audio_0_13136.wav	Along with that this 4 ohm resistance was there, so 4 and 4 both are in series	dev
audio_0_179017.wav	It will change the rate, that is captured inside the encoder, the other thing that it can change is the amount of power that is allocated	dev
audio_0_129801.wav	first of all, lets write down the voltages across every element	dev
audio_0_236256.wav	And the parents say that, it is necessary, to do the deal, to secure the family	dev

audio_0_184945.wav	So, basically gamma will be 0	dev
audio_0_235592.wav	But, you should know, what you need to learn	dev
audio_0_214964.wav	you control the transmit power and you make the range of the beacon small enough so that you entice the user to tell him to move in a particular direction, ah, which will give him the maximum discount at ah garment in that shop	dev
audio_0_185092.wav	You must use both the channels worse case you give equal power to both of them may be if you play around with the power levels you may see some benefit and of course, if you try hard enough you will come to this particular case 1	dev
audio_0_220422.wav	In other words, if I start at any vertex and look at the smallest edge attached to it, I can start with that because that must be in every spanning tree by the minimum separator lemma	dev
audio_0_211996.wav	we are denoting as ah this rectangular block, so i will continue to use rectangular	dev
audio_0_199087.wav	Now of course this is not something new	dev
audio_0_102625.wav	You are just making a fresh inference about the type it was some const used to exist in an object you are trying to create a reference which is a non constant one	dev
audio_0_191546.wav	So, it is one similarly what is the degree of cube root of 2 a real cube root of 2 over R, here also I should say is also one because it is irreducible polynomial is x minus cube root of 2	dev
audio_0_228711.wav	So, if I take third reading or result as r, ok, the delta R is equal to the reading that is from the instrument that is the mean value minus reading that is true value	dev
audio_0_144472.wav	Now you can see here type of the asset and estimated useful life	dev
audio_0_212517.wav	lets say, i will put http on one side and mqtt on the other	dev
audio_0_72512.wav	It needs for benefits management	dev
audio_0_161805.wav	So, only when there is a cycle in the graph, it can be detected that there is a deadlock	dev
audio_0_174163.wav	You just have to start with an action verb	dev
audio_0_153255.wav	I particularly refer to this painting The Cardsharps by the famous Italian painter Caravaggio who had painted this particular canvas in late 16th or early 17th century and he has drawn on kinesics the body postures to paint a libelous scene from the low everyday life of his contemporary society	dev
audio_0_215917.wav	where buy, you can be talking about a r f i d chip and lot of day on a lot of interface prince, through which you can connect sensors	dev
audio_0_178897.wav	So, we know the solution for 2 channel types, but in general very difficult problem	dev
audio_0_18330.wav	So, some parasitic effects is there for example, in more complete circuit model of a capacitor is shown like this, this is my C, but with that R s L s and R p is there right because conducting foils right ah you have some your your what you call some resistance	dev
audio_0_100842.wav	So, this itself is a call by value which will mean that this will again call the copy constructor and to call the copy constructor, it needs to do call by value	dev
audio_0_209561.wav	For that purpose we have some of the options	dev
audio_0_32186.wav	So, now like we will have a brief discussion of what are the kinds of basis functions	dev
audio_0_71672.wav	Several interactive cost estimation software are there, the packages available	dev
audio_0_157027.wav	Now for simplification, if we ignore half field partitions, the total number of transfers, therefore, this has to be multiplied because in every of this pass, the entire relation is red, etc	dev
audio_0_118545.wav	this cloud security, or the security issues in cloud, plays a extremely vital role in making this cloud computing popular	dev
audio_0_136492.wav	So typically production systems are categorized broadly into continuous processes and so continuous manufacturing and discrete manufacturing, so things which you can count as one two three, so you have watches you have bicycles this is manufactured discrete manufacturing on the other hand things which you generally measure not as numbers what does quantities like oil, steel, cement that is a continuous process right	dev
audio_0_33576.wav	As far as electrical engineers are concerned this A and phi are purely mathematical constructs which are helping us to solve the problems that is how electrical engineers look at it	dev
audio_0_216032.wav	then java, then ah, so many other related thing, including node j s right, so many other related applications which you can build, right, so that a p	dev
audio_0_33445.wav	So, there is a lot of terms that can that we can see are getting cancelled from here	dev
audio_0_164824.wav	We will connect these two nodes with each other with the help of the integration function which we discussed	dev
audio_0_27478.wav	node with value x then delete it	dev
audio_0_122067.wav	And that particular evening, if you go back to that extract, that particular evening, that bond, that employer employee bond is visionlessly broken in some respects	dev
audio_0_120484.wav	It's a very, very interesting point that we get in the story, isn't it	dev
audio_0_219125.wav	So, that you can look at up and see we already computed it	dev
audio_0_114066.wav	Now, what type of devices are tested, you see there is lot of a large list passive active various types of devices, various levels of integration you see transistors VCO's deceivers T r modules, T r modules are used in radars then those are also radar or high power devices satellites also use them at attenuators adapters dielectrics many things are tested	dev
audio_0_76074.wav	Focal Adhesions are more elongated in shape these are roughly 2 5 microns in length	dev
audio_0_43237.wav	What can I write for this what will the first term give me	dev
audio_0_67827.wav	So, you must have seen that there are two level of divisions which takes place one is the nucleus divide and then the cytoplasm divides	dev
audio_0_59180.wav	this was what we had in earlier, but with technology scaling so means we now have more accurate mechanism for fabricating these basic wires and this segments of these layouts	dev
audio_0_47629.wav	Recall that there is a battery that there is a battery which is capable of sinking current connected here and that is important for the operation of these type of circuits	dev
audio_0_173069.wav	You have to work out from the first principles	dev
audio_0_223192.wav	Another place where there is positive notion towards documents similarity is to look for web search	dev
audio_0_113925.wav	So, both the things should be simultaneously satisfied, if any of them is violated it is not unitary scattering matrix that means, the network is not lossless	dev
audio_0_98745.wav	Now obviously, when we learnt programming, when we learnt software design; a design can never be a something, which is very strongly cast in concrete	dev
audio_0_75275.wav	In the past few weeks; in the past few weeks we have discussed various papers I would like to list what are some reading assignments that you would have to do for the last one week	dev
audio_0_169183.wav	So the homogeneity and additivity both would be applicable when you have to use super position theorem to solve circuit	dev
audio_0_61396.wav	this means if x changes, does the output of f changes	dev
audio_0_189899.wav	So, first of all we want to factor	dev
audio_0_18805.wav	You have to find out your V 0 t	dev
audio_0_220906.wav	You can use the similar strategy for PrimÕs algorithm	dev
audio_0_108702.wav	Now, when you mention in the IP policy that patents will be filed for trestles of research, and when they are commercialized the revenue will be shared with the inventors, then that itself becomes an incentive for people to look at the quality and the quantity of their research out	dev
audio_0_70897.wav	Now let's look at some characteristics of software that are very important to our subsequent discussions	dev
audio_0_72767.wav	Initially the code is made to work and then it is restructured	dev
audio_0_100691.wav	I have defined a class which is a specialization of exception class so some throwing an object of my exception	dev
audio_0_206309.wav	Usually, the details which are available many that direction we will pick it as frontal view most of the times	dev
audio_0_203189.wav	We would like to construct a generator at this point	dev
audio_0_32859.wav	So, the first so the derivatives now will happen with respect to space first 1D by dx	dev
audio_0_170153.wav	So, you can cross verify with the help of the equation which we just written in case of the mechanical system	dev
audio_0_145524.wav	A real time operating system must have support for static priority level	dev
audio_0_68099.wav	You add both dividing plus differentiation factors	dev
audio_0_82055.wav	Now, let us let us keep it to AC, and to understand whether we can use it for AC or not we need to have another equipment called variable AC or variAC , which is V A R I A C	dev
audio_0_143941.wav	As the name suggests, it is about not showing profit unless it is extremely confirmed, but showing all losses whenever there is a slight likelihood of a loss	dev
audio_0_144227.wav	I think you all would have heard about Institute of Chartered Accountants of India or ICAI	dev
audio_0_121475.wav	So, the mother thinks that her daughter has behaved badly by accepting the coin from the Kabiliwala, a stranger, a fruit peddler, an alien to that social environment because this guy is from Kabul and he is visiting Kolkata to sell raisins and nuts and shawls and other things	dev
audio_0_121135.wav	So, the story has moved from Mirza's home to Mirz home and it's eventually going to move to the banks of the River Gomathe	dev
audio_0_208484.wav	Just to recap if we are having a right circular cone taking a horizontal slice we will get circle an inclined slice ellipse if this section is going to cut both the slants	dev
audio_0_43142.wav	So, I will represent a derivative and time by something like f of t plus delta t minus f of t divided by delta t; finite differences that is how I will implement a derivative, similarly for the spatial derivative	dev
audio_0_110091.wav	So, power is not a problem that is why they try to maximize those voltage etcetera from those designs	dev
audio_0_32462.wav	No that is what	dev
audio_0_229650.wav	Now if you go back today just now we discussed as the accuracy goes higher and higher the cost goes high; why does that happen	dev
audio_0_103425.wav	Certainly, it is very good to initialize all variables that we declare and define	dev
audio_0_155807.wav	Join is one of the very important algorithms in a database and there are different join algorithms that we will analyze	dev
audio_0_55891.wav	now, when data is coming here, the data must be kept stable for minimum amount of time	dev
audio_0_73204.wav	This layer where this software is present, this communicates with other layers, I mean upper layers and below layers and also other components are the same level	dev
audio_0_25789.wav	Now let us see whether there is a anymore problem here, okay we will do some problem here, suppose we want to eliminate this chloro cyclohexane	dev
audio_0_58768.wav	so i am showing you a cmos level transistor level realization of a two input nand	dev
audio_0_9288.wav	In general in general actually this should have been L 1 plus L 2 plus minus 2 M	dev
audio_0_90137.wav	So, let us see how this happens with a single instruction, okay	dev
audio_0_64865.wav	ok, so, as i said earlier, if a critical path gets cut many times, the delay can be an unacceptably high	dev
audio_0_34592.wav	So, this let us use a different color this guy over here is what I am going to call beta bar m otherwise I have to keep writing in integral everywhere right	dev
audio_0_161819.wav	That is part of this transaction	dev
audio_0_2674.wav	So, it it it will rotate in the direction of your what you call that your machine Fr right with that ns that same your synchronous speed	dev
audio_0_201105.wav	thing that will always be present is the voltage source used for the power supply and replace non linear elements by their small signal equivalents	dev
audio_0_95153.wav	i mean the way you respond	dev
audio_0_239632.wav	Come straight to the point	dev
audio_0_92219.wav	So, we will get the value as minus 27 pi	dev
audio_0_117236.wav	there is a omnipresent ah presence of different kind kind of sensors, starting from our mobile phones to different category of sensors, which is collecting huge volume of data which could have been used for processing and supporting different user applications	dev
audio_0_80887.wav	So, our output voltage is 0 right everything is taken care of, but what happens through the output voltage if the temperature rises to 50 degree almost double to this right	dev
audio_0_112228.wav	So, here we have seen that these four regions on smith chart region 1 region 2 whatever we said in region 1 basically we have the R is less than 1 R means the R bar x is x bar etcetera	dev
audio_0_51789.wav	so this is electric field produced by this charge, for this charge is moving, so r	dev
audio_0_168109.wav	Similarly you can say that if you connect the AC voltage source then how power would be dissipated by that particular element and when we equate the power for DC and AC we get the value of effective voltage	dev
audio_0_117376.wav	there will be a different other factors, like here may, because we are considering availability and bandwidth	dev
audio_0_6000.wav	That means the controlled voltage sources and controlled current sources right are useful in constructing the circuit models for many types of real world devices such as your such as your transistor, just hold down such as your transistor, then your transformer, then electrical machines and electronic amplifiers right	dev
audio_0_226489.wav	Success can be accepted, not defective, then go, no go is, ok, both are going in	dev
audio_0_27971.wav	Now just because we have declaration does not mean everything is declared statically	dev
audio_0_43874.wav	So, just; so, one last thing I’d like to draw your attention to is that there are two different parts of this magnetic field, one has a 1 by r dependence and the other has a 1 by r square difference	dev
audio_0_24234.wav	The last one went on top of the elephant and said, and touched its ears and said, Wow	dev
audio_0_216357.wav	so lets go back to this screen here and you can see it exactly reflects the ah data that praveen has captured	dev
audio_0_143678.wav	In that method what is done is here we go for a weighted average	dev
audio_0_221517.wav	It will have every grid point will be computed in the table even though most of them are useless	dev
audio_0_35662.wav	So, what are the physical interpretations that we can draw from this	dev
audio_0_149584.wav	Now in each of these axes, we need that we have particular labels, which is that for each point we need to know that what that particular point represents	dev
audio_0_142729.wav	So, for all the companies, the balance sheet is to be prepared as per this format	dev
audio_0_30036.wav	An any attempts so, fight them create sort of anxiety	dev
audio_0_153502.wav	The American expression time is money can be taken very literally in the US, a chatty bank teller whose lines moving slowly will cause customers to become impatient and you will also get an earful if the line has to wait because you have not filled out your forms ahead of time	dev
audio_0_172974.wav	So one can see the POs as a combination of disciplinary outcomes or technical outcomes along with professional outcomes	dev
audio_0_99419.wav	So far we have had three kinds of visibility of which two we have already discussed public and private, we will soon discuss protected visibility which applies to inheritance	dev
audio_0_73242.wav	It does not consider one of the major problem with function point is that it does not consider algorithm complexity of a function	dev
audio_0_65288.wav	but suppose i have this second scenario, which is a non sliceable floor plan or a so called wheel	dev
audio_0_149396.wav	Notice that the data key is still present, but it is an empty list now, meaning we have run out of responses	dev
audio_0_25690.wav	So first there is is retention of configuration, although there is SN2 attack if the OH attacks in an SN2 fashion and directly kicks out the NH2 then it would have been, you have to rotate it, so and then change the then oxygen will come I can show it here in the board, then the carboxy oxygen should come	dev
audio_0_33129.wav	So, this is the point where no approximations have been made, no boundary condition has been applied yeah	dev
audio_0_8280.wav	Inductor acts as your what you call that your short circuit, capacitor acts as open circuit to steady state of DC	dev
audio_0_224591.wav	Now, our solution to Quicksort avoids this duplication of space, but it is recursive	dev
audio_0_130254.wav	right, we can use fuel cell as a source of electrical energy or even hybrid vehicles	dev
audio_0_215187.wav	that comes from this board	dev
audio_0_141211.wav	For instance you have different emotions which have different patterns in the brain activation given	dev
audio_0_104991.wav	And, we have iterated through functions and pointers and the organization and the build process	dev
audio_0_228339.wav	So, they are now measuring the circle on other side on the y z plane	dev
audio_0_155998.wav	So this you can see that this is clearly going to be a little inefficient etc	dev
audio_0_4730.wav	5 ohm resistors in no current flows through figure 23 right	dev
audio_0_121214.wav	And now once the company forces are taking over the city, when they are invading the city, people move from the city to the countryside to get some help to seek the country as a haven	dev
audio_0_81678.wav	Now, if what happens if we decrease the input signal	dev
audio_0_191191.wav	So, I am going to stop this video here, but in the next video or in one of the next videos, I will show that the same result holds for polynomial ring in one variable or a field so, that I will do next	dev
audio_0_64580.wav	well, zero, zero test vector is useless for a and gate	dev
audio_0_231478.wav	So, somebody called YouTube, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, etc	dev
audio_0_187021.wav	18, 2	dev
audio_0_188253.wav	Since, knn is managed to predict all the no cases has correctly has no and all the yes cases correctly as yes, your accuracy is 1	dev
audio_0_86606.wav	So, we will be looking at during the course at buffer overflows and buffer overreads, heaps double frees and use after free, integer overflows and format string	dev
audio_0_201962.wav	Now, to attach the piston over it, we will select the piston for this	dev
audio_0_108081.wav	So, it improved the way, in which information was supplied to the customers and we will later on look at the dispute between Hindustan Unilever Limited and Amul where, the fact that information supplied through the mark led to dispute between these two entities	dev
audio_0_118574.wav	so ah, we also have seen this is a slide again where there is a ah, on demand services, value of on demand services	dev
audio_0_159028.wav	of 1 which is transaction 1 releases the S lock on A	dev
audio_0_122180.wav	So, one can look for details about all these elements in terms of the process of close reading	dev
audio_0_63433.wav	so this example shows if you have multiple choices, you explore all the alternatives and select the best one, and that there is namely merging five and six	dev
audio_0_53145.wav	x is going to be square root of x square plus z square and i am going to take the component, the x direction	dev
audio_0_203170.wav	We are in module number 2 and lecture number 20	dev
audio_0_167336.wav	So, in the input port we are applying V1 voltage and we will find out the current I1, while at the other end V2 is there but current I2 is 0	dev
audio_0_150731.wav	For example, currently in terms of Rio somebody says that currently India has won medal and here is the video of the match	dev
audio_0_94538.wav	so you should always think that there is no moment, as i said, when we are not communicating	dev
audio_0_60158.wav	so, across all the grid points i am doing this, i am drawing so many trail lines	dev
audio_0_169386.wav	So this is something which we discussed in the previous class, where we analyse the various resistor, inductor and capacitor elements	dev
audio_0_113384.wav	So, generally this choice is made that S 21 and S 34 they though they are complex we take the reference that they are their phase are 0	dev
audio_0_227018.wav	These two major equipments for linear angular measurements, I am discussing in this module	dev
audio_0_201696.wav	We will not be in a position to see this back side portion and this line	dev
audio_0_78402.wav	So, this suggests that Inhibition of MMP activity perturbs integrin stability at the membrane	dev
audio_0_217804.wav	so that is one thing	dev
audio_0_12453.wav	9 and it is 18 Kilowatt; so, 18 upon 0	dev
audio_0_182168.wav	The Fourier transform will be root t Sinc f t delay of minus t by 2 e power minus j pi f t again basic Fourier transforms and the reason that we are interested in is and if this is g of t, g of t let me call this as g of f	dev
audio_0_170237.wav	Now, when you transform this through 1 by S as a block you get the value of i s here	dev
audio_0_210350.wav	Similarly P 1, P 0; P 2, P 0 cross products we will construct	dev
audio_0_62179.wav	ok, so all this things we shall be discussing later	dev
audio_0_103169.wav	So, let us start with an example	dev
audio_0_119984.wav	secondly, the amount of energy spent ah in maintaining this ah type of infrastructure is enormous, right and what	dev
audio_0_205654.wav	Though the real object having 90 degrees angle orthogonal to each other; but when we are showing isometric projection on the two dimensional plane, the edges, the axis isometric axis those makes 120 degrees equally on all sides, this is the first thing what we learn	dev
audio_0_101870.wav	It is in the prime of its lifetime, till it reaches the return statement	dev
audio_0_28965.wav	A list as we saw is a sequence in which we can freely insert and delete values all over the place	dev
audio_0_117138.wav	there are ah, some ah gateway with which it connects to the rest of the world	dev
audio_0_221577.wav	So, a natural question to ask is what sequence of updates should I do in order to actually get the shortest path	dev
audio_0_179979.wav	So, if you were doing a 16 QAM example I know we have not done this before	dev
audio_0_235082.wav	But, you keep putting in, as much as, you want	dev
audio_0_44944.wav	At present in this type of topology you will see that this controller has to handle the entire swing of V 0	dev
audio_0_10111.wav	So, K V 2 is equal to V 2 dash because V 2 dash is equal to K V 2	dev
audio_0_99668.wav	Next we show something, this is just for your understanding of completeness, I will not get much in depth	dev
audio_0_46538.wav	So what has happened to all this energy lost from here to here	dev
audio_0_193636.wav	What I should write is a minus axc is 0 that means, a times 1 minus xc is 0	dev
audio_0_59444.wav	in this lecture we shall be discussing in some detail how this static timing analysis works	dev
audio_0_174876.wav	It may sound quite complex and profound but what you are doing is proving that lost power is proportional to entropy is only recalling	dev
audio_0_102451.wav	So, you can see that if I do star plus plus p, it will first increment	dev
audio_0_175075.wav	Now the way you integrate may lead you to a completely different mindset, here what you are calling the highest level as inspirational insight	dev
audio_0_56928.wav	so this is the memory requirement for every cell in the lees algorithm with this kind of numbering	dev
audio_0_30358.wav	So, a lot of old people will have some recent memory deaf states and some sort of confusion and lot of people are on medication actually, we do not know the effect of medication	dev
audio_0_113021.wav	2 or 3 something they are giving	dev
audio_0_100581.wav	What you have in java is a reference is actually a pointer, but it is a constant pointer that you cannot change it	dev
audio_0_166937.wav	In this session we discussed about the maximum power transfer theorem, Norton’s and Thevenin theorem with respect to our AC circuit analysis	dev
audio_0_47026.wav	But let me show you how to go about doing that	dev
audio_0_25773.wav	So here the more that means this is the, here all the this is the more populated conformer and the most populated conformer also giving the more stable product the or the also reacting the faster rate and resulting in a , more stable product via a transition state which, is more stable than the transition state which is , involved in this elimination from this conformation	dev
audio_0_191245.wav	Hence, if a 1 is not 0 then a 1 squared, a 1 a 2, a 1 a n are distinct elements	dev
audio_0_166316.wav	So, now let us take one sample differential equation say this is very common equation which you might have seen	dev
audio_0_224161.wav	So, notice that 8 still has two pending requirements namely 5 and 7, so it cannot be done yet, but 3 and 5 are available	dev
audio_0_60820.wav	so instead of creating the initial placement absolutely randomly, we use some intelligence to create a reasonably good placement	dev
audio_0_14215.wav	Or your ah you have minus 6 and minus 2 so, minus 8 plus 2 i plus v 0 2 v 0 minus v 0 is equal to 0, right this is equation 1	dev
audio_0_113725.wav	A journey of a power wave for a time t whether both source to load or load to source is mathematically a phase change by e to the power j 2 omega t this 2 please note because it is a power wave	dev
audio_0_227117.wav	02 is the tolerance this is acceptable	dev
audio_0_94525.wav	so we can say that the perception of one may not be the perception of others	dev
audio_0_122087.wav	This particular evening, he doesn't do that	dev
audio_0_5529.wav	So, if you plot like this it will be and an omega C minus 1 upon L omega less than 0	dev
audio_0_2655.wav	The net speed of the rotor field as seen from the stator is it will be just n plus ns minus n is equal to n s	dev
audio_0_135830.wav	Yes, we are going to discuss them	dev
audio_0_223380.wav	So, this is an order n scan sorting takes order n log in, so overall this greedy strategy is correct and it takes time O n log n	dev
audio_0_155938.wav	Now the locking when it is done at different levels, that the following thing happens	dev
audio_0_207489.wav	So, I have that object	dev
audio_0_153310.wav	You might have visited a friend and you have being served a pudding or a piece of cake or some cookies, which are atrociously prepared	dev
audio_0_173072.wav	That means if you are giving an experience to your students and facilitating them to identify problems, then only you are meeting this PO	dev
audio_0_2000.wav	Zero does not means your, what you call that it is your what you call zero your it does not mean that you will become balanced, because these parameters are taken in such a fashion	dev
audio_0_109166.wav	It required that computer programs should be treated as literary works and compilation of data or databases should also be treated as intellectual creations	dev
audio_0_115777.wav	there is another aspect of dynamics: shutdown if the things are ah not utilized	dev
audio_0_188422.wav	Now another way to check this linear dependence is to calculate the determinant of this matrix, and when we calculate the determinant of this matrix, you will get 1 times 4 minus 2 times 2, which is 4 minus 4 which is 0	dev
audio_0_226905.wav	So, it will have X axis might be time and Y axis can be anything as magnitude	dev

audio_0_39101.wav	There will be some intermediate variable which I do not actually care so much about; I mean this observer over here just wants to know potential	dev
audio_0_64261.wav	but in clock, whenever you have a wire connection, that will incur additional delays	dev
audio_0_131153.wav	so, during peak hours, what happens is the accumulators	dev
audio_0_214617.wav	one example is the cortex m four	dev
audio_0_131547.wav	so therefore, if we know the input energy, ah, what we could find was that is equal to m, c, p, delta, t	dev
audio_0_182137.wav	Sometimes the in the military they also knew you do what is called a tone jammer; that means, just a strong tone	dev
audio_0_77314.wav	So, this is called is called as shear and you can have again this displacement at the top which is delta x and let us say this block is of height h	dev
audio_0_73655.wav	We have already seen that various methodologies are there	dev
audio_0_178246.wav	Especially if it is difficult for us to already estimate the pdf of the SNR	dev
audio_0_89076.wav	Therefore when the response goes back to the server, the server would be able to identify that this response does not match the response stored in the database and therefore it would reject the device, it would say that the authentication is not successful, so one aspect that is an issue with PUF based authentication technique is the case of the man in the middle	dev
audio_0_201535.wav	The outside object, 3 units and the extreme one this is 4 units	dev

audio_0_84876.wav	So, do not forget, if you set a gain extremely high, then even 0	dev
audio_0_103801.wav	So, this is something member function is a completely new concepts for C++ no parallel of this exist in C	dev
audio_0_75997.wav	And they showed that in the presence of this, there was an increase this led to increased tractions, increased adhesion	dev
audio_0_149491.wav	So, if I click on day one, the graph now shows the values for 3 other days	dev
audio_0_190588.wav	So, the set is this	dev
audio_0_61522.wav	this process is continued until all of the shadows has been obstructed and is repeated by every block or feature in the layout	dev
audio_0_86073.wav	As a result, we will get an output which looks like this, you see that there is a stack smashing detected and the program is terminated	dev
audio_0_169412.wav	Now since you know v is equal to L by dt, so i can be written in integral form, right and the same has been utilised here to find out the value of total current	dev
audio_0_156108.wav	And then IX meaning there is something inside is locked for writing	dev
audio_0_231153.wav	When we talk about indirect measurement, in this method several parameters are measured directly and then the value is determined by mathematical relationships what I have already told you density	dev
audio_0_146283.wav	, even though the priority of T4 is 6, which is greater than T3, but then it is requesting a resource which is idle, CR2, it will not be granted because in the priority grant clause, the priority of T4 will be compared to the current system sealing and since the current system sealing is more than the priority T4 T4 will not be allowed to lock the resource	dev
audio_0_157121.wav	Now if that is rolled back, then all that work needs to be done	dev
audio_0_39073.wav	So, the prime coordinates are the source points and this over here is the observer point	dev
audio_0_106933.wav	Then these rights offer a set of Rights intellectual property Rights be it patents trademarks copyright designs; they offer a set of rights it is actually a bundle of rights to the right holder and these bundle of rights also varies in the case of a literary work	dev
audio_0_90863.wav	However unlike the previous exploit that we have seen where code is executed from the stack in this particular attack we do not execute any code form the stack and in this way the attack would run even with the NX bit defense that is present for that particular stack	dev
audio_0_163145.wav	Go to five, so we should have four 1, 2, 3, 4; ten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9	dev
audio_0_63723.wav	now each of these multipliers will be carrying out multiplication in time delta by two, but because there are two multipliers, the total throughput will still be delta	dev
audio_0_163526.wav	We require that this part should be how much alpha d minus k not d should be equal to plus minus pi	dev

audio_0_6399.wav	Nnow how we are getting it right	dev
audio_0_190783.wav	So, the proposition that I want to prove and this is useful because it will allow us to check noetherian rings in some cases is that, a ring is noetherian if and only if every ascending chain of ideals in R stabilizes ok	dev
audio_0_117417.wav	similarly, this is on the ah average ah response time	dev
audio_0_1641.wav	So, it will be i 1 R 1, right, then your plus i 2 into your i your i 2 into R 2 minus v is equal to 0 i 2, we have told that i 1 minus i 2	dev
audio_0_52286.wav	Square of that is going to be x square plus a square by 4, times unit vector in this direction	dev
audio_0_58412.wav	ok, similarly, for the fault x i stuck at one, the only changes i use x i prime, x i dash, because now x i has to set will revere value which is zero	dev
audio_0_33060.wav	So, yeah, it will become clear why I am chosen supposing I choose the delta testing functions ok	dev
audio_0_103406.wav	Void is not a type, it is very interesting use and as we go into C++, we will see various different use of void	dev

audio_0_175789.wav	And a person with good metacognitive skills will be able to do that	dev
audio_0_178979.wav	So, that is a important element that we are able to work with and to and to get out of our system	dev
audio_0_186433.wav	So, we are into the last theory lecture of this course	dev
audio_0_222715.wav	So, supposing we have this list or array of six elements	dev
audio_0_121097.wav	So, do we have any kind of contrast in the story which is about pleasure	dev
audio_0_14330.wav	So, this 10 ampere is also mark this 10 ampere and outgoing current if I take here	dev
audio_0_195378.wav	As I said, RDS is important for the output resistance, for other things it makes a small change and nothing else	dev
audio_0_166591.wav	Similarly, for network b also we can write V 1b I 1b as an input vector equal to ABCD parameters for network b multiplied by vector output vector of V 2b and minus I 2b	dev
audio_0_114149.wav	Now, it can separate these incidents and reflected as you see here that	dev
audio_0_206262.wav	For this one similarly, the side view what we got is this one and the top view what we got is in that way	dev
audio_0_23303.wav	So emotional they are unable to regulate their emotions in the right way why why a person will be too sensitive whatever it is happening in this world they attribute to tension	dev
audio_0_75790.wav	So, the cell is trying to move outward in this direction the cells speckles are moving inward	dev
audio_0_201182.wav	We will come to this later	dev
audio_0_96539.wav	then you say you try to be neutral and then, in order to be neutral, you actually become so cumbersome that you used it would be unreasonable to assume	dev
audio_0_174240.wav	This is still vague	dev
audio_0_157733.wav	And then the same thing is that t or t 2 is rolled back	dev
audio_0_184862.wav	Again we just refer to the basic discussions on concepts of capacity that you would have studied in digital communications which is linked to the concepts of entropy and mutual information between transmitter and receiver	dev

audio_0_80054.wav	It is kind of opposite to band pass filter right	dev
audio_0_148920.wav	Suit a trending event the some event that is going on let us take IPL – cricket, football I would change my handle to look very similar to them, and therefore, I will get more of attraction	dev
audio_0_186195.wav	That means, you will use samples 2, 3, 4 up to n to build your model and once you have built the model you test the performance of the model or predict for this sample that you have left out and you will get an MSE for the sample	dev
audio_0_12592.wav	So, it will be look into that it will be 12 i 1, because i 1 is flowing like this 12 i 1, then it will be minus 2 i, 2 because i 2 is moving like this, but we are moving anticlockwise	dev
audio_0_28405.wav	How does this work in python	dev
audio_0_45368.wav	Here this is where energy half LAM square and the capacitor the output diode with all those things and then finally the outputing it outputting it to a file and the display	dev
audio_0_189480.wav	Now I am want to classified based on the car type	dev
audio_0_29184.wav	So, x is not none is much easier to read the next not equal to none	dev
audio_0_186883.wav	So, while this looks little complicated, this is written in this way because it is easier to write this as one expression	dev
audio_0_200302.wav	So, instead of this, what we do is we have a 200 microampure current source and we compare that to the actual drain current of the transistor, whatever that is	dev
audio_0_30874.wav	So, but you have raised an important point this choice of we said that in Galerkin’s method the shape basis functions and the testing functions are the same, but we still have a little bit of freedom	dev
audio_0_34457.wav	So, these guys electric fields they are coming from the calculation from the Yee cells	dev
audio_0_47530.wav	So the voltage of this will rise correspondingly to turn on this diode and allow for the freewheeling path	dev
audio_0_63123.wav	so the first four i can keep in the first partition, second in the other partition	dev
audio_0_224527.wav	Because, the median is that element which splits the array into two parts, those half of the elements are bigger than the median, half are smaller than the median	dev
audio_0_48203.wav	so this gave you a minus sign here	dev
audio_0_198159.wav	Like I said, hopefully you understand all the logical steps leading to this	dev
audio_0_170325.wav	So, s will have a unit of inverse of second	dev
audio_0_151825.wav	Let's take both of are on whisper, you do your post and I come react to it, I do a reply to it, if you do not know it is PK, who is the faculty at IIIT Delhi or some profile that I have, if you do not know that it is me, will you continue talking to me	dev
audio_0_210345.wav	And, we would like to because it is a surface it might be having a curved shape	dev
audio_0_150154.wav	So, what we will do is, we will say frequencies is equal to counter all underscore tokens	dev
audio_0_44843.wav	However in most cases the input may not be a battery the input may be the AC grid itself if it is the AC grid then the input wave shape will be an alternating bi directional voltage wave shape to 30 volts RMS now this is not directly compatible to the DCDC converter input	dev
audio_0_122161.wav	So, this captures the cognitive interest of readers	dev
audio_0_170547.wav	So you will get eventually the same result	dev
audio_0_62426.wav	so you need more information to be stored	dev
audio_0_238430.wav	That is the team outcome	dev
audio_0_48731.wav	so t remains the same and therefore at this point this point feels a force period of t at this angle, which is at an angle theta	dev
audio_0_58064.wav	ok, so so in this method for floor planning, the floor plan is represented by a tree and the polish notation that i talked about earlier, that postfix notation, that same kind of postfix notation, is used for representation and also for manipulation of the moves	dev
audio_0_20680.wav	Sometimes this is also known as break even chart because we are showing break even here	dev
audio_0_115203.wav	i cannot make a optimal management of storage without ignoring the other component of the like network component and other things	dev

audio_0_119320.wav	ah, anyway, that total divided by the cardinality will be the average salary of the things	dev
audio_0_221990.wav	So, the pivot is just some value in the array, it need not be the median and we will see that if that is not the median, then this results in some problem in terms of the worst case complexity, but let us just ignore it	dev
audio_0_203332.wav	Instead of one revolution if two revolutions are passing we are going to extend this curve to two more revolutions by dividing into many more number of parts and smoothly connecting it; with this, we are closing conical sections	dev
audio_0_219842.wav	On the other hand, in the airline graph we had directions, we might have a flight from one city to another city, but not back	dev
audio_0_220323.wav	Because, sorting takes n log n time then having set of this recursive thing the overall recursive problem divides n points into two sets of n by 2	dev
audio_0_46129.wav	So the power diode is consisting of two parts, a model for the diode default diode and the sub circuit model for the power diode	dev
audio_0_174501.wav	It possibly starts at that time	dev
audio_0_113983.wav	Now, if I change that port that means, if I extend that port that terminal plane I can extend, I can then need to redefine the voltages and the S parameters will also get change so that means, see in this case that I have a network, I had the ports here port one, port two, port nine, etcetera	dev
audio_0_179354.wav	So, as I mentioned the goal is not to spend a lot of time in the mathematics, but the hopefully the inside that we have already obtained tells us	dev
audio_0_36360.wav	And that was really the power of this displacement current term over here which Maxwell was able to do right	dev
audio_0_54689.wav	having set up our machinery for calculating magnetic field with magnetic moment m, having introduces an auxiliary field h, we are now ready to deal with magnetic materials	dev
audio_0_235568.wav	Not realizing that, they would take up, so much of our time, that the time, we could have spent on achieving our long term goals, is being taken away	dev
audio_0_213967.wav	so you have two hundred mili watt, just two hundred milli watt, being dissipated across this regulator, which is also called the low dropout regulator	dev
audio_0_95537.wav	it so happens that when you take a decision, it may hurt because you took it as an individual, but when you took it as a team, every ones responsibility is involved there and you can have solutions as well	dev
audio_0_116422.wav	therefore, the data of one application may get compromised by the other	dev
audio_0_21578.wav	How did you get 12,000	dev
audio_0_120793.wav	So, this husband and wife, Papa ji and Gigi, they want a woman who is a contrast to Minakshi except for the fact of the education	dev
audio_0_105276.wav	And finally, I would advice that in module 18 when we started, we started with a motivation of building complete types, complete algebra for variety of different arithmetical types and others, so a complex number, fractions, string, vector matrices and so on	dev
audio_0_193359.wav	Remember that, the fact that Z X is noetherian is still true, we do not need this stronger statement that every ideal of Z X is generated by 2 elements, we only need this statement that every ideal of Z X is finitely generated	dev
audio_0_1323.wav	In this case although diagram I have taken these all these things I have taken from book right, but this is a N pole, this is N pole, this side is l, and this side is m right and this is your N and this is your P already marked here	dev
audio_0_100405.wav	So, on left we have a function which is a typical c return form in C++	dev
audio_0_62324.wav	lets take an example as follows: lets say we have an nand gate, we have an or gate and gate and another nor gate	dev
audio_0_165625.wav	In the previous case we saw the simple single output system	dev
audio_0_179379.wav	The first one is Rayleigh distribution you will have to when you go back you will have to draw this line that line basically says that is your average received signal level that is and you can see that is the type of fluctuation you will see when it is a Rayleigh distribution remember the 3 Ricean distribution that we will looked at take the last case K equal to ten	dev
audio_0_184362.wav	So, the satellite based a communications are OK, where there is no form of terrestrial coverage, but when terrestrial coverage is present satellite communications always becomes a more expensive technology because you need more power, you need to have you know more expensive equipment; when it comes to connecting a devices satellite will definitely not be at a option because the power required will not be anywhere close to what these low optimize power systems will achieve	dev
audio_0_205145.wav	So, if I am projecting that onto horizontal plane there is a 30 degrees thing	dev
audio_0_190419.wav	So, what I want to say is that it is finite, now so let us keep that aside what we have is K actually what we have is K, L prime and F, L prime contains L	dev

audio_0_32579.wav	That is sort of	dev
audio_0_8327.wav	So, current is the your i infinity is the V s by R	dev
audio_0_174205.wav	It should be written like that rather than merely say write a statement that represents internal changes	dev
audio_0_205300.wav	Similarly, E to E 1, E to E 1, because it is a pentagon naturally asymmetry is there in terms of this line	dev
audio_0_190060.wav	So, these are both irreducible factorizations, but 2 is not an associate of either of them this is something that came up earlier and this can be proved by proving this fact only units in R are 1 and minus 1	dev
audio_0_62308.wav	so the advantage of this method is that all faults are handled together in a single pass and therefore it is faster than parallel fault simulation	dev
audio_0_218976.wav	So, if I give you a formula and I claim that a given valuation is actually a satisfying assignment, all I have to do, is I plug in that assignment, like we did for the earlier case	dev

audio_0_37705.wav	Derivative of the incident being right	dev
audio_0_97879.wav	Now, we will go ahead and discuss some of the restrictions that must be followed while you are doing this	dev
audio_0_85012.wav	Now, you see substrate body right substrate body is P type and if I diffuse or if I dope the n channel into the P type, then this becomes my source and drain and because there is a p because there is a n there will be creation of this depletion region, there will be creation of depletion region as we can see from the schematic on the slide	dev
audio_0_17861.wav	So, V and V meaning is same here right so; that means, that this i is entering into that your what you call into this if you apply KCL here, if you apply KCL here then i is entering	dev
audio_0_99768.wav	So, the size of every element can be computed from using the size of operator in C, so you specify size of int which for a 32 bit system will pass 4, since int, typically in 32 bit is represented by 4 bytes as the third parameter	dev

audio_0_102168.wav	So, this is what is additionally required over single inheritance which will be very common because it is quite likely that the base classes that you are inheriting from may have one or more member functions which are have the same name between themselves	dev
audio_0_145315.wav	So, here based on a timer, the scheduler becomes active periodically and that is a clock driven scheduler	dev
audio_0_12860.wav	Therefore, say ah your that means, ah your using the fact that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, so which switch is close v 0 is equal to v 0 minus is equal to v 0 plus is equal to 30 volt right	dev
audio_0_217476.wav	both these places are ok to measure and that that is already so	dev
audio_0_228757.wav	So, type A uncertainty is due to the experiments which we are conducting due to the data that is obtained based one certain instruments, if uncertainty is not type A it is clearly mentioned it could be type B; which we are not considering, which are not a factors which we are controlling, and we are not working much on type B uncertainty; however, type A uncertainty is important	dev
audio_0_93235.wav	this does not mean that i am going to teach you grammar through this course, but i am simply trying to throw some light on our notions of correctness	dev

audio_0_74743.wav	So, if you plot the stoichiometry of lamin A to B	dev
audio_0_205699.wav	So, it will be 1 over root 2 by root 3 by 2, which is 0	dev
audio_0_135973.wav	And this is because the reader perceives Okonkwo both as a heroic figure who shows the courage to stand up to the white man’s coercion as well as an antagonist whose very presence is disruptive to the society to which he belongs	dev
audio_0_115302.wav	so whether i can ah partition request partitioning approach, follow a based on iterated local search ah to facilitate a cost efficient and online splitting of is your request among eligible cloud service provider	dev
audio_0_93816.wav	so when we have different perceptions, once again we do not want to listen	dev
audio_0_82006.wav	And in this particular multimeter, same point we can measure diode all right	dev
audio_0_224930.wav	So, we look for 91 and we find it, so we will interpret the insertion of 91 has something which does not disturbed the tree, because we earlier said we do not want to have duplicate values	dev
audio_0_182518.wav	So, this would become 1 plus D cubed plus D 4, and the linear shift register sequences, feed forward shift register sequences would be, a delay 4 delays is what I will need	dev
audio_0_211598.wav	it should give you a stable clock out in microseconds	dev
audio_0_131821.wav	that has been shown	dev
audio_0_102216.wav	So, you just focus within the ‘for’ loop, you see how the array elements are being accessed	dev

audio_0_20547.wav	The graph is totally flat	dev
audio_0_88853.wav	py and store the result in this file call E2 and then we run vuln again and give the input using cat E2 and give the input from the file E2, so what we see now is due to this maliciously formed string, it would trigger the system to execute and create the shell as before is missing with the regular buffer, this shell is what is present over here with the PID 4416	dev
audio_0_34291.wav	So, this is; obviously, clear that there is no J term in scattering problem, but what we can do is we can write down my E electric field as E incident plus E total and	dev
audio_0_83614.wav	Take the nptelNPTEL courses, learn, right	dev
audio_0_23754.wav	For example, if there is fundamental of entrepreneurship as a subject, like if you like, I personally like that subject	dev

audio_0_192378.wav	So, this is just definitely a function and it is an exercise in analysis to show that f plus g is actually continuous	dev
audio_0_212289.wav	but please note, some amount of current is also consumed quietly, quiescent current for the l d o to function	dev
audio_0_67806.wav	So, we are taking one step and the most challenging part of the game is something else	dev
audio_0_238969.wav	They also need some autonomy in their jobs	dev
audio_0_5083.wav	6 ; that means, sin theta one is equal to 0	dev
audio_0_180664.wav	So, just keep that characterization in your mind before it is good to know that this is a family of functions	dev
audio_0_132774.wav	so the ah by and when its connected to a generator and it rotates the generator	dev
audio_0_86202.wav	So, what this means is that given a particular challenge I can use the response to essentially identify which device has executed that particular function	dev
audio_0_181667.wav	And in selection combining we said there were, there was pre detection and then there was post detection ok	dev
audio_0_202036.wav	This dot asm file is the state of this assembly	dev
audio_0_91047.wav	So, what we will do is that we will enable each of these one by one and then we will see how this shell code is prevented	dev
audio_0_146070.wav	And then we can use the rate monotonic analysis results	dev
audio_0_78395.wav	And you look at without permeabilizing the cells you probe for integrins	dev
audio_0_93871.wav	but i am quite hopeful and i anticipate that all of you are very good listeners and you will enjoy listening not only to the lectures, but you will also listen it to learn and listen it to make yourself wise enough	dev
audio_0_77019.wav	So, now one important step is after you have made this poly protein you have to make sure you use Circular Dichroism, and other techniques to make sure that the protein folds and is stable, is stable	dev
audio_0_58994.wav	ok, broadly speaking, this diagram shows how we can categorize the basic types of faults, like like in the highest level, the faults can be categorized as permanent or non permanent, and the normal non permanent faults, on the other hand, can be categorized as transient or intermittent	dev
audio_0_89346.wav	So, let us say that this is the program binary in particular	dev
audio_0_118805.wav	so the, so the term we are having here is one plus two p by nm, right	dev
audio_0_208495.wav	For simple case, we are just showing only one of the foci	dev
audio_0_181524.wav	So, they did not want to make the equalizer more complex so that is why they limited themselves to 200 kilohertz	dev
audio_0_214889.wav	and the problem was in the earlier case was just restricted to thirty one bites, and now you get super two, fifty six bytes of payload, which is possible, and even the advertising channels were just restricted to three ah in four point two	dev
audio_0_60435.wav	so far, whatever clock gating methods we talked about and looked at, we said that, well, i have a circuit of functional block	dev
audio_0_230056.wav	So, we could make blocks on slip gauge, and these blocks for measuring height we used	dev
audio_0_195302.wav	So this common means that it is common to the two sides	dev
audio_0_46307.wav	Let us say I call this diode D1 and this is at zero volt if D1 is ideal	dev

audio_0_56951.wav	so what this [meta/method] method says is that you start the weight from propagation, not only from s but also from t, so wavefronts touch somewhere, so you get a path	dev
audio_0_187409.wav	So, we had, true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative	dev
audio_0_221427.wav	So, if I come, if I have something coming from here and here I will just ignore it and say this is 0	dev
audio_0_157401.wav	So that is how it keeps on growing and that is how it keeps on automatically adjusting it because you see that between K1 and K2 it is not just H0 that is the function, it is H1 because H0 has overflown	dev
audio_0_135413.wav	Semantic memory, we talked about episodic memory, there also we classified, that I witness and flashbulb could be to such important different distinct type of memories	dev
audio_0_218056.wav	let us go back to our starting point where we have a plus and the minus, our usual error amplifier, and, to be put back what i mentioned just now, we require a v reference	dev
audio_0_180399.wav	So, the understanding of a spectral broadening which is caused by multipath fading was introduced in this lecture Spectral Broadening	dev
audio_0_50630.wav	notice: if chi e is zero, then there is no p	dev

audio_0_63516.wav	so today no manufacture can effort to spend a lot of time in creating and optimizing the designs	dev
audio_0_131227.wav	so from there we can calculate the enthalpy, then ah	dev
audio_0_225859.wav	So, what we independent set is saying is this is time to pick out a solution, is trying to pick out a solution by looking at each clause	dev
audio_0_14741.wav	Look ah ah just before going to that solution, so this is we have to find out Voc	dev
audio_0_4652.wav	So, what now what is R Thevenin	dev
audio_0_176899.wav	Till then have a good time	dev
audio_0_104848.wav	But, from the fact that if my gCode is Cir and I want to call the draw, this draw should get called	dev
audio_0_47442.wav	And the voltage across the inductor, as I was mentioning earlier, is a point that you need to observe and that is a critical voltage	dev

audio_0_31638.wav	So, this is one manipulation that we did, so, we will keep this result with us we hold it in memory	dev
audio_0_165152.wav	So, these would be the three major steps which you will follow when you have to find the node voltages	dev
audio_0_90935.wav	Now in order that we terminate this particular program properly what we can additionally do is add a function exit over here which essentially has the address 281130d0, so therefore what happens now is the system function executes it takes slash bin slash bash pointer as argument and after that function completes this particular function which points to the exit function would get executed	dev
audio_0_35397.wav	Because I need to apply the boundary condition and there the simplest boundary condition which we have learnt are absorbing boundary conditions and for that we have seen that there needs to be a little bit of air gap between the object and where I terminate the boundary right	dev

audio_0_4576.wav	So, in this case, your again terminals 1 and 2 are open circuited with the load disconnected and turned off all the independent sources	dev
audio_0_146804.wav	But it's not popular, rarely used in applications	dev
audio_0_39483.wav	So, I am going to call this term over here as another there are many many simplifications that we need to do	dev
audio_0_11818.wav	92 angle minus 30	dev
audio_0_105270.wav	And you only overload those operators that you really need actually need to build up your type to build up your total algebra	dev
audio_0_16824.wav	So, in this case what will happe,n this is the current going through the primary winding	dev
audio_0_173222.wav	And what we have done in the first unit, we stated very clearly that the college or the department offering the program needs to design and conduct its programs to meet several stated outcomes to meet the accreditation criteria	dev

audio_0_93556.wav	no, so you have a degree with you, but then the knowledge which you had, and suppose you sat idle for two years and you were simply looking for jobs	dev
audio_0_197700.wav	And of course, drain can only be an output	dev
audio_0_110379.wav	So, you see the follow the steps then convert since our choice is a parallel something	dev
audio_0_11966.wav	So, this can be written as number of cycles per revolution into number of revolution per second	dev
audio_0_131671.wav	so this is that hot ambient that i was talking about	dev
audio_0_219701.wav	So, we go back and process 9; 9 has no more new things to say, because 9 the other neighbours are 6 and 8 which are already done, we go back to 8, 8 has nothing more to say so we go back to 6, 6 has nothing more to say so we go back to 5, 5 has nothing more to say so we go back to 4, now when we started this whole exploration you did it by 4 to 5	dev
audio_0_144716.wav	You have a printout of this, so have a look at it and try to solve the case along with me	dev
audio_0_50262.wav	for that lets write this b again	dev

audio_0_237035.wav	Who are selling, what we are selling, or something similar	dev
audio_0_11340.wav	So, in this case that means, the earlier we have seen that your v is equal to we have already seen know, v we have already seen for single phase circuit v is equal to v m let me clear it, v is equal to v m that sin of omega t	dev
audio_0_209015.wav	Now, this new view whatever we got that becomes the true shape	dev
audio_0_126895.wav	And what does this mean, so if let say you have a volt as V 1 which results in a current I 1 and voltage V 2, which result in a current I 2	dev
audio_0_217040.wav	sometime, if it is not a very old model one, the vibration is not really something that you can really ah, you are actually you don't, you don't like vibration, right, if it is vibrating, yeah, actually know that it's not very comfortable, so you actually in	dev
audio_0_203416.wav	So, whatever the dimension we would like to really specify that we can do that	dev
audio_0_135761.wav	Since then, Spivak has gone on to publish a number of books including In Other Worlds, Outside in the Teaching Machine, A Critique of Postcolonial Reason, Death of A Discipline, Other Asias, and more recently, Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization	dev
audio_0_202054.wav	Cylinder, we would like to construct	dev
audio_0_193450.wav	So, same notion I will use, a is irreducible if I want first of all that a should not be a unit; I do not want to call units irreducible for simplicity because I do not want to every time I am working in a proof or something I and I am working with irreducible elements, I do not want to assume that it is not the unit	dev
audio_0_187665.wav	So, when you want to concatenate these two lists you have to use this concatenation operator, the original list and then the new list	dev
audio_0_20872.wav	Now these budgets can in turn be grouped as physical budgets, cost budgets and profit budgets	dev
audio_0_224845.wav	For example, if you perform a in order traversal here, we start at the root and then we have to first walk on the lefts up tree, so we walk to the left child	dev
audio_0_121822.wav	Hello and welcome to this lecture on plotting the speciality of Tagore's Kabliwala	dev
audio_0_12054.wav	If you have some n such values right, then it will be your average area or what you call depends on the heating effect that is the square of the current because in DC circuit, we have studied the power loss is equal to i square r right	dev
audio_0_230999.wav	Therefore, a good knowledge of measurement technique is necessary for design of a control	dev
audio_0_142248.wav	And in our next class, we will start with profit and loss account	dev
audio_0_57128.wav	this is shown in these example, as we see now	dev
audio_0_103079.wav	The unfortunate part of the story is there is no easy fix for this in C	dev
audio_0_132853.wav	if i want to store it, which means the flywheel has to keep rotating and not slow down	dev

audio_0_147554.wav	Why do not you stop tobacco	dev
audio_0_120573.wav	But a good close reading will kind of bring out this theme that's there	dev
audio_0_183779.wav	So, now, if I combine this shift property and this correlation property, then I get a very interesting and a powerful result which is the take away from this discussion	dev
audio_0_63822.wav	so you can have various different types of clocking schemes	dev
audio_0_181366.wav	So, basically the information is that they must enter your information in a database just called as central database	dev
audio_0_130887.wav	this is one factor by which we should decide whether we should go for cogeneration or not	dev
audio_0_13234.wav	Mathematically, actually we can express this that your integration just before switching that is 0 minus to 0 plus delta t d t is equal to 1	dev
audio_0_187309.wav	The Nullity of the matrix tells you how many relationships are there or how many vectors are there in the null space	dev
audio_0_17303.wav	So, do not write ah your directly, then there will be then it will be an error mistake	dev
audio_0_90455.wav	It has relative positions of the pages in that enclave security flag associated and so on	dev
audio_0_185426.wav	Vruntime for a process, therefore will monotonically increase	dev
audio_0_135337.wav	And by that time we complete 7 days, 1 week period, we realize that the information is by and large stable now	dev
audio_0_39030.wav	So, in some sense I have to down sample that solution I mean I have let us say x 1 x 2 here, now you are saying I want to retrieve this at a	dev
audio_0_174808.wav	So one can say these represent a truly integrated experiences	dev
audio_0_14871.wav	So, at t tends to infinity that is your omega R infinity is equal to half L I 0 square is equal to omega 0 omega initially also showed	dev
audio_0_193617.wav	So, we have a divides b and b divides a	dev
audio_0_49727.wav	when the a	dev
audio_0_205393.wav	The second most thing is we always represent whatever the section we have employed with below section A A label we will show it	dev
audio_0_238822.wav	So, once you become a part of the organization, this is what, you have access to	dev
audio_0_142772.wav	We have discussed outstanding salaries or outstanding electricity bills or outstanding office expenses, outstanding stationary charges, so on, any expense which is not yet paid but is payable in one year	dev
audio_0_82768.wav	We observed that the output voltage decreases when we come below the cut off frequency	dev
audio_0_1532.wav	And similarly if you take a if you take a you are what you call suppose a dot suppose, this is the conductor suppose dot	dev
audio_0_236241.wav	The parents are, who is the direct contact, or, who is the go between, the liaison between, the product manager, and the family of the, or, the source of these carpets	dev
audio_0_147847.wav	For instance, now for this sub graph, let us choose an attribute which is in degree and apply	dev
audio_0_199560.wav	7 volts plus 100mmilovlt sine omega T	dev
audio_0_98939.wav	In cases, you cannot because of you want to mean something different or you want to mix up certain types and do some conversion, you will have to use the explicit instantiation	dev
audio_0_72346.wav	The agile methodologies is an umbrella term	dev
audio_0_101492.wav	So, what I should try to do next is to try to make them private, so that they cannot be changed directly	dev
audio_0_190787.wav	So, let me write like this, ideals in R, let this be an ascending chain of ideals in R and our goal is to show that it stabilizes right that is the implication in this direction, I am assuming R is noetherian and I want to show that this ascending chain of ideals stabilizes	dev
audio_0_182352.wav	The answer is yes not done anything to improve the signal to noise ratio and that is one of the fundamental things that you need to learn, that if you are impairment is only white noise, spreading does not help at all	dev
audio_0_222683.wav	So, there are n vertex in the graph, then even if a node has only two or three neighbors we will have to look at all n entries in the row to determine which of these n entries are the actual neighbors	dev
audio_0_17857.wav	So, let me clear it let it move little bit up	dev
audio_0_181596.wav	So, control multiplex a lot of control into one physical channel the traffic each user gets a dedicated traffic channel	dev
audio_0_190718.wav	So, let me quickly solve this problem	dev
audio_0_98168.wav	So, both of these become viable	dev
audio_0_134377.wav	Look at this very example and interesting example where you find small child 14 month old child playing with a python	dev
audio_0_56140.wav	later on i may be having another set of s and t points which we may want to interconnect	dev
audio_0_171322.wav	So one is say f1 t which have a period between 0 to t	dev
audio_0_89006.wav	So the challenge in the Arbiter PUF is that the select line of the multiplexers so for example over here considering that there are 3 switches, the challenge is 0, 0 and 1	dev
audio_0_205697.wav	So, that isometric length thing comes faster cos 30 here; the true length factor comes at 45	dev
audio_0_159601.wav	It is a logical unit of a program	dev
audio_0_94985.wav	when you cast a glance at your audience, you can find that if they are unable to understand or unable to listen, you will find some scratches on their face, provided you are a very good face reader	dev
audio_0_230523.wav	Three attributes, namely magnitude of current, resistivity of the current and the rate at which the heat is dissipated governs the temperature for a given wire through the electric current flows	dev
audio_0_164352.wav	Now here Z is a quantity which is called impedance	dev
audio_0_235167.wav	You let them know, what you can control	dev
audio_0_10073.wav	866 ampere and I c is equal to 200 by 400	dev
audio_0_239026.wav	And, the bonuses are decided, on the basis of, what the employee has been able to achieve	dev
audio_0_94364.wav	moreover, it also, ah expresses a lot of things about people	dev
audio_0_189873.wav	So, these are nice rings which cover most of the interesting examples that we have studied in this course and which this property that we want to define is very important	dev
audio_0_178060.wav	The; or you can think of it as average path loss average signal power is corresponds to average path loss as well	dev
audio_0_115907.wav	so mobile communication issues, that is, low bandwidth, one of the biggest issue because of the radio resource of the wireless network is much more scarce than the wired networks	dev
audio_0_220872.wav	So, so here in this picture, right, these two things are drawn in different colors	dev
audio_0_202203.wav	So, go to features, select these two things by control object	dev
audio_0_29962.wav	And things which goes well then we say that you are able to control and things were you realize that you are not able to control, you think that ok	dev
audio_0_1465.wav	And this is that commutator segment right and this is called riser or lug and this is a segment and they are all insulated separated from each other by mica say	dev
audio_0_185641.wav	A function accepts input arguments and produces the output by executing valid R commands that are inside the function	dev
audio_0_19291.wav	Now classification as per variability is mainly useful for decision making purposes	dev
audio_0_220894.wav	Now, I do one more swap	dev
audio_0_96963.wav	So, in this example, again on the left hand side, we have the same malloc example with the free	dev
audio_0_227406.wav	4 by 300 which is equal to 0	dev
audio_0_73598.wav	It tends to be more time consuming	dev
audio_0_170484.wav	So voltage across terminal a b is V and current flowing into the load from the external circuit is current I	dev
audio_0_200576.wav	But the important thing is that it is assumed to be a constant regardless of the value of current	dev
audio_0_43627.wav	Normal right; it is purely normal there is no tangential component ok	dev
audio_0_11750.wav	So, all these expression whatever I have written here V Cos alpha you put v small V and js your sin alpha	dev
audio_0_147120.wav	Now, once you have both the software, you first install virtual box; it is very easy to install virtual box on any platform	dev
audio_0_133558.wav	So, certain doable aspects, certain non doable aspects, you have not used it yourself, but you have seen that others who use slangs were punished	dev
audio_0_237921.wav	Step two is, setting goals and timetables	dev
audio_0_43664.wav	So, this all gets taken care of under local to global conventions right	dev
audio_0_21867.wav	they will say, no, i just hate because i do not like them	dev
audio_0_110056.wav	So, there are lot of electromagnetic waves that come out from them and you require microwave technology to understand them like, for example, we see an application here	dev
audio_0_235080.wav	And, the government, matches a percentage of it	dev
audio_0_57539.wav	this is having a delay of two	dev
audio_0_103906.wav	So, if you go through this code, you will able to see that this pointer is actually carrying the address	dev
audio_0_231392.wav	So, that is indicated by your tendency to procrastinate	dev
audio_0_45017.wav	The error is passed on to the PID controller and the output of the PID controller corresponds to the D hat, corresponds to the deviation in the duty cycle, a voltage corresponding to that	dev
audio_0_17493.wav	So, I suggest once again when we because later stage we will solve any problem is another thing	dev
audio_0_72803.wav	In the waterfall model, everything needs to be documented	dev
audio_0_86096.wav	Now stack check fail is a built in function which essentially would print out this particular output which tells you the exact information about where the stack smashing was detected and so on	dev
audio_0_191745.wav	So, let me now continue and prove the next important proposition	dev
audio_0_21498.wav	It is a coordinated effort where the resources are coordinated and allocated to different functions and the end result is a master budget	dev
audio_0_158524.wav	Now first of all we must understand why there can be different ways of evaluating a query	dev
audio_0_23931.wav	Like in school there is always books, you have a particular book that is different scenario	dev
audio_0_222660.wav	So, we will see these algorithms in detail in a later lecture	dev
audio_0_202652.wav	So, in lecture 7 onwards we cover these conic sections and geometrical constructions	dev
audio_0_114842.wav	he ah his work will be describing, but we will be looking at more broader aspects that how things should be there	dev
audio_0_59147.wav	i mean they are becoming thinner and as they are becoming thinner, the the impact of the resistive and other effects are increasing	dev
audio_0_60403.wav	suppose i have a four input nand gate	dev
audio_0_94760.wav	now, through this, you are justifying your claims for the position you have applied	dev
audio_0_145304.wav	On the other hand in an event driven scheduler, the scheduler does not become active based on a clock interrupt but it is based on certain events	dev
audio_0_184013.wav	So, that you know if I were you are reading the CDMA 2000 you will actually a appreciate the information	dev
audio_0_59566.wav	then similarly, we have z, again with two	dev
audio_0_40954.wav	So, basically what is the current and voltage at the input terminals that is the impedance right	dev
audio_0_26869.wav	And the typical thing we would do is for every key in d dot keys do something with d square bracket k	dev
audio_0_156132.wav	Now if you notice this matrix is symmetric as it should be because it doesn't matter which transaction is on the row and which transaction is in the column	dev
audio_0_235672.wav	Beyond which, you know, if given a chance to take a vacation	dev
audio_0_169476.wav	Now, next is how much complex power is being supplied	dev
audio_0_76721.wav	So, in this particular case I have drawn these 3 As and 2 Bs	dev
audio_0_3632.wav	So, this 1 or 2 things I am leaving up to you just to see whether whether you can answer correctly or not you just put the answer in the forum	dev
audio_0_75189.wav	What is done in this approach is you collect the cell lysate and incubate with beads which are coated with antibody against a lysate	dev
audio_0_144040.wav	What are the important factors for estimation	dev
audio_0_21541.wav	So, for 5,500 units into 12 and into 10	dev
audio_0_41501.wav	But let us keep it simple let us just think about total field formulation for now ok	dev
audio_0_187981.wav	So, the first level of model assessment is done using the R squared value	dev
audio_0_40294.wav	So, that is my f into A dot ds right that I use the divergence theorem ok	dev
audio_0_233913.wav	We assess the company	dev
audio_0_181655.wav	And the next unit of study is on understanding the capacity of a channel	dev
audio_0_235345.wav	What one considers as right and wrong, and the most appropriate ways of dealing, with one's work	dev
audio_0_76575.wav	So, you have a laser which focuses at this point	dev
audio_0_223387.wav	So, we may have more than one candidate for the longest common subword, but our main pure goal at the moment is to compute not the subword itself, but the length, we will see how we can recover this subword quit easily from the length calculation	dev
audio_0_195652.wav	This is in volts, this is in micro amperors	dev
audio_0_194180.wav	So, suppose I is prime; so, in this direction suppose I is prime	dev
audio_0_130614.wav	and do we have a magnetic field	dev
audio_0_9476.wav	And the voltage v t shown in figure 5 this 6 b	dev
audio_0_77021.wav	Let us see you have made a protein which has this unit repeating A A A A so on and so forth	dev
audio_0_223270.wav	Let us take another look at greedy algorithms	dev
audio_0_201601.wav	Whenever you have available long dimensions, we show it like over that	dev
audio_0_186383.wav	You can use this function Set working directory and give the path of the directory which u want to be the working directory for r studio, in the double codes	dev
audio_0_117156.wav	so the fact the cell phone cannot perform all the task which is needed, right, that we see that the cell phone cannot perform	dev
audio_0_98898.wav	So, if we do this then a certainly the problems get solved, we can now go and write the same code you will find that you are getting the desired effect	dev
audio_0_224993.wav	So, we have n nodes the height is order log n	dev
audio_0_49696.wav	this tube is made of aluminum and this tube is made of copper, so that i have these tubes made of material of different conductivity	dev
audio_0_2605.wav	So, consider a cylindrical rotor machine with both the stator and rotor wound for 3 phase as shown in figure right	dev
audio_0_21169.wav	It involves recording, estimating, controlling and reporting of costs	dev
audio_0_188265.wav	So, the balance accuracy is again sensitivity plus speci city by 2 which is 2 by 2, it is it is 1	dev
audio_0_228832.wav	First of all, we have number of defective pieces and the period	dev
audio_0_81682.wav	The blue one is 15 and this one so, peak to peak is 20, alright	dev
audio_0_96235.wav	that is why let us see a sample memo	dev
audio_0_207328.wav	Now, I would like to use one more line to join like a triangle, then I will pick that one and click that one	dev
audio_0_205656.wav	That is the first thing for isometric view	dev
audio_0_239602.wav	But, definitely stay in touch, with the concerned employee	dev
audio_0_229698.wav	So, that is why it is said as cost effective approach for reducing the overall variation and thus improving the quality of an assembled product	dev
audio_0_217786.wav	this should somehow show up as efficiency numbers	dev
audio_0_70768.wav	On the other hand, an organization may have a slightly different project management standard as compared to the of the self standard	dev
audio_0_62428.wav	lets take ah circuit consisting of three gates	dev
audio_0_58081.wav	and the first one is, of course swap to adjacent operand	dev
audio_0_120104.wav	right, so	dev
audio_0_26143.wav	In backtracking we systematically search for a solution one step at a time and when we hit a dead end we undo the last step and try the next option	dev
audio_0_43108.wav	So, we will see what these are as we as we go along	dev
audio_0_51168.wav	the point in vector is given as one over mu zero, e cross b, and we all ready seen that e cross b is in the direction of propagation	dev
audio_0_79738.wav	So, membrane pushes the filament in opposite direction	dev
audio_0_131197.wav	so what we will do is so	dev
audio_0_130567.wav	then only this much amount of heat we are adding in the combustion chamber, or rather from an external source	dev
audio_0_185390.wav	So, the completely fair scheduler or the CFS scheduler is the default scheduler used in Linux kernels in the latest versions	dev
audio_0_194671.wav	So it does behave like a current buffer	dev
audio_0_4397.wav	So, and the another thing is that that that we have to come from 0 to t right from 0 to T you have to come	dev
audio_0_198741.wav	And we have our signal source, because of lack of space I will show it up here	dev
audio_0_192615.wav	That is simply the intersection	dev
audio_0_219742.wav	So, this is the number of the counter before the DFS of i actually started, and then I increment the count	dev
audio_0_121361.wav	Again, this particular statement is slightly ironical again because they are cowards in some sense because they do not have the courage to go and meet the messenger, they do not have the courage to go to the battlefield, they do not have the courage to organize troops who could fight against the English East India Company, but they are also not cowards because they can draw their swords and fight against one another	dev
audio_0_178815.wav	Selection combining the simplest of the methods MRC the best equal gain combining which will give you most of the benefit and is equal to the optimal combining if the SNR if the noise variances are all the same	dev
audio_0_178809.wav	And if you remember for the case that M equal to 2 we actually did compute the expected value of gamma EGC for the co phasing, for the 2 branch co phasing, we showed that this is equal to gamma into 1 plus pi by 4	dev
audio_0_206352.wav	So, front view is the central one	dev
audio_0_61004.wav	ok, so, generally speaking, as i had said, two d compaction gives better result as compared to one d compaction, and if you can solve it optimally, which unfortunately is not possible because it is amphered, it can produce minimum area layout	dev
audio_0_174494.wav	Recognize the need for and have the preparation and ability to engage in a independent and life long learning LLL as we call it in the broadest context of technological change	dev
audio_0_8292.wav	So, that is why this is written as V s u t	dev
audio_0_183805.wav	Now, if you knew what the feedback tabs where	dev
audio_0_8673.wav	high volt because, short circuit test it require very low voltage right	dev
audio_0_100460.wav	There is a function which takes a call, takes a parameter by reference and returns that same parameter by reference	dev
audio_0_198508.wav	We connect a signal source to port one of this incremental equivalent and a load to port two of this incremental equivalent and evaluate the gain	dev
audio_0_117222.wav	so this is a very complex question	dev
audio_0_77354.wav	However, if you look at biomaterials or biopolymer networks in many cases instead of this linear elasticity, stress versus strain is straight line; that means E is constant right	dev
audio_0_170548.wav	Now it often occurs that the RTh which you calculate will become negative	dev
audio_0_147698.wav	If you notice that the labels are not visible, you can change the color pallet	dev
audio_0_117357.wav	so ah um ah, it takes different ah ah, different um available experie experience values, that is, availability experienced by the particular vm, bandwidth experienced by a particular vm or a particular ti time, then the what are the different promise for different vms by a particular provider and so and so forth, and generate that sla satisfaction for a particular vm i on availability, sla satisfaction of a particular vm i on ah um bandwidth and so and so ah things	dev
audio_0_104436.wav	If I do that using a pointer I get the same thing doing it with a pointer	dev
audio_0_151185.wav	We can probably connect this to the quiz that we have or homework that we have for the course also	dev
audio_0_141148.wav	Second case, irrespective of the cultural back ground from where you are okay, might be that you have seen that largely the winners okay, in one situation, in one profession they express themselves the same way, so every time when you win Miss World competition okay, irrespective of the cultural back ground, irrespective of the difference in the SRG that name was talking about, we express ourselves the same way okay	test
audio_0_184011.wav	Now what happens if you want to do traffic, that is the last one	test
audio_0_43317.wav	So, this is my ok now x is my set of unknowns which is the tangential component along the triangle we have seen that the U i’s right	test
audio_0_133230.wav	Now, look at the activation pattern and compare it in terms of the increase versus of decrease situation	test
audio_0_422.wav	So, we will get E b is equal to V minus I a into R S plus r a; R S is the series field resistance	test
audio_0_110134.wav	So, that you will have to be apply into your design whereas, if you see the right side thing that typically in a non RF system like from this antenna finally, this after this IF amplifier it comes to finally, a demodulator sort of thing	test
audio_0_158498.wav	So the first locating block using the index is located and then everything from the index is being searched	test
audio_0_239612.wav	Please do not inflict punishment, on any employee, without giving them, enough number of warnings, recorded warnings, and opportunities to succeed	test
audio_0_151402.wav	Let me walk you through little bit about what these are, and then show you some data and try to finds some results with the data that was collected, so nature of content and topics that characterize social media discussion threads	test
audio_0_105593.wav	This is now over written from the definition that you had used in the mobile phone, you are not changing the interface any more, but you will certainly have a different implementation and all of these additional functions are certainly inherited	test
audio_0_48588.wav	So, what basically it means is particularly, because you may have seen it in your 12th grade book, if light rays are going away from each other, we say light rays are diverging, if people have differing views we will say they have divergent views	test
audio_0_220188.wav	One containing each vertex and now we need to add the current edge we are looking at, provided it does not create a cycle	test
audio_0_129172.wav	so this is a series rlc circuit	test
audio_0_98063.wav	so, if you look at here, if you use steps in resolutions, first you form the candidate function	test
audio_0_32656.wav	Why minus pi	test
audio_0_63084.wav	you see, this whole design process can be divided broadly into two parts	test
audio_0_235898.wav	The assessment phase, includes organizational assessment	test
audio_0_94470.wav	when we communicate, we communicate some experience, say, for example, we can communicate through different ways, though communication can be considered effective only when it had met its desired goal	test
audio_0_138307.wav	For example, this is, this is, you know a typical solenoid valve, so you directly can drive current into a, into a solenoid valve which will pull the spool	test
audio_0_57658.wav	similarly, here there are several repeaters i have inserted	test
audio_0_42739.wav	So, this thing is called a magnetic frill right	test
audio_0_61055.wav	because there is a path, you are able to see it	test
audio_0_160590.wav	So in a row based storage, what is being done is that this is stored, then this is stored, then this is stored, then this is stored, then this is stored, then this is stored	test
audio_0_74806.wav	So, they did experiments where they perturbed actin in two ways	test
audio_0_8101.wav	So, v 2 later we find out basically we have to see the how many nodes are there basically we have 3 node; one is here first we look into this one is here and another is here v 3, another is the v 4 all these things we apply KCL right	test
audio_0_183798.wav	Now, this we know is another shifted sequence of the same of the length	test
audio_0_26730.wav	Otherwise, we compute a new value for this combination, store it and then return it	test
audio_0_236167.wav	And, look for a rationale, for the decisions, that people make	test
audio_0_4981.wav	44 degree	test
audio_0_224623.wav	So, what we do is we initially assume that the maximum value is the first value and then we scan the rest of the array and wherever we see a value which is bigger than the current maximum value, maxval we replace it	test
audio_0_194929.wav	that could be chosen	test
audio_0_173099.wav	2 months in the sense not full time activity but they do over a period of 2 months but as a group interacting	test
audio_0_116299.wav	so one is that more devices connected to the base [net/station] station and mobile user requires the information, are transmitted to the central possessing and are collected by the server providing those things	test
audio_0_174588.wav	That means there could be a quiz or a question that involves Criteria and Specifications or Practical Constraints	test
audio_0_211679.wav	the principal, if the application indeed is about motion detection, is about motion detection, which we just said p i r can do, then i would use a p i r sensor and i just simply detect a motion one, no motion zero, presence one and no presence of human zero	test
audio_0_28856.wav	We solve if a i a 0 is not b 0 we solved both these problems a 1 to a m minus 1 b 0 and a 0 to a m minus 1 b 1 solve of them take the maximum one whichever one is better it is the one	test
audio_0_214845.wav	power was not really the issue here, with either one m b p s, with either classic bluetooth or enhanced data rate systems	test
audio_0_222055.wav	So, it is useful to say for each call that I am sorting from some left limit to some right limit	test
audio_0_77321.wav	So, if I take the slope this slope is either this slope is less than this slope	test
audio_0_116281.wav	right, you have partitioned the things: runtime and this split execution	test
audio_0_35070.wav	So, this is where right so basis function a is like this, basis function b is like this	test
audio_0_94646.wav	again, if you are, say, applying for a job in management, you can mention a marketing position with an opportunity for eventual managerial status	test
audio_0_87090.wav	So for example some operations say a load instruction or a store instruction would take considerably more power compared to other instructions such as a simple move or an addition and so on	test
audio_0_67052.wav	So, this is how you analyse a substrate that what all different elements which are presenting on a substrate and this is one powerful tool which help chemist, biochemist, material scientist everybody to understand the surface chemistry	test
audio_0_62438.wav	and third, one is e, stuck at one, so input is zero, one, output will be one	test
audio_0_59049.wav	so two to the power n possible inputs coupled to two to the power s possible states	test
audio_0_225339.wav	So, basically now I will end up having a flat tree along this path, this path it use is look like this it not been flattened out like this	test
audio_0_122110.wav	So, it's more vital in relation to Ravatha's context	test
audio_0_152025.wav	So, this basically shows that the users are also co located very closely, within 75 percent have their distance less than 40 miles	test
audio_0_233999.wav	If yes, if it occurred, what did you see	test
audio_0_208970.wav	That ellipse entirely we are going to rotate it in that direction	test
audio_0_208838.wav	So, let us look at the drawing sheet this will be 19 mm	test
audio_0_235687.wav	Keep learning	test
audio_0_106151.wav	In a sell deed typically, you would find towards the end of the sale deed, a portion of the sale deed what we call the schedule	test
audio_0_23882.wav	Actually the thing is like whenever I have something in my mind, I used to write it	test
audio_0_209270.wav	It help us to really visualize that object	test
audio_0_237815.wav	Disparate treatment refers to, direct discrimination	test
audio_0_116259.wav	so if we look at the um runtime offloading, there are different ah tricky issues, right, or factors like a dynamic runtime offloading involves the issues of dynamic application profiling and solver on smd right, runtime application partitioning	test
audio_0_207919.wav	Observe that arrows are pointing in that direction and there is a dash small dashed lines; so, a very long dash followed by two small dashed lines goes all the way	test
audio_0_102443.wav	So, here along with the pointer, we will always use the address of as well as content of operators	test
audio_0_63086.wav	so we shall be assuming that we already have a circuit net list available to us and from their we shall be carrying on this steps of floor planning, placement, routing and the other analysis steps	test
audio_0_193175.wav	So, you have two polynomial you have a polynomial g when you go modulo p the constant term disappears, right because phi p g is equal to b i X i and also I should say I is positive j is positive because this is a factorization that comes from the rational polynomials	test
audio_0_113823.wav	So, this we can enforce second term can be forced to 0; that means, we can force x s is equal to minus x l source reactance is equal to negative of load that we will make it minimum	test
audio_0_61206.wav	i can take from d two, d two, d three are all of them together, and output of the shift register is fed as the input to the first flip flop	test
audio_0_104504.wav	There is one virtual function f and one virtual function g	test
audio_0_78799.wav	So, you can imagine a pushing force being exerted	test
audio_0_228879.wav	So, I have got this; this is my proportion defective chart or P chart, ok	test
audio_0_15230.wav	So, 500 upon 750 into phi 1 by phi 2 that is 2 phi 1 upon 3 phi 2, this is equation 3 right	test
audio_0_190511.wav	So, I am going to just illustrate	test
audio_0_87757.wav	Therefore, the content of the stack is relatively small and if we keep adding gadgets onto this stack, the stack may quite easily overflow and thing not work, so it is quite tricky way to choose gadgets and place gadgets in such a way so that the required payload gets executed	test
audio_0_64201.wav	ok, so for large designs it may not be practically visible to go for this kind of full custom design	test
audio_0_93574.wav	somebody might have the plan to become the incharge of the training and placement cell	test
audio_0_20290.wav	Of course from environmental angle the water remains very, very important	test

audio_0_207412.wav	Smart dimension, pick that	test
audio_0_78616.wav	This is counter to what most people think that that chemical factors are all that that regulates stem cell fate	test
audio_0_198851.wav	GDS is maximum when VDS is zero, that is the transistor has no voltage across it	test
audio_0_82544.wav	When there is no channel, if I want to attract electron; I have to apply positive gate that is why gate is positive; that means, when I increase V G S my current will start increasing	test
audio_0_31470.wav	That is heterogeneous or homogeneous	test
audio_0_67830.wav	But one has to do that division stopping that division is essential, but in a very controlled way so that you can achieve your goal of seeing the myelination happening as well as seeing the nodes of Ranvier formation and their electrical properties they regain it	test
audio_0_217044.wav	this is something that people have been, i mean, exploring for a long time now	test
audio_0_83693.wav	So, it is also proportional to Vc and the gain with which it amplifies this V c is called common mode gain	test
audio_0_26317.wav	Here is our earlier definition of Pythagoras, where we had x, y, and z unconstrained	test
audio_0_44548.wav	The output portion of the forward converter is like the buck converter and therefore the inductor current, the capacitor current and the output load current parts of the waveforms will be exactly same as that of the buck equivalent buck converter waveforms that we discussed	test
audio_0_18560.wav	Because, Z is not in what you call phasor quantity	test
audio_0_104557.wav	Then your dynamic cast operator gives you the same value of the pointer as of the base class pointer, because certainly the address of the object cannot change	test
audio_0_174694.wav	For example when you come here, design this VCVS, CCVS and so on voltage and SMPS voltage regulators we are now talking a PO3, PO4, PO5 and these are PO3 is related to conducting investigations about complex problems	test
audio_0_174059.wav	What it means is, all activities that we plan should somehow be of interest to the learner	test
audio_0_188849.wav	So, it looks like this, this is a good candidate for an optimum point	test
audio_0_48579.wav	But, we are fortunate there is a theorem and I am going to say without proving it the theorem called Helmholtz's theorem	test
audio_0_94437.wav	sometimes it so happens ah that people ah run sort of ideas and before time they ah feel like finishing it, meaning thereby they did not have much to say	test
audio_0_212060.wav	the first one she has in her hand is a golf ball lens	test
audio_0_132228.wav	so there should be some other method where the life is little bit simple	test
audio_0_51678.wav	now this, the, this equation of four, unknowns four equation	test
audio_0_166432.wav	So, basically we have two ways to process the information and a find finding out the output response	test
audio_0_102770.wav	Now certainly that option does not exist, because we do not have, we cannot write a constructor for int, it is a built in type	test
audio_0_180595.wav	So, this is where the problem happens with the Rayleigh distribution	test
audio_0_151304.wav	63, 62	test
audio_0_237665.wav	So, that is a very difficult thing, that we all deal with, as HR managers	test
audio_0_75970.wav	The cells, epithelial cells form these acini structures, they form this acini structures, but in case of stiff surfaces order 5,000 pascals what she found was you have these aggregate of cells which exhibit a very invasive phenotype, these are also to the acini structure falls	test
audio_0_160619.wav	So just single updates are being done or some small part of very very small part of the database is updated	test
audio_0_5445.wav	So, X L is equal to this is my Z plot, this is my Z plot right	test
audio_0_122927.wav	So, we need to remember one thing that certain groups are clubbed together	test
audio_0_233730.wav	The next part is, explain the whole job, and related to some job, the worker has already done, or some job that, the worker already knows	test

audio_0_175556.wav	A student should grow all the time with the, with understanding what specifications are and when you chose a specification what does it mean	test
audio_0_92820.wav	But if f is a conservative vector field, then this line integral will not depend on the path, this is what we have seen here because the value of this line integral if your F is conservative is simply fb minus fa and this is small f is the scalar function corresponding to this F so, that is F is equal to gradient of this scalar function f that means, what we get out of this, that this integral from the point a to b in that domain is equal to the f evaluated at the point b minus f has to evaluated at the point a	test
audio_0_219910.wav	When that line actually leaves the region, at that corner vertex where the trapezium turns bends down, we find that we can get 1 lakh 90,000 and it turns out that this is actually going to be the optimum value	test
audio_0_54285.wav	if curl of d was zero and it was known, it becomes like a problem of calculating electric field	test
audio_0_234664.wav	And, all of course, depends on the organization	test
audio_0_52883.wav	now i know b inside is zero and this should be equal to b applied plus b induced due to whatever m is, since b applied is uniform	test
audio_0_93001.wav	And when x is not equal to 0, we can differentiate this there is no issue, you can directly differentiate	test
audio_0_32998.wav	We followed this approach where we use the divergence theorem to convert it	test

audio_0_232600.wav	So, they will be able to survive and if you look at the lifespan of human beings in general, human beings arrived late to the planet Earth and will leave it very soon	test
audio_0_41997.wav	So, this is going to be like this	test
audio_0_193385.wav	So, that is now generalized to an arbitrary ring situation and we use a notation this is convenient instead of writing in words b divides a, we write b divides a to indicate that we write b vertical bar a this implies this is a shorthand for the statement b divides a that I will use often or that b is a proper b is a divisor of a	test
audio_0_95624.wav	for that you require a secondary ah method, and the secondary method can be library	test
audio_0_32834.wav	So, x is decreasing over here right	test
audio_0_115441.wav	so there can be attack on authenticity, right, i, i pretend, or intrude, are, pretend to be the sources, right, so on	test
audio_0_134144.wav	The bright yellow light represents movement of signal across the brain	test
audio_0_79329.wav	, this is the Clare Waterman paper published in Nature 2010 and the other paper Patla et al	test
audio_0_36847.wav	Direction is reversed	test
audio_0_81489.wav	So, always remember when you talk about inverting amplifier, apply the input to inverting talk about the non inverting amplifier apply input to non inverting terminal	test
audio_0_61869.wav	so delta, the change can be twice v d d, because this is changing plus v d d	test
audio_0_172098.wav	Now, let us talk about another theorem, which is called as a compensation theorem	test
audio_0_77032.wav	What might be another possibility; the protein is super stable and requires high forces to unfold	test
audio_0_80865.wav	So, I will catch you in the next class in the next particular module and then we will see how the op amp circuits can be used as a band pass filter till then take care, bye	test
audio_0_100380.wav	We have discussed about copy assignment operator which is doing a copy when the object already existing	test
audio_0_193980.wav	Remember A and B are just sets	test
audio_0_33236.wav	So, I will just the set of true equation which are not helpful ok	test
audio_0_101057.wav	3, since there are two data members the state is defined in terms of doublet, in terms of a pair of numbers here	test
audio_0_228362.wav	Then we the circle 2, ok, circle 3, circle 4, circle 5; all the circles the coordinates of the circles which, ok	test
audio_0_219256.wav	Now, can it be that there was a path from y to w to v which is shorter than a path we claimed just now via x to v	test
audio_0_184791.wav	The instantaneous SNR gamma k can be written as mod Z k whole square that is the amplitude square of the channel gain, times E s by N naught what a nominal SNR multiplied by mod Z k square	test
audio_0_34151.wav	So, these in this right top view diagram over here these are sort of we can imagine four nearest I mean in one Yee cell all the four values are involved in calculating H at a future time instance right	test
audio_0_78513.wav	Now, let us say that we draw the outline of a cell under some condition if you see	test
audio_0_94938.wav	you are not going to clutter everything by writing everything on these slides, otherwise people wont like it	test
audio_0_94706.wav	when it comes to references, as i said in the previous lecture, it is better not to mention the name of referees unless and until asked for	test
audio_0_117409.wav	but we did ah some experimentation on the saas or some simulation on the saas marketplace	test
audio_0_230409.wav	So, here what we do is we try to take 45 degrees, right	test
audio_0_91673.wav	And immediately when we substitute x is equal to x naught so, this polynomial has to give the value f x naught an equal to b naught and this term will be 0 so, the b naught we will get as f x naught and then we can go for the other point which is x 1	test
audio_0_59370.wav	so you see that how far they are the points you want to connect for the any combination of these	test
audio_0_21449.wav	Of course, we have to consider whether there is enough demand for Y because now we are zooming up the sales of Y, there should be demand for it	test
audio_0_195878.wav	So how do we accomplish this	test
audio_0_88453.wav	So, one thing for you to think about is about the command line arguments, so as we know the main function actually takes a two parameters, one is an arg C and an arg V	test
audio_0_165794.wav	So k will become M is 2	test
audio_0_28502.wav	Therefore, a given point is given some coordinate like a comma b	test
audio_0_31350.wav	k r	test
audio_0_36062.wav	So, first a bit of notation so, if I set e x is equal to h x, e y is equal to h y, and e z is equal to h z, this is called a matched medium it just terminology, having pose the problem in a very general way now, I begin to see where do I want to get to ok	test
audio_0_159832.wav	Now why are these rules important because you see that these are going to produce much faster joins these are going to be smaller relations and in the expression trees that we saw this was exactly what being done	test
audio_0_57084.wav	ok, so here we are defining radius and cost	test
audio_0_225203.wav	So, we must take the bigger of the two and move it up, because among these three the biggest value must be at the top that is the definition of the max heap property, so we exchange the 11 and the 24	test
audio_0_102782.wav	The reinterpret cast operator can convert pointer of any type to pointer of another type, even of the unrelated classes	test
audio_0_191275.wav	So, this is not an integral domain and I will quickly tell you why the previous argument fails here	test
audio_0_208784.wav	Once it is done mark these points, P5, P6, P7 and P8 is always be at A	test
audio_0_166474.wav	So this would be nothing but the unit impulse response of the circuit	test
audio_0_157183.wav	So this is repeatedly chosen as a victim	test
audio_0_240041.wav	But, where do you draw the line	test
audio_0_134444.wav	Mostly you will always find in the clinical set up	test
audio_0_145548.wav	The deadline is the same as the period	test
audio_0_57806.wav	so this is equivalent to this	test
audio_0_223233.wav	So, a typical example of this is the recursive solution to finding the nth Fibonacci number	test
audio_0_152492.wav	What I would like to actually leave this part of the lecture is actually I would like the students who are part of this course to actually point out different types of privacy issues on the forum	test
audio_0_169581.wav	So, before going into this particular topic today, let me give you one good historical event example	test
audio_0_38544.wav	So, the input impedance that you have calculated for a single antenna in free space you were very happy about it, you put it into an electromagnetic environment where there are various objects and suddenly you find that your you know your performance is not so good right	test
audio_0_13523.wav	So, this way suppose this sinusoidal waveform voltage and current both are generated, but angle between these 2 are remain same	test
audio_0_173255.wav	People may disagree with that	test
audio_0_41190.wav	So, right now real life objects will they always be homogenous; obviously not right think of your things that your calculating the RCS of some you know aircraft over here right this is some aircraft there is some cockpit over here	test
audio_0_40310.wav	Here what has happened is I have changed it to I have taken I do not have to take any derivative of A; A is by itself	test
audio_0_205388.wav	Similarly, at bottom also we have that kind of material	test
audio_0_212781.wav	again, note that we are modifying mosquitto dot conf	test
audio_0_149950.wav	So, therefore, when mayorships are high there is going to be tips and dones also which are high	test
audio_0_184638.wav	That will be that will be equal to 1 divided by expected value of 1 over gamma	test
audio_0_115729.wav	i, whether i am having money or ah having ah um more space, etcetera, but whether that can be supplied	test
audio_0_134328.wav	So, what actually happens to your body, what happens in the normal nervous system whether it is central or autonomic or what happens in the face, what happens to your voice	test
audio_0_77794.wav	And when the activated YAP this led to dropped EC proliferation increase significantly	test
audio_0_219469.wav	So, we have 28 characters, we can count that there are 28 characters which have been inserted including spaces and other, 18 characters have been deleted and 2 characters have been substituted	test
audio_0_113698.wav	So, you see that due to those various impedance levels; when the power is getting flowed to the load	test
audio_0_209473.wav	But these are the popular softwares used at industry level	test
audio_0_83157.wav	If you just write under root or just under root like this and then write x, y, z value that is consider that it is equivalent to x, y, z all right	test
audio_0_62834.wav	ah means in practice they are sometimes called scalable	test
audio_0_186310.wav	Now let us move on to the for loop the structure of for loop construct comprises of a sequence which could be a vector or a list an iter which is an element of the sequence and the statements that are needed to be executed	test
audio_0_135184.wav	So, for the first to 10 item, we will be having this score	test
audio_0_132520.wav	in this case, however, both the fluids are water and, as we will see, it uses a two stage compression, and i am showing, going to show you a schematic over here as to how it works	test
audio_0_34722.wav	And a surface integral over it, so that is like which theorem	test
audio_0_100918.wav	Then it is a which has Partha because I had explicitly deduct strdup of this string into the new object string, but because I did not provide a copy constructor, the bit patterns have got copied	test
audio_0_55757.wav	first is that most of the circuits that we use today there are based on edge trigged operation	test
audio_0_147501.wav	And of course, one could do some heat map, one could find out where are the places from where majority of the posts are coming and you could use that for making some decisions	test
audio_0_44170.wav	It is the case where I do not know the analytical integral of an equation ok, that is the first thing	test
audio_0_201541.wav	Here, with respect to this reference line, we are showing it as 2	test
audio_0_65795.wav	The reason being because this is something which is kind of you wanted to you know, do it very cleanly you do not to mess up things here	test
audio_0_183829.wav	Now in a multipath environment I am the base station your transmitting let us say 3 of you, have got one shifted version original sequence 1 shift 2 shifts	test
audio_0_95277.wav	sometimes they also start this coupon system	test
audio_0_11720.wav	So, V C will be greater than V L look at that V C is 90 volt and V C is 40 volt	test
audio_0_16460.wav	So, it will be P G will be 60 minus 1 59 kilo watt and slip is 0	test
audio_0_202728.wav	Now, we have to project that so, our point b comes to this location	test
audio_0_162851.wav	So, now you see I can easily tell that what is my physical area	test
audio_0_79967.wav	fc or f L, right	test
audio_0_180811.wav	Increase transmit power Increase transmit power if you cannot do that I have to add more sites which means cost	test
audio_0_115812.wav	so when load increases, so we can have ah, some sort of wakeup call, right, wake up on land sort of things to start the waiting node	test
audio_0_228203.wav	So, we will not work on this, the software here is Tangram, have the indicator here, indicator would blink and when this will touch and also a beep voice would come	test
audio_0_95743.wav	moreover, if you want to have a particular person for ah observation as a method of data collection, maybe he is not available also	test
audio_0_154544.wav	In this figure four leg clamp situations, we find that both hands are clamped on the leg and one leg is resting horizontally over the other	test
audio_0_66602.wav	now, having said this, this is not a such an easy technology	test
audio_0_75715.wav	So, first you have protrusion then you have adhesion	test
audio_0_180588.wav	So, basically you will not get a single cdf, but you will get a family of cdfs for the different values of K	test
audio_0_135412.wav	And in long term of course we devoted too much of time to understand different formats of long term storage	test
audio_0_149956.wav	So, 79,000 cities have higher check ins, have mayorships in the figure 3 in the total data	test
audio_0_110980.wav	Distance I can always tell that in terms of wavelength suppose I am moving a 4	test
audio_0_132050.wav	we are sending it to a steam turbine power plant	test
audio_0_219661.wav	So, this time we are starting at 4	test
audio_0_21624.wav	You can take the total for all the three months that is the quarter 59 and the total is 2	test
audio_0_156455.wav	So that is not a desirable situation and this is why this multivalued dependency is useful	test
audio_0_232875.wav	Equal employment opportunity and non discrimination	test
audio_0_172702.wav	In this whole process it should be remembered there is nothing like a, the only way to do things	test
audio_0_174065.wav	That itself can sometimes can be motivating to students	test
audio_0_188456.wav	So, both the equations became consistent and I could drop one equation ; however, if this number was anything other than 10 then what it basically means is, that while the left hand side will be linearly dependent where the second equation will be twice the first equation the right hand side will always be inconsistent	test
audio_0_167095.wav	You will represent this particular equation in the form of block diagram as Xs is the input to the block	test
audio_0_39082.wav	I do not know right, I gave you a wire all I told you whether it is connected to a constant voltage source	test
audio_0_233642.wav	Over learning, could be harmful	test
audio_0_101229.wav	So, in call by reference the actual parameter and the formal parameter will have different names in the caller and the callee, but they will have the same memory location	test
audio_0_82398.wav	Now, if I apply positive with respect to the substrate	test
audio_0_237635.wav	This is not a legal requirement	test
audio_0_207376.wav	Now, you would like to have give something like 75 millimeters	test
audio_0_137180.wav	So, but so, whatever saying is that you can still operate a plant around an unstable operating point using negative feedback, basically that is what your feedback control achieves	test
audio_0_226686.wav	So, we saw very clearly there is a primary device, then we had an intermediate device; intermediate we had and then we had the final or secondary device or final	test
audio_0_133709.wav	Learning basically is relatively stable change relatively permanent change in the behavior which is basically a byproduct of experience, fine	test
audio_0_18243.wav	So, that is why it will be C 1 into dv by dt plus C 2 into dv by dt up to C N into dv by dt or you take	test
audio_0_38153.wav	So, setting the field to be 0 on the boundary is not the correct boundary condition	test
audio_0_210141.wav	The aeroplanes, the jet engines what you have on the wings, you will have something like jet engines which grab air put a fuel, burn it, so that exhaust will come out and that can supply the thrust of that engine	test
audio_0_19525.wav	If no, please take the printout right away and then sit with me and try to solve the problem	test
audio_0_121492.wav	So, one can sum up and say that this is a dysfunctional domesticity and this is not the only dysfunctional domesticity mentioned in the story Khabuliwala	test
audio_0_182457.wav	So, basically you got these two	test
audio_0_172579.wav	So criterion of acceptance that can in some courses like music or sports there can be where the criteria are very clear	test
audio_0_122522.wav	Could it be over	test
audio_0_140860.wav	So it is becoming like the old case, similarly if you put, similarly, if you put this one as K, and this one as GP1 and put all the phase lag here then the problem will be to decide the inner loop	test
audio_0_229582.wav	So, if that is the case then any two parts produced if you want to make it as accurate as possible they it is next to impossible	test
audio_0_132183.wav	here it will be again delta t, we can all them: delta t one, delta t two, but everywhere in the heat exchanger the temperature difference will be delta t and that should be the mean temperature difference	test
audio_0_35430.wav	Even if you discretize it you cannot get a you can definitely not get a analytical expression for this G at best you can get numerical values for this	test
audio_0_189570.wav	We have 2 categories in this example, which are Sam and Senthil and they become the new columns, that are new variables and the values for those variables has to be picked from the column value, that is what this value dot variable suggests	test
audio_0_144786.wav	But on 2 January, we continue earlier balance of capital of 2 lakhs and we continue to write it on 2 January	test
audio_0_42151.wav	Now this is going to be a little bit tricky, how do I get the magnetic field now	test
audio_0_102704.wav	And so on the size happens this and then you come back and do the special window specific stuff on the original object	test
audio_0_182481.wav	So, basically there is a user 1 signal, user 2 signal and then there is noise	test
audio_0_82403.wav	Depletion type MOSFET constitutes this So, in this case if I want to draw a drain transfer characteristics, for depletion type MOSFET	test
audio_0_186043.wav	In this code we can see that if you want to access first and second row of the data frame that is created	test
audio_0_200767.wav	So this is my final circuit	test
audio_0_81753.wav	We can also indicate AC by a triangle or by square wave	test
audio_0_31543.wav	Do you follow	test
audio_0_24911.wav	So, he taught this course called creative engineering, where he introduced the whole idea of the fact that creativity could actually be a classroom session	test
audio_0_179846.wav	We also said that when you have an FDD system you have to be careful with the transmit and receive powers	test
audio_0_149775.wav	You can actually give the tip in a location which is saying the food is good and things like that	test
audio_0_6287.wav	So, this is your i 2 and this is your i 3, whatever we have explain	test
audio_0_78547.wav	So, in the last lecture, I started discussing the effect of physical factors and among this specifically stiffness in regulating stem cell fat	test
audio_0_156910.wav	So to break it down into BCNF, the rules says that the problem is with this district to state	test
audio_0_204040.wav	So, now we can see the curve and the center of this	test
audio_0_86653.wav	in particular, but mostly research papers and appropriate links would be provided at various stages during the videos and these links would be present in the slides and you could actually download these links and read those links to get more details about the concepts	test
audio_0_63709.wav	now a days, as i mentioned earlier, also, reduction of power has become of paramount importance	test
audio_0_148569.wav	This is cool, hey check this out with the URL there, right	test
audio_0_198538.wav	From these things we have to eliminate I1, I2 and V1	test
audio_0_188602.wav	So, from the R squared values of the two model, we can see that there is a drastic change by just removing one extreme point	test
audio_0_154005.wav	If it is a parallel gaze in a right handed person it means that, it is dominated by the auditory thinking, I want to recollect the songs which I cherished is a young child	test
audio_0_72208.wav	Based on an analysis of the characteristics of the product development team and the customer, the development lifecycle is decided	test
audio_0_59013.wav	sometimes it is meeting, sometimes it is not meeting changes in parameter values of transistors resistances over time	test
audio_0_206630.wav	Now from B drop a vertical line, that is this one let us call C	test
audio_0_221581.wav	Then, what do you know where we knew earlier that if you have correctly computed the distance up to s, then this update will correctly compute the distance of v 1, because this is the second last node on this	test
audio_0_121548.wav	So that daughter is also not fleshed out	test
audio_0_64675.wav	at least the signal nets, which are critical, which determine the clock frequency, and each chip or board usually has a limit to the number of interconnecting terminates that you can have	test
audio_0_84809.wav	So, now, what we have seen that in case of in case of oscillators, we can have several types of oscillators and now the application of oscillators we have seen mostly in using operation amplifier, but in some cases, we have also seen a crystal oscillator, we have also seen a UJT oscillator, right	test
audio_0_86253.wav	On the other hand, if the delay of each inverter is long than the frequency of the ring oscillator output will be much smaller, So, we could actually write the frequency of ring oscillator PUF like this, So, as is equal to 1 by 2 n t	test
audio_0_36832.wav	Yes good catch	test
audio_0_127409.wav	and if v	test
audio_0_164123.wav	Now, time t is equal to 1 you put the value of t as 1 you will get the value of voltage v at t equal to 1 is 20 volts	test
audio_0_195858.wav	So let's say we have the transistor and because we are feeding back to the source terminal, we keep the gate at a fixed voltage VG 0	test
audio_0_173503.wav	Then coming to Unit 5, our goal or our aim is to understand the role of accreditation, understand the criteria of NBA Self Assessment Report and understand the centrality of NBA accreditation in closing the quality loop at the levels of COs, POs and PSOs	test
audio_0_156863.wav	So then again this entire thing is searched and both commit T0 and commit T1 is found	test
audio_0_114416.wav	So, now you can represent your Z 1 and Z 2 in terms of that, now in the shunt case the total Z in is this	test
audio_0_190938.wav	So, I n minus 1 is not equal to I n, I n minus 1 is strictly contained in I n	test
audio_0_156146.wav	Now, it is probably easier to understand all those locks except the six locks	test
audio_0_23134.wav	then another is self regard	test
audio_0_235767.wav	Everybody wants to be a productive member of society	test
audio_0_141430.wav	Now you can I think understand it better	test
audio_0_199210.wav	There is a part of the characteristic where this i out versus v	test
audio_0_61552.wav	so the minimum distance between two adjacent grids depends on the components on these grid lines	test
audio_0_223246.wav	So, If I naively do it, I compute f 4 twice and in fact, when I compute this f 5, I actually get another f 4	test
audio_0_31001.wav	p square	test
audio_0_58700.wav	this is also called as the crowbar current and in modern day designs this short circuit power can consume so means of the tune of ah, twenty percent of the total power dissipation	test
audio_0_144679.wav	It can also be calculated for a particular project or for a particular SBU or division of the company	test
audio_0_4188.wav	Similarly, I m is the peak value of the current or maximum value of the current and here it is maximum value of the voltage	test
audio_0_19576.wav	So, whatever is new rate, sorry, new hours which is x, it will be 0	test
audio_0_121071.wav	And in my previous session I pointed out the difference between the people of Lucknow and the people in the countryside	test
audio_0_239608.wav	You could end up de motivating, a lot of other employees	test
audio_0_167035.wav	So here you see that R, L and C, both all all of 3 are in series, that is equivalent s minus domain of the given circuit would be; C will be replaced by 1 by sC and in place of L we will write SL	test
audio_0_232116.wav	I am too good, so the moment your mind things like that it is a fixed mindset, its rigidity of thinking	test
audio_0_26246.wav	Let us get to it, through a simpler mathematical example	test
audio_0_219248.wav	So, if we assume that this inductive invariant is true, now it is certainly true at the beginning because at the beginning, the only vertex that we have burnt is the start vertex s, right	test
audio_0_203977.wav	So, as we rotate one of them, the other one behave symmetrically about each other	test
audio_0_152583.wav	In comparison to that micro expressions occur in a fraction of a second and therefore, the detection is difficult	test
audio_0_235496.wav	So, that is called career planning	test
audio_0_101621.wav	Then according to this order this will be the next to get called and this will be the last to get call that is why you will see that it is person faculty student and TA constructor in that order that it will get constructed	test
audio_0_223446.wav	So, here is some code for this particular algorithm, the dynamic programming version, just to make it less confusing, I have explicitly used the variables r and c, instead of i and j	test
audio_0_13446.wav	This is the current signal write i, I will say it is maximum value say O A is equal to I m that is the maximum value of the current the peak value of the current right; that means, this one is equal to your I m sin theta, right	test
audio_0_239820.wav	that is another question, people have	test
audio_0_179475.wav	So, estimations can have estimation errors associated with it and then there is a finite delay in feeding back	test
audio_0_155730.wav	Some few of might be familiar with the famous American TV sitcom friends, which was aired between 1994 and 2004 for 10 seasons on NBC television	test
audio_0_207673.wav	This is the way we construct top view of that rectangle	test
audio_0_144244.wav	Now, international standard which is IFRS has been examined and effort has been made to bring down the differences and as far as possible harmonize the same	test
audio_0_224214.wav	So, automatically it will come out without having to do any further check	test
audio_0_3147.wav	So, this two point call half power point and the and this distance which we call bandwidth right, and this is if it is omega radian per second if it is frequency then it will be in hertz, so	test
audio_0_53536.wav	so over a closed curve, if i take d l f, it is equal to d s cross gradient of f	test
audio_0_145525.wav	The operating system should support some real time task scheduling policy like the rate monotonic scheduler	test
audio_0_83645.wav	If inverting terminal is grounded and the non inverting is also grounded, that means, it looks like we are virtually shorting the two ends of the op amp or the two input terminals of the op amp	test
audio_0_120075.wav	so i have different processes or applications which allows me to realize the thing	test
audio_0_64273.wav	so at the each of the end of this transmission line you can, you have to use a resistance for termination, right	test
audio_0_175145.wav	So that is where what you may call as psychomotor creating	test
audio_0_29227.wav	This whole thing, this part of it comes from the format	test
audio_0_84263.wav	Next 1 please, sSo, next white button you can see you have, if you wantcan to create an offset, you can create a offset by again changing the manual trigger or by using the display key the other push buttonskey, all right	test
audio_0_79317.wav	So, you must have them slightly above the integrins	test
audio_0_43628.wav	So, what do you think might be the advantage of something like this yeah	test
audio_0_142150.wav	But as long as nothing of that sort happens, it remains in the balance sheet as a contingent liability	test
audio_0_9323.wav	So, as we have taken the direction of the current moving upward	test
audio_0_56192.wav	they are obstacles	test

audio_0_114748.wav	they are based on the cache uses pattern	test
audio_0_152397.wav	So, now, let us look at the last analysis that the authors did was suspended profile analysis	test
audio_0_209245.wav	So, whether this much portion or perhaps longer one, 30 units	test
audio_0_202840.wav	So, we can always construct a plane surface which is passing through these three points	test
audio_0_31621.wav	All we manage to do is get rid of this k squared phi term ok, we still need to do a little bit more vector calculus	test
audio_0_153922.wav	This is one particular aspect of body language, which perhaps can be taken later on in live sessions	test
audio_0_148980.wav	So, again there is an insight here to show the number of days for a username change, this is 0 to 600, whereas this is just showing 0 to 1	test
audio_0_57794.wav	now i have to consider delay between this point and this point only, so the net delay or this signal propagation delay did not be all from vdd to here	test
audio_0_168143.wav	And our other measuring instruments like voltmeter and ammeter are designed to read the rms value directly, so that’s why the rms value is very important for our circuit analysis	test
audio_0_187663.wav	We have a list which already contains three attributes, you want add another attribute which is employee dot ages; for that I am creating a new list which contains the ages of the employees five employees	test
audio_0_201906.wav	So, we will go by new in the same way we will open a new solidworks document that is we will work on assembly, click ok	test
audio_0_99707.wav	Then you define a set using this list	test
audio_0_114944.wav	right, like i am accessing as a financial organization from organization say, one, two, another, some as some data in the organization two, and here i am accessing, as a, say, a manager of level one and that data in order to which is equivalent to manager of level two, they are	test
audio_0_80542.wav	So, we will see this experiment, let us see the same circuit he has attached, and I will show it to you how he has attached on the breadboard, and then we come back to the to the screen alright so, let us see the circuit	test
audio_0_118618.wav	so demand, you considered one plus e to power, minus t	test
audio_0_187930.wav	So, 1 and 2 are concordant that is what is indicated here	test
audio_0_225866.wav	So, notice that within a clause, I can only pick	test
audio_0_141299.wav	They can also say that out of 10 lakhs, we will finance only 6 lakhs	test
audio_0_55553.wav	or there is another method which propose that you can have a continuous value	test
audio_0_125382.wav	Now zero voltage between these two nodes	test
audio_0_113001.wav	So, by that you can connect an AC power or external power etcetera then you can also find out the probe that you are connecting, depending on that probe, that you can get proper impedance	test
audio_0_46271.wav	This is called the forward converter in the literature world over, so we will stick to that name	test
audio_0_197776.wav	And you can also find the current here ID by substituting that into vS minus VD by R or into the right hand side of this	test
audio_0_153487.wav	It is understood if people are not able to follow the deadlines because they have preferred to do some other thing within the allotted hour	test
audio_0_119944.wav	so now i will change the application	test
audio_0_237735.wav	Shareholder value perspective is, it might be expected that, fair and open recruitment training, in common practices, will make good sense, from a business point of view	test
audio_0_208943.wav	So, first do it in the reverse way from begin with 45 degrees, go for rotation of 30 degrees and finally, obtain this original figure	test
audio_0_37180.wav	What is that word, technical word	test
audio_0_63467.wav	there will be a set of rules i shall we shortly talking about	test
audio_0_45040.wav	Now let us go to the terminal and let me go to the directory, CD to the directory, and let me generate the net list	test
audio_0_151394.wav	With that, I will stop this particular paper	test
audio_0_29772.wav	And you think only of survival	test
audio_0_161177.wav	So it is not very easy to evaluate this expression	test
audio_0_185166.wav	Let me just end with the little bit of history	test
audio_0_70170.wav	So, there are modifications there is something like a semi hybrid and all those kinds of things, but do not get in the complexity just keep in mind you have 2 kinds of laminar flow hood a vertical laminar flow hood and a horizontal laminar flow hood	test
audio_0_205525.wav	The second one I would like to pass through that, comes in that direction, again pass through that B	test
audio_0_162781.wav	So, M will be I think to understand that this is y and n is z directed so, M will be x directed	test
audio_0_224977.wav	So, this has a parent somewhere about it, so if first make this left child point directly to the parent	test
audio_0_235221.wav	So, you have various types of benefits	test
audio_0_57155.wav	it will be upper bounded by one plus epsilon	test
audio_0_122079.wav	She wants me to tell you that she is very sorry if Appa has said anything to hurt you, you are not to misunderstand him	test
audio_0_170533.wav	Here the circuit with all independent sources equal to zero are present	test
audio_0_237620.wav	You have spoken to your supervisor	test
audio_0_145465.wav	So once we determine, develop the three tables for three different types of inversion when priority sealing protocol is used, we determine the highest entry corresponding to that task and use that value here and then determine whether the task set can be schedulable	test
audio_0_112233.wav	So, you see again I am doing that from P 1, I will be pulled i know that by 1 element I can be pulled in various ways	test
audio_0_232412.wav	Saumya Sharma	test
audio_0_221778.wav	Finally, having found that 55 is now bigger than 32, I will stop	test
audio_0_167102.wav	Now, if you consider y0 equal to 0 that is initially this system does not have any value	test
audio_0_148136.wav	If you scroll down to the very bottom of the results, you can see this paging object in the response which contains URLs to the previous and next set of results	test
audio_0_200039.wav	In this case, VS does increase but we also want to have feedback to the gate, so VG must decrease	test
audio_0_226377.wav	The surface illumination, this type of illumination shows that the surface of the workpiece, and is used in the observation and inspection of the workpiece	test
audio_0_151795.wav	As always you can let me know what you think I am on Twitter, Facebook, Google or VK on anniegaus and you can get a free netflix trial with a signup on Netflix dot com slash wtbd, thanks for watching	test
audio_0_63429.wav	in the first case, what is the maximum path	test
audio_0_101571.wav	Now, we will look into some of the more integrate use scenarios and let us say that we have the students teacher TA scenario, where a TA is a student, TA is a teacher and both of them are persons	test
audio_0_205479.wav	So, if I am visualizing this object, this part where the hatched portion is there we have that hatched lines	test
audio_0_203477.wav	For that again I can use smart dimension	test
audio_0_231002.wav	And next thing, you are trying to control this variable	test
audio_0_1301.wav	So, when you studied that your single phase AC circuits are the type we showed that how emf is generated	test
audio_0_42069.wav	What was remember the overall objective	test
audio_0_2372.wav	Now, I0 is equally small no load current and loss is neglected right	test
audio_0_82104.wav	Switch off the power before you start working on other parts, or you note down in your notebook, or you lock down the results in your system, right	test
audio_0_122721.wav	And again, he cries, and that cry is associated with animal howling	test
audio_0_162602.wav	So, T A is the effective noise temperature of the antenna and G theta phi is the power gain pattern	test
audio_0_121878.wav	As I said, the study or the studio or the space in which the father sits down and writes is the most important space in the entire house	test
audio_0_72046.wav	For example, a word processing software, an antivirus software, or maybe a database management system and so on, these are products which have already been developed	test
audio_0_117136.wav	we know already that environmental, health care, education, defense, manufacturing, smart phones and anything where where you require some sort of a sensing and monitoring of the things	test
audio_0_203293.wav	So, the intersection points are at this P1, P2, P3, P4, and so on	test
audio_0_80644.wav	So, this is just a current mirror action, if you see M 1 and M 2 , if error increases my VDS my I reference increases	test
audio_0_118505.wav	we will cloud compromise, leak, confidential client data right, fear of loss of control over the data	test
audio_0_64774.wav	starting with a initial partition, we repeat iteratively the process till the cutsets keep improving	test
audio_0_203939.wav	Once again, you can see say I want to align this particular face over this larger rectangle	test
audio_0_195577.wav	So v	test
audio_0_43192.wav	So, for example, the first thing over here, this is can anyone tell me what is this; this structure over here	test
audio_0_47967.wav	add a point r	test
audio_0_119787.wav	cloud services now act as a computational data processing platform as well as management platform for iots right	test
audio_0_133363.wav	Humour	test
audio_0_197881.wav	You have to solve a quadratic equation and it comes out quite easily and you will see that that will be 200 microamperors	test
audio_0_77404.wav	So, we have units of mu has to be newton per meter square * second or this is called Pascal second you see units of viscosity	test
audio_0_230675.wav	Square slip gauge have larger surface area and lesser wear rate they are they also adhere better to each other when wrung together, wrung is an operation	test
audio_0_83272.wav	Solve for the output voltage we have to find Vo right the input voltage to V1 terminal and input resistance to V1 terminal for three cases V1 equals to 0 and V1 equals to minus VI2	test
audio_0_104760.wav	It is strictly avoidable that you write a function and do not put a return	test
audio_0_221749.wav	So, what do is, we have an initial array A, from position 0 to n minus 1	test
audio_0_221899.wav	In general, if I give you now A times B times C times D, then you can do many things, you can do A B, C D and then multiply or you can do C D, then B C D, then A B C D or you can do A B, then A B C, then A B C D	test
audio_0_165829.wav	So in this case, if you see v 1 is applied on the left side of the coil, v 2 is applied at the right side of the coil, M is the mutual inductance, L 1 and L 2 are the self inductances of both coils	test
audio_0_51500.wav	lets take z square plus s prime square to be sum y square, so that y d y is equal to s prime d s prime	test
audio_0_123129.wav	And this kind of authority is something that is underlined in this story	test
audio_0_209174.wav	For that purpose you click your scroll button, click and move the mouse in different directions ok	test
audio_0_218221.wav	oh, sorry, if it is really switching at high frequency, you will almost get a constant d c with a little bit jagging, but you will almost get a constant d, c	test
audio_0_224525.wav	So, the question is how big are the recursive problems	test
audio_0_176409.wav	On what basis do I select	test
audio_0_146755.wav	also there is no precedence ordering among tasks like one task always need to run after that the other task and run etc those situations don't exist so this is the simplest situation uniprocessor with independent tasks but of course may not be very practical because in many applications we might have multiprocessor being used or we might have tasks with share results with each other or there may be precedence ordering but for our understanding let's start with the simplest one and as we proceed we will relax these constraints that tasks, share resources and what needs to be done to the scheduler, precedence ordering what needs to be done to the schedulers, and multiprocessor what kind of changes are needed	test
audio_0_236247.wav	And, if I get a good deal for the business, I could get a personal bonus	test
audio_0_197111.wav	Then the signal source must be applied to the gate of the transistor	test
audio_0_206989.wav	Wherever you move this drafter, it always shows only horizontal and vertical directions	test
audio_0_188968.wav	Now, more complicated problems are where hyper plane or a line might not be enough for us to classify	test
audio_0_40824.wav	We have seen the kind of operators that we have had so far right, del squared plus k squared differentiation operators are there	test
audio_0_64759.wav	lets say here, this will break this up into one cluster like this, another cluster like this	test
audio_0_63933.wav	if the switch is off, that voltage will not go	test
audio_0_180936.wav	So, what is available for traffic would be 700, traffic is 700, now I want to use a 7 cell pattern, 7 cell pattern and let me show you how to visualize a seven cell pattern basically we will, let me see if I have a figure that that will make it easier	test
audio_0_226845.wav	So, the resistance of potentiometer per unit length is equal to 10000 divided by 50 which is 200 ohm per millimetre	test
audio_0_223514.wav	So, therefore, I solve both of these problems in principle and take their maximum, the better of them	test
audio_0_186802.wav	So, that is the reason why we are still sticking to this beta naught plus beta 1 X	test
audio_0_195029.wav	Now, we saw that we had to have a VGS of 3 volts and VDS I am showing a voltage source here, I will call it VDS 0, the VDS at the operating point	test
audio_0_99068.wav	So, this is just to highlight through a simple example that the order of the data member can be critical and while writing the initialization list, you should be aware of the order in which the data members are actually created	test
audio_0_228371.wav	So, all this features that we measured are also stored here the data is stored	test
audio_0_212956.wav	you are actually getting ah, much lower values	test
audio_0_212472.wav	so look at how it can be applied at least once, where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates can occur	test
audio_0_218973.wav	If there are N variables, each of them has two possibilities, clearly there are 2 to the N, so an exponential number of possible assignments	test
audio_0_111561.wav	So, I thing that is you see this type of complicated things with the help of signal flow graph it got very simplifier that is why it is a very elegant and useful tool for micro designers	test
audio_0_38681.wav	So, finally, what all did we have left over here, the first term gave us	test
audio_0_100145.wav	I have q pointer which is of pointing to B type	test
audio_0_56486.wav	this: i one s one is the input and o one n one is the expected output	test
audio_0_60970.wav	so i, h are already having a gap of one	test
audio_0_100644.wav	Suppose this is not commented, so what happens is it is doing something comes across an error and it throws one	test

audio_0_234853.wav	It is freely available in the market, if you need it	test
audio_0_157090.wav	So how does one recover	test
audio_0_64820.wav	but ah, the calculation will be slightly more complex and the partition sizes must be known before end the time	test
audio_0_24299.wav	Okay, So Siddharth question to you is, you have mapped your personal experience to this problem I can see but, now I see that the segment that you have picked is very specific to this and I can see my own reasons why you went but I really want to know it from you guys is to why from overall vision perspective, why this segment and why it makes sense for you guys 4 of you	test
audio_0_84253.wav	So, do not worry when you look at something which is complex the operation is really simple, all right	test
audio_0_73594.wav	It may be inaccurate because the necessary information may not be available in the early phase	test
audio_0_115361.wav	i write localhost five thousand, so it is showing me hello world, right	test
audio_0_224570.wav	But, in Quicksort you can prove that the expected running time across all possible random inputs equally likely inputs, is actually order n log n	test

audio_0_25996.wav	So, we can intersperse messages with values, with names, to produce meaningful output that is more readable	test
audio_0_114537.wav	so there are different type of grids	test
audio_0_206632.wav	So, whatever the B C length is there the same B C length we will draw it	test
audio_0_210829.wav	So, for that purpose, first of all, one has to construct an ellipse, this is the idealistic case	test
audio_0_214891.wav	its now any number of channels can actually be, um, you know, assigned for the purposes of advertisement	test
audio_0_68.wav	Now the question is whether you know really this is the average and you know there are some quality parameters which are desirable there are some quality parameters which undesirable	test
audio_0_208790.wav	Let us begin the step once again	test
audio_0_42214.wav	Again still does not look very very straightforward over here, can I take something common from, can I looking at this the first term has a n y in both the terms, the second term has a n x in both the terms right	test
audio_0_223168.wav	So, Shannon and Fano, proposed the divide and conquer thing, so what us it was let us look at the encoding of the alphabet	test
audio_0_115968.wav	that is the thing now	test
audio_0_163064.wav	But just I will sketch that, whatever you learned if you want to explore that antenna synthesis problem, you can go with this background ok	test
audio_0_224224.wav	Now if there is a way to combine the two halves efficiently to get a fully sorted array, then we can say that we have achieved the sorting by breaking it up into two smaller sub problems and combining the result	test
audio_0_26186.wav	So we keep looking for values as they increase	test
audio_0_198930.wav	Now we know that for VSD equals 3 volts, the drain current of the mass transistor will be 200 microamperors, and this will be 20 volts, and we wanted 4 volts across the mass transistor, so this VDD will be 24 volts	test
audio_0_70346.wav	So, that has to be a little bit of background or introduction should be described first	test
audio_0_95897.wav	but remember, other things will be aligned towards the left and open punctuation will be there in the body of the letter	test
audio_0_124427.wav	in this case in fact this completely impractical	test
audio_0_203379.wav	So, the first one what we are going to do is move your mouse give a left click	test
audio_0_192733.wav	So, now I might as well write this though we do not need it in the previous problem, there is such a bijection also from prime ideals of R containing I and here also you put prime ideals of R mod I	test
audio_0_42504.wav	Now whatever is unwanted I should move to the other side right	test
audio_0_144817.wav	Since the new inventory is purchased, inventory has become 2 lakhs, this is a transaction on credit	test
audio_0_209213.wav	So, let us try with some other 3D object or perhaps I would like to make holes through these centers	test
audio_0_159800.wav	So these must take care of the durability issues	test
audio_0_165553.wav	Otherwise when the rank is equal to n you will say the system is observable	test

audio_0_17867.wav	If you assume it is ground in nodal analysis you we will apply right	test
audio_0_178047.wav	So, that basically sets your electronic noise floor right and the if you multiply it by the bandwidth of the receiver that tells you basically where you will have to set your threshold beyond that there is noise that your receiver will add that that gives you the that is the additional noise level	test
audio_0_135942.wav	Now Okonkwo from his very childhood feels ashamed about his father and his entire character is in turn shaped by a desire to separate himself from the kind of identity that his father has in Umuofia and to fashion himself as an absolute contrast to his father, as someone who is physically strong and courageous, as against the cowardliness of his father	test
audio_0_215111.wav	there was no application	test
audio_0_97655.wav	It is just a scoping rule, class also does scoping, but it does scoping with class semantics	test
audio_0_176135.wav	That means their extension is much larger for classical concepts	test
audio_0_189558.wav	So, when the melt command is executed, it will take this Id variables and keep them assist and then convert the measure variables into, one single column which is given by variable and stores the values of those variables, in another column by name value, that is what when you say in this syntax variable dot name is variable and value dot name is value means	test
audio_0_184428.wav	Now, P gamma over P bar I want you take a moment to do that	test
audio_0_57045.wav	there can be other edges also, so potentially there can be edge between any pair of vertices	test

audio_0_25915.wav	So, it is not as though the very first time we find an error which is not handled it will abort it will merely pass control back to where it was called from and across the sequence of calls hierarchically we can catch it at any point	test
audio_0_19739.wav	So, total fixed extra fixed cost will be only 3 lakhs, profit expected is 1 lakh	test
audio_0_119994.wav	it is not like that, that simple: how, how we are trying to pose the problem, ah, how we are discussing, but there may be a lot of calculation of projects and and type of things	test
audio_0_174824.wav	You are remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating and creating	test
audio_0_233660.wav	But, you are not able to use it on the job	test
audio_0_168931.wav	So, when you discussing about the source free response of rc circuit we termed this tau as time constant which was nothing but equal to rc	test
audio_0_136435.wav	It means that product lifecycle is in product lifetime is less so the whole product lifecycle of conception design process planning installation production everything will have to be accelerated how can you accelerate it you cannot accelerate it you cannot make new and new designs very fast you cannot produce them fast without having without having manufacturing systems	test
audio_0_221274.wav	So, you can just keep oscillating between these 2 slices overall here 2 n squared space	test
audio_0_20945.wav	Now, company proposes to increase the sale of any one product line by 20%, but they don't have extra direct labour	test
audio_0_174707.wav	And in the next unit, we will try to compute the attainment of course outcomes	test
audio_0_236060.wav	And, in small businesses, it is trust based	test
audio_0_171814.wav	Now let us move on to another concept called network stability, here the circuit is stable if its impulse response is bounded, means the h t converses to the finite value when t tends to infinity and if it is unstable if s t grows without bounds s t tends to infinity	test
audio_0_60324.wav	so for totally random data, pi will be point five and hence alpha	test

audio_0_61283.wav	so there is a concept called false path that we shall be particularly considering in this lecture	test
audio_0_40834.wav	Now, in terms of an operator right now we are not discretizing anything it is just an operator ok	test
audio_0_95578.wav	it actually gives you an instruction, where it is mentioned very talks about the problem and it also tells you the scope, meaning thereby who will read this report, what actually is to be done in the report	test
audio_0_175338.wav	Whereas in the others, the mapping strength is much lower	test
audio_0_91663.wav	So, in this lecture we will be talking about two different techniques two different methods for getting interpolating polynomial	test
audio_0_137665.wav	And then if you can, if you have these two conditions satisfied then analytically the controller parameters can be solved from the above two models, how	test
audio_0_145271.wav	So, this we already shown earlier	test
audio_0_216838.wav	so, basically, it's a pulse sensors reading the ah, the, the pulse of the human, and you can see that this whole system, ah, essentially has no battery	test
audio_0_76445.wav	And these, So, these are disulfide bonds	test
audio_0_235781.wav	So, write this down	test
audio_0_210051.wav	For that purpose, we try to use the function values, we use the function values and also their derivatives try to impose it different points to get that surface and that matrix based on how smooth that is how regularly it is conditioned or ill conditioned based on that we will be going to construct these surfaces	test
audio_0_119430.wav	so we will, we will ah break for now and we will continue our discussion in the subsequent, in the next lecture	test
audio_0_28341.wav	The dependency structure may not require us to fill it in a particular way we might have very different ways to fill it up, all we want to do is systematically fill up this table in an iterative fashion not recursively we do not want to call f of I, j and then look at f of i minus 1, j	test
audio_0_77000.wav	So, these lengths are different	test
audio_0_51343.wav	i know that e reflected, for whatever we derived in the lecture through boundary conditions is nothing, but earlier we wrote it for the string v two minus v one over v two plus v one, which could also be written as n one minus n two over n one plus n two times o e incident e incident	test
audio_0_48221.wav	d z integral is minus l by two to l by two	test
audio_0_40655.wav	If I wanted to minimize the reflection at some other angle is it possible, you have to change the boundary condition right	test
audio_0_193899.wav	So, each step I hope is clear	test
audio_0_235260.wav	So, we all get tempted	test
audio_0_224958.wav	So, we have back in the simpler case one of these two cases	test
audio_0_83151.wav	This is the question this is the problem given to us	test
audio_0_94912.wav	as i said when we were talking about the patterns of presentation and the methods of presentation, the very first thing that all of you could have found very interesting was a presentation that was memorized	test
audio_0_220086.wav	So, this is one saving	test
audio_0_24860.wav	So, I have done this in a field in a class in Italy	test
audio_0_106771.wav	So, their names figure in filing in a patent application as the inventors	test
audio_0_158252.wav	And at the end of this course and at the end of this certification exams, you will have quite a good grip on what database systems are all about, the UG database systems and you will be very much comfortable and confident about handling issues for databases	test
audio_0_35505.wav	So, for complicated objects this is itself for big task imagine you are given let us say like you know some you know MiG 21 or something you need to have a realistic 3D model of this in the computer and then you have to for the fracture it ok	test
audio_0_1076.wav	If you have understood this thing, then there is no need to keep it in mind easily you can make it right now computational procedure	test
audio_0_212508.wav	ah, there is confirm and conformance targets and m q t t server, m q t t client and so on	test
audio_0_154201.wav	His theory is that there is a connection between a countries level of instability and finding smiling stupid, after all how can you be so confident and happy when the future is uncertain, that might help explain stereotypically frowny places like Russia, where smiling in photos is not really a thing	test
audio_0_121297.wav	Now you can tell from Mirza's interest in the political downfall that he is losing his game of chess	test
audio_0_82940.wav	Maximum rate of change of output voltage	test
audio_0_142171.wav	Please go to your balance sheet in it may be shown as shareholder fund or owner's fund in your balance sheet now many of you might be investing in mutual funds if you invest in you can start investing now if you invest in mutual fund for that scheme every, every day NAV is announced	test
audio_0_234952.wav	So, we all take on, a little bit of extra work	test
audio_0_107468.wav	Geographical indications usually referred to a write that is in common to a community, but we know instances where the universities have taken initiative in getting certain GIS register and trade secret code also come out of university work	test
audio_0_103030.wav	So what are you doing you are expected to write anything to that port because you are expecting data from the outside the system, so you are only reading, reading, reading	test
audio_0_95271.wav	moreover, at times it so appears that you cannot provide every information in a paragraph	test
audio_0_230416.wav	A frequent use of angle gauge is to check, whether the component is within its off angle tolerance	test
audio_0_39237.wav	I can as well write it as like this gradient of f is equal to x hat, y hat and z hat	test
audio_0_12884.wav	And another one is that at t is equal to 3 second	test
audio_0_122568.wav	What sort of adult world is the thing that they have as models and how is that impacting on the children who are playing in that big household	test
audio_0_117.wav	So, once this decisions preparatory to the control charts have been take, and now the question is how to starts the control charts plotting	test
audio_0_34693.wav	So, in this discussion we are assuming there is no current supplied if there were a current then it would also appear in this F H equation ok	test
audio_0_100633.wav	Let us look at a more detailed example and try to understand this	test
audio_0_87141.wav	Similarly a glitch in the clock source for the device can create a setup or a hold violation injecting a fault into the operation of that device	test
audio_0_8789.wav	In small and medium size motors, the bars and end rings are made of die cast aluminium moulded to form an in your what you call an integral block	test
audio_0_145722.wav	If the deadline is 100 millisecond then it needs to complete by 100 millisecond and there is no reward if it completes in 1 millisecond let us say	test
audio_0_35965.wav	So, this is m equations in total and most importantly what has happened is the information about the electric field the incident electric field has nicely appeared over here	test
audio_0_6374.wav	So, this is for V o c is equal to V Thevenin you can get this is this is your what you call that your 4 ampere current, that is the independent current source and this is 10 ohm and this is 4 ohm right	test
audio_0_208580.wav	So, already we have made some division like CV and VF	test
audio_0_195669.wav	The current obtained from this term, what I have shown in black is what I have plotted here	test
audio_0_229942.wav	So, we will have a primary sensor to measure and then this primary sensor element whatever is there it then it is sent to a Variable Conversion Element	test
audio_0_32840.wav	If I had the opposite sign convention for time if I had e to the minus j omega t what will happen	test
audio_0_144745.wav	I hope you have made it and you are rechecking it	test
audio_0_26340.wav	So, we take up list 1, which is the second list	test
audio_0_132570.wav	so how are we going to do that	test
audio_0_92696.wav	So, if we integrate this partially with respect to x, then what we will get here we have 2 x	test
audio_0_136217.wav	And he also becomes the sort of primary enemy the arch enemy of Moorthy in the novel	test
audio_0_60471.wav	right, that is the property of grey code	test
audio_0_182407.wav	So, this is correct	test
audio_0_178094.wav	The question that is being asked is what is the transmitted power EIRP that is the question and usually this is how this is a more important type of question that arises given all these scenarios what is the received signal power oh sorry transmitted signal power what I want to guarantee is the signal to noise ratio at the receiver Ps by Pn and I want to it give a fading margin as well	test
audio_0_117924.wav	ah, predict and respond proactively on some situations and supports your strategy with any data	test
audio_0_52836.wav	although i can write the answer right away, i'll show you how to systematically get it using gauss law	test
audio_0_60851.wav	like, for example, let say, i want that my circuit needs to work at some particular clock frequency so you can make an analysis and you can predict that well, to make my circuit work at this particular clock, my maximum net length can never exceed this	test
audio_0_211293.wav	we will discuss that in a moment	test
audio_0_112318.wav	So, propagation constant gamma that does not have any real part, it has the imaginary part j b that is why the face constant is only shown	test
audio_0_188473.wav	When we try to solve Ax equal to b, we can write that equation as A x minus b, and if there is a perfect solution to the set of equations then Ax minus b will be equal to 0	test
audio_0_116192.wav	first of all, what we look at, the speed and flexibility mobile applications can be build on or revised quickly using the cloud services	test
audio_0_146707.wav	If there are n tasks waiting in the queue, not a very efficient solution	test
audio_0_178424.wav	5 milliseconds; still in the millisecond range much less than that	test
audio_0_111721.wav	Now see the third problem, that S matrix of the following 2 port network	test
audio_0_63949.wav	ah, so this d will go to q and afterwards, when clock goes back to zero again, this transistor will be off	test
audio_0_225106.wav	We also said that this heap in principle is flexible and can grow as large as we want	test
audio_0_170556.wav	So whatever the larger network outside the area of your study is present you will simply equal that network which is outside the area of your study by Thevenin equivalent	test
audio_0_77735.wav	So, tau is my shear stress tau is my shear stress	test
audio_0_13253.wav	And similarly it is minus 4 delta t minus 2	test
audio_0_218367.wav	could be all these digital loads, ok, laptops ah, then handhelds, all of them, which dont mind essentially ah, which have a lot of ripple	test
audio_0_185948.wav	So, we will see what happens if there are 2 constraints, so in this case we are going to minimize f of x and now let us say we have 2 constraints we are going to say h 1 x equal to 0 h 2 x equal to 0	test
audio_0_27196.wav	Having read from a file then the other thing that we would like to do is to write to a file	test
audio_0_137906.wav	Because it is incompressible, so the pressure can very quickly rise to high values sometimes if there is jamming, so therefore there are always mechanisms such that such pressures can be, has to be released	test
audio_0_59924.wav	ok, lets illustrate it with an example	test
audio_0_238070.wav	Because, for whatever reason, there is been a massive snowstorm	test
audio_0_98276.wav	So, to start with continuing with the same example, now this is again coded in C++	test
audio_0_99408.wav	Rest of the implementation and this application is no different from earlier	test
audio_0_217132.wav	here we can see there is a tipping mass that has been applied and it is fixed to this surface which is vibrating, using this screw	test
audio_0_155480.wav	Recent studies which are being conducted now have extended the view to combinations of facial expression and body posture and they have found evidence for cross culturally a stable patterns of pride and shame as well	test
audio_0_201240.wav	So putting all these things together, we can see that if you fix the drain bias current ID, the variation in GM is per volt square	test
audio_0_81840.wav	here tThe power is or voltage is 0 volts or 0	test
audio_0_194426.wav	So, the goal today is to study prime ideals and maximal ideals	test
audio_0_150601.wav	Tips as I said, users can post tips at specific venues commenting on their previous experiences when visiting the corresponding physical places	test
audio_0_193483.wav	So, I am claiming that the element 2 in the ring R which is Z adjoined square root minus 5 is irreducible, but not prime so, in general in other words irreducible elements need not be prime	test
audio_0_194820.wav	So, we have this additional conductance GDS	test
audio_0_63226.wav	so, among all the possible matchings, we are finding one matching which is of minimum size	test
audio_0_37374.wav	So, E y on the left and E y on the right and subtract these two, but what I do is d E y by dx I am going to take the average over 2 time instance; 2 time instances	test
audio_0_117957.wav	create a, create a web app of your own and then browse through this particular u r l to open the newly created app correct so that you basically you ah	test
audio_0_18591.wav	That means, V m I m and if you it will be minus sin omega t into cos omega t, because, it is your sin omega t minus 90 degree	test
audio_0_161367.wav	So I mentioned that these are disk based design	test
audio_0_238865.wav	Fixed versus variable socialization	test
audio_0_222269.wav	So, what this really means is that, t of n and g of n are basically are of the same order of magnitude, they are essentially the same function therefore, you have reached a kind of optimum value	test
audio_0_210192.wav	Whereas, a drawing sheets and other things what manually we do they have a lifetime	test
audio_0_103340.wav	Now if I provide the implementation, also its purity does not go away, because I am saying that it is it is a pure function	test
audio_0_104874.wav	Array needs all elements must be of the same time	test
audio_0_4595.wav	And obtain the resulting current, then, you obtain the i 0	test
audio_0_181774.wav	So, what did you get	test
audio_0_225042.wav	So, notice that our solution, because the greedy solution processes things in deadline order, there cannot be any inversions in our schedule, but the optimum schedule the arbitrary optimum schedule that we have presented with may well have inversions	test
audio_0_132518.wav	so in that case it was a liquid water heat pump	test
audio_0_21009.wav	Same way you can record, calculate the variable admin expenses, variable selling expenses, operating profit and so on	test
audio_0_112496.wav	So, you can find S parameter then S 2 Z you can reconvert back that formula is given here	test
audio_0_33824.wav	So, now, the same edge, has 2 different values	test
audio_0_142026.wav	So, we were discussing financial statements, particularly we were discussing balance sheet, we have also seen the format of balance sheet and now we are discussing each element of balance sheet	test
audio_0_164811.wav	So, this is the final state diagram which you will get and this will represent these particular differential equation	test
audio_0_51333.wav	in fact it's one and a half times farther	test
audio_0_66911.wav	So, it means in order to obtain a Schwann cells your source animal source has to be a matured animal	test
audio_0_121303.wav	Poor Nawab Sahib must be shedding tears of blood	test
audio_0_6392.wav	So, because 10 i x we got thirty volt plus terminal is encountering first directly writing that 32 right and, this 0	test
audio_0_35478.wav	So, what we will do is I mean, you are on the right track and then you deviated, use FEM for the interior objects	test
audio_0_10242.wav	Now, from equation 1 and 2 so, you will get copper loss is equal to R e 2 because R e 2 into I 2 square so, here we are putting I 2	test
audio_0_194602.wav	So, if you have any polynomial in it its degree must be more than 2 or the polynomial must be 0	test
audio_0_5485.wav	So, because we know admittance earlier we have seen	test
audio_0_32741.wav	Same as before it has to be out wards	test
audio_0_233877.wav	You could have learning management systems	test
audio_0_214234.wav	nordic semiconductor, for instance, uses a lot of arm ah core in its in its processor offerings, ah	test
audio_0_99639.wav	That is the basic power of the class template and this gives us lot of generalization in terms of the data structures in particular and different utility classes	test
audio_0_67782.wav	So, you can have the bar graph like this something like this, then say for example, Q really brings it down just hypothetically I am just putting say for example, Q here you see some sort of an improvement in say why you see a much more improvement and here you see some improvement or something not ok	test
audio_0_221674.wav	So, can we solve this problem by reducing it to a simpler problem	test
audio_0_36365.wav	So, many tools and techniques were available	test
audio_0_130876.wav	so here what we see that we will have ah, all the processes, and here the condensation process in a condenser is replaced by process heating	test
audio_0_202091.wav	Then from there, join this one	test
audio_0_101435.wav	So, what does this mean what is x, x here is the x of MyClass, so it is this variable	test
audio_0_57784.wav	ok, now another thing: you observed at the level of the gates this looks very fine that even if you swap this, no change	test
audio_0_70018.wav	So, when we go for 50 we talk about a very low density and it took 150 these are high density cultures again there are people who may disagree they can go a little higher also, but I personally after working with hippocampal neuron for more than a decade I will not recommend that	test
audio_0_96789.wav	In the second in case of d we just show the same thing in a different alternate notation this is called list initialization	test
audio_0_155528.wav	It really does take more muscles to frown than it does to smile	test
audio_0_192416.wav	Hence, R is a ring ok	test
audio_0_135155.wav	So for seeing or viewing the result you can press this button, display test results or if you directly want take the print out, you can click on the print test results	test
audio_0_214315.wav	so then you have less heat, less heat generation, correct, the design geometries are much smaller, ahy, therefore design geometry, geometry is smaller	test
audio_0_151730.wav	Now your program has been successfully able to capture the post, which you posted in real time	test
audio_0_233884.wav	Then there could be a video component	test
audio_0_219347.wav	So we have been looking at unweighted graphs, that is sets of vertices and sets of edges where each edge is just a connection between two vertices	test
audio_0_223134.wav	And then at a next level which is 1 plus the depth of the xy, I will add the node f x and I add the node f x and I will get the components x y, f x times that plus x y times, I am subtracting this amount in the left, then I am adding this amount to the right	test
audio_0_105415.wav	So, we have now saying that let us extend this polymorphic hierarchy with abstract base class	test
audio_0_55056.wav	So, I can write this as R square d cosine of theta, because this angle is theta d phi times d r, where d r is this distance along the radial direction	test
audio_0_88509.wav	The objective of making the hardware Trojan extremely small is the fact that it is very difficult to actually detect such a hardware Trojan while for example viewing the code or just looking at the device it is very difficult given the size and the number of transistors and gates present in the device, this additional hardware present due to the hardware Trojan may easily go unnoticeable	test
audio_0_46665.wav	So you will see things changing and then you can keep experimenting with it and then go back to the simulation, plug in the values and see what are the values that you would get	test
audio_0_226399.wav	I have given a brief information on what are frequency distributions, how do we construct a frequency distributions	test
audio_0_154997.wav	The functions of plant pauses are displayed in this particular visual, the different ways in which we can use a plant paused are succinctly presented	test
audio_0_160414.wav	So these are nowadays becoming very, very popular	test
audio_0_206782.wav	If that is the case can we construct views of the object	test
audio_0_146855.wav	Some other code runs and then starts running the kernel code where it left	test
audio_0_100537.wav	Since pointer points to different other data, unless a pointer is constant, I can actually change the data that it is pointing to	test
audio_0_224846.wav	And then, once again we must walk on to the left of tree, so you walk to the left child	test
audio_0_213297.wav	so this power requirement of ah peak power requirement of a seventy ah sleep power requirement of fifteen milli watt, all of this leads to deciding what should be the size of your panel, right	test
audio_0_210603.wav	So, that I can really construct a triangle make a tool to pass through that and click ok	test
audio_0_44658.wav	Let me go here and first save this	test
audio_0_3660.wav	You have to find out t the switch was closed and has been closed for a long time	test
audio_0_213677.wav	particularly, there is a generator called linear congruential generator, l c g	test
audio_0_215454.wav	see, when i say r f i d system, you have to note that it includes what is known as a reader and what are and and a tag	test
audio_0_76017.wav	So, in this mouse model, you generate breast tumors, this is a mouse model with long latency periods	test
audio_0_211754.wav	so, just to give you ah a possibility that if you make such a measurement, dont be surprised to see that in one measurement you get a different values and um compared to one measurement, and and another time you get a different range of values	test
audio_0_223808.wav	So, we will compute factorial for n minus 1 multiply by n and then return this answer, well	test
audio_0_102555.wav	So, it strongly supports the object oriented paradigm though it as some lacunae in that and those may be beyond the discussion of this course	test
audio_0_165764.wav	Now I 1 is now allowed to increase from 0 to capital I 1 that is one arbitrary value we are considering	test
audio_0_54615.wav	it is equal to the local e at that point, which will be a combination of the applied field and the field which is generated due to this induced charges which come because of the polarization	test
audio_0_155263.wav	Cultures where touch is not encouraged include several Asian and European countries including Germany, Japan, England, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Estonia, Portugal, Northern Europe and Scandinavia	test
audio_0_171672.wav	You have to recollect what is the expression for voltage, that is nothing but change in energy with respect to charges flowing through that particular element	test
audio_0_58024.wav	ok, lets take a example	test
audio_0_16192.wav	So is; that means, K is equal to you know that phi 1 2 upon phi 1, phi 1 is the total flux and phi 1 2 is the flux linking the other coil	test
audio_0_180838.wav	Now the interfering signals strength decays as you move away from base station B	test
audio_0_149898.wav	It is the total number of tips that are available in the dataset is about 10 million, total number of dones is about 9 million, and mayor ship is about 15 million and different venues that are available are about 15 million again	test
audio_0_132734.wav	so by abiding these laws we try to get the optimum kind of arrangement of the stream and heat integration	test
audio_0_44242.wav	So, for a PEC E z is equal to 0	test
audio_0_182022.wav	Regarding channel inversion, sir	test
audio_0_190310.wav	And remember, it has to be exactly one of them as this solution shows if it contains Q it cannot contain F p if it contains F p, it cannot contain F q for some other prime Q ok, so it is exactly one	test
audio_0_45358.wav	Likewise, you can also try to do it for the flyback design, which I have given a sample design spec here	test
audio_0_40429.wav	In Green’s function I have r comma r prime, and so always the distance between r and r prime, so that is what I am write it	test
audio_0_176627.wav	Then the next one is “clarity”	test
audio_0_175782.wav	When should I switch to another strategy	test
audio_0_232994.wav	Unions	test
audio_0_209066.wav	Now, any sketch we would like to draw that we begin it on front plane	test
audio_0_39894.wav	Here, however, there is a certain symmetry is missing over here, because I mean the second antenna is on one side, so I cannot in good I mean being honest, I cannot take some you know distance a apart and do testing on that point	test
audio_0_148137.wav	And if you look at this URL carefully, you will find a limit parameter which is set to 25 by default	test
audio_0_46163.wav	If you consciously assign labels then you will be able to get more insight analyze and know the understand the net list much better so let me call this as node A and I'll copy this paste it I will rotate it and I will call this node B by this what I have done I have given a conscious label to this node now when I want to refer to the input source I will say VA minus VB which will give me the value of the result of that waveform then we could give a node number here and let us say we call this as and we could give a node for this point we will call this as C we can give one more node here I would like to place here I would like to place a track impedance here to introduce a non ideality later on so for now I will just not give this label I will give this I will remove this label and denote this label as O so that we know it is an output label	test
audio_0_213163.wav	maybe, ah, i can expand this part very well	test
audio_0_122859.wav	We get descriptions of Lakshmi, we get descriptions of the servants, the bearers who serves Mohan Lal, but we do not get a detailed narrative about the consciousness or the motivations of the other characters just as we get with Sir Mohan Lal	test
audio_0_235016.wav	Voluntary separation occurs, when an employee decides, for personal or professional reasons, to end the relationship, with the employer	test
audio_0_193474.wav	So, there are 2, 5, 2, 3, 5, 7 so on and of course, we can also consider nothing in the definition, disallows these allows negatives of these are also prime elements or irreducible elements ok	test
audio_0_13079.wav	So, now, using source transformation determine i x in the circuit your shown in figure this 14 that is it is chapter topic 4	test
audio_0_231215.wav	We have seen the meaning for mechanical measurement and then we have seen what is the need for measurement	test
audio_0_8056.wav	So, again encountering clock wise it is going encountering plus terminal plus	test
audio_0_194926.wav	And also because we have been using the same transistor parameters, in fact I didn't even mention that, as usual, Mion C	test
audio_0_103256.wav	But if a class has a pure virtual function, it is a abstract base class, what does that mean, what is abstract about this	test
audio_0_209080.wav	Then we can learn about Sketch Fillet, Sketch Chamfer	test
audio_0_200500.wav	So, our model will consist of GM VGS and we will continue to use GM of 200 microcemen, ignoring the 1 plus lambda VDS term but significantly we have a resistor here between these two or a conductance whose conductance is 10 microcemens or whose resistance is 100 kilo ooms	test
audio_0_200580.wav	So, this means that if VD is less than 0	test
audio_0_95470.wav	you read things of latest developments	test

audio_0_8316.wav	This is equation 77, right	test
audio_0_29252.wav	So, all these things you can do	test
audio_0_166404.wav	So, we will discuss the application of the transfer function when we will discuss the network stability and network synthesis concepts later in the course	test
audio_0_55840.wav	so from this edge, whenever drive clock goes from zero to one, this stage the starts calculating	test
audio_0_184448.wav	We wrote down a objective function, in terms of a Lagrangian	test
audio_0_79909.wav	This you can do again with simulation, and you can find it whetherif it makes sense or not, right	test
audio_0_202186.wav	This circle dimension supposed to be correct 20 mm in diameter	test
audio_0_158422.wav	So view serializable schedules which are not conflict serializable must have blind rights or this unconstraint rights	test

audio_0_207627.wav	We will check the front plane for this, top plane for this the pin and the top plane for the slot	test
audio_0_154429.wav	Because, traditionally this type of a handshake is associated with preexisting sincerity and honesty this also has become a favorite type of a handshake in the corporate sectors as well as in the political arena	test
audio_0_82142.wav	But the same time, what you learn here is what is safety; right	test
audio_0_238971.wav	So, helping people work in teams, and finding out, why if at all they are uncomfortable with working in teams, involvement in decision making, is another one	test
audio_0_91343.wav	So, it is half at the stroke length should be increased	test
audio_0_58561.wav	so we are interested to measure the power between time zero and capital t	test
audio_0_135228.wav	1 centimeters	test
audio_0_18292.wav	So, this is the diagram it says that before closing the switch this voltage v 1 here what you call 100 volt, and v 2 was 0 volt right capacitor this one is uncharged	test
audio_0_26345.wav	This is apparently something that we did not expect	test
audio_0_83210.wav	When is a generated operated in reverse breakdown model	test
audio_0_41180.wav	So, I had the substitution that k r is equal to x right the x is absorbed into it what is implicit over here was is a k is a constant right	test
audio_0_207132.wav	So, for example, we have this machine element; you can think of this one as a top cover of a motor	test
audio_0_121761.wav	So, it has two benefits there for Rauta	test
audio_0_131804.wav	so this is for a closed system or a system with a fixed mass	test
audio_0_156488.wav	So this course teacher book and the primary key is all of these together is a primary key and this if the MVD course to book exists then this relation can be broken down into this course teacher and course book	test
audio_0_91254.wav	25 and 0	test
audio_0_97206.wav	The remaining 38 operators that you have at hand, is rich enough to develop any kind of algebra, with any kind of matrix complex fraction any kind of types that you want to	test
audio_0_73908.wav	One would expect in circumstances where the cell is supposed to be strongly adherent as in this particular case, you not only have prominent focal adhesions all over the cell periphery, but you also have these adhesions which are pretty big in size	test
audio_0_55379.wav	similarly, between these two, these two region, the whole boundaries available, that is two others are all weight one	test
audio_0_97445.wav	Certainly the instantiation of the object, we will start by invoking the constructor of D	test
audio_0_213863.wav	what about memory	test
audio_0_57992.wav	so so here, what your saying is that we start with that graph which our partitioning algorithms is giving us some blocks and their interconnections, indicating their strength of connections	test
audio_0_93186.wav	let us have a conservative business suit or a dress of a natural woven blend fabric in a soft color ah which can in a way be intuin with the skin and the hair color ah	test
audio_0_209964.wav	And when it comes to front view, straight away the projection comes to XY line, because it is touching the point; so when you are projecting it, it goes on to that projection of that XY line and that point we usually denote it by h, a small h	test
audio_0_175079.wav	You are creating a new way of looking at things	test
audio_0_67006.wav	So, one needs to analyze this surface interactions very carefully and for surface analysis one of the most powerful tool	test
audio_0_148415.wav	So, this is the Graph API Explorer, which you will see in the tutorial in more detail but, it is essentially a through by browser you can actually look at the data, look at the JSON objects of the Facebook data of yourself, or whatever the Facebook API allows, which we will be able to see through this graph API	test
audio_0_76356.wav	And tenth domain of FN 3, it unfolds at a lower temperature	test
audio_0_143191.wav	Normally 2 and buy is written on debit and credit side	test
audio_0_175946.wav	We will presently identify those three levels	test
audio_0_82214.wav	Because my input signal, that is a signal or voltage at anode, is less than the voltage at cathode voltage at anode is less than the voltage at cathode ;, thatwhich means, my diode is reverse bias	test
audio_0_210077.wav	Now, one has to construct a surface, because these data points are scattered	test
audio_0_187426.wav	So, the new denominator has to be the total number of positive labels in the data	test
audio_0_43939.wav	So, you now know the field on those points ok	test
audio_0_189699.wav	You can also access the columns using the names of the column as we have seen in the data frames	test
audio_0_235954.wav	Which means, please do not do something, that can hurt me	test
audio_0_30837.wav	So, this is pretty much as far as this goes, this expression as you can see supposing I have another segment over here, it automatically takes care of everything right	test
audio_0_215697.wav	so mainly these setup parameters have to be fed to the tag and the tag will have to first	test
audio_0_65411.wav	well, most of the nets may be two terminal nets, that connects only two points	test
audio_0_63717.wav	this is the idea	test
audio_0_47317.wav	Let me get back to the overview slide	test
audio_0_149343.wav	And you get the entire data written in a JSON format	test
audio_0_72876.wav	In one month, some of the features from the product backlog are taken up, design, coded, tested, and once the sprint starts, the requirements that have been taken up are not allowed to change	test
audio_0_26971.wav	So, I get 1 into 100 into 1 in 100 steps, I just collapse this row and this column into a single entry that is like computing one entry in a matrix multiplication with the resulting thing is exactly that one entry	test
audio_0_43643.wav	So, what I have done is unknown vectors I have written as scalar unknown multiplied by a known vector field that is easier to solve that everything being unknown right	test
audio_0_188912.wav	So, this would be typical questions that that one might be interested in answering	test
audio_0_147881.wav	In the 2009 Hudson River, it was actually used for solving a problem, whereas in this case UK riots made worse by rolling news on Twitter and Facebook	test
audio_0_201542.wav	5 units and from here to here, we are going to show it as 4	test
audio_0_209389.wav	So, this length whatever that we are going to make it into 12 equal parts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ok we are right into 12 points the notation is this begins with P point all the way to 12	test
audio_0_220769.wav	So, one of the important criteria that we should not forget is that, sorting often happens in phases	test
audio_0_4091.wav	Put all these values you will get i t is equal to 4 into 1 minus e the power minus 2 t ampere that is in between 0 ah and 4 second because switch S 1 is closed right now for t greater than 4 second	test
audio_0_236162.wav	And moralities, context dependent, and subjective	test
audio_0_203028.wav	And this left over portion we will see it in the top view in that way	test
audio_0_9135.wav	So, let me clear it same is for the figure 1	test
audio_0_188165.wav	What does this structure function do, structure function compactly display the internal structure of an R object	test
audio_0_64650.wav	number one, the partitions need to be approximately of the same size, and number two, the number of connections between the partitions has to be approximately equal	test
audio_0_180785.wav	8 gamma	test
audio_0_122022.wav	The first point that I've put on this slide is the story time and the other is the discourse time	test
audio_0_57226.wav	because of this there will be additional transitions, additional charging and discharging taking place, or the load capacitor, so this means additional power dissipation	test
audio_0_115196.wav	it should be ah financially beneficial to the both provider and consumer	test
audio_0_229135.wav	I will also like to work on the control charts in excel M	test
audio_0_109854.wav	So, that we are done and written it here, what is the reflection coefficient that we are looking at from the input port of the quarter wave transformer that is the calling the gamma in, you see this is mathematics this will be easy to understand and we are considering that we are not at a designing frequency	test
audio_0_62624.wav	but the trouble is that getting the minimum length steiner tree is computational difficult	test
audio_0_211750.wav	i said four, fifty and it went to um four hundred and roughly four hundred and sixty four and went back to four, fifty five and in this result, ah, we are, we are getting different values	test
audio_0_67426.wav	the different set of problems is these glial cells are, i told you in the previously, these are dividing cells	test
audio_0_43287.wav	There is another slightly confusing shorthand notation for it which goes like this	test
audio_0_37808.wav	So, there was there was this was a plus sign over here right	test
audio_0_220852.wav	So, now we look and we have got 44 here and now we have to check whether it violates anything with its parent, and it does	test
audio_0_192280.wav	It is closed under addition multiplication and so on it is an abelian group under addition and multiplication is associative and so on	test

audio_0_35718.wav	In the second term over here what is the sign over here plus why because I am using the same n hat and for volume V 2 this is an	test
audio_0_219384.wav	For instance if you use a service like Google Maps and you say that you want to go from a source or a destination it will try to compute the shortest path and give you the time in terms of walking driving etc so we have two different types of problems one where we have the single source and we want the shortest path to every destination but only from that source and another version where we want to find the shortest part between every pair of vertices so we will begin by looking at the single source shortest path problem so we have So, we have to designate in such a problem what is the start vertex	test
audio_0_8976.wav	So, if you apply KCL at this point it will be your ah your what you call this current is also leaving this current is also leaving this current is also leaving the node	test
audio_0_183723.wav	Except for that all the other 4 states represented by 4 bits	test
audio_0_235237.wav	Core plus option plans, consists of a core of essential benefits, health benefits, child care, family care, and either, vacation, or education, or training, or discounts, etcetera	test

audio_0_112653.wav	See this diagram you are to give move towards load by an amount 0	test
audio_0_100339.wav	So, this is what I have, this is my s 1, this is my string, my s 1 is football	test
audio_0_180614.wav	Because that means, that that component is starting to become more dominant with respect to the others there is yes presence of signal in the other angles as well	test
audio_0_204464.wav	This is the way one will be in a position to construct it	test
audio_0_195695.wav	What we want to do now is to figure out what is the equivalent of a two port non linearity	test
audio_0_122868.wav	So, this excerpt tells us that, you are a bit of all right old chap, it said	test
audio_0_17154.wav	So, if you apply KCL at node 1, look this i o[ne] this ah i 1 current and i 2 current and one ampere current all are leaving this node	test
audio_0_201282.wav	As usual, at this point I would like you to pause the video and try to sketch the characteristics yourselves, okay, for the constant values I have given and after that you can compare it to what I draw here okay so that will give you practice in doing these things correctly so VGS this is in volts so let's say one two, 4 and so on	test
audio_0_68372.wav	the only difference is now you are adding sodium bicarbonate	test
audio_0_238883.wav	You have come with a specific set of skills, please remain distinct	test
audio_0_59204.wav	now for such a block, you know that the resistance from one end to the other is given by an equation like this: rho is the constant called the resistivity	test
audio_0_162667.wav	So, J not omega minus 2 J2 omega cos 2 phi minus phi dash minus J4 omega cos 4 phi minus phi dashed etc	test
audio_0_46479.wav	If you are not able to get it then bring it up in the forum and I will discuss that once again	test
audio_0_76513.wav	So, fibronectin is known to bind to multiple ECM proteins including collagen	test
audio_0_193334.wav	So, in the next 1 or 2 videos I will do some problems on rings just to summarize whatever we have done and then we will go to fields	test
audio_0_147029.wav	Total degree of a graph is calculated by summing the in degree and out degree	test
audio_0_169602.wav	Now, why we are interested in sinusoids	test
audio_0_102274.wav	In C++ particularly note that in C, you will really need to know what is the size of the result	test
audio_0_187052.wav	On the other hand if both these quantities if the interval is to the left of 0 which is completely negative or to the right of 0 which means both these quantities are positive, then this interval will not contain 0 and then we can make the conclusion reject the null hypothesis at beta 1 equal is 0 which means beta 1 is significant	test
audio_0_41879.wav	So, if I say d by dt, what should I get	test
audio_0_167082.wav	At the same time you can represent the block as an algebraical function	test
audio_0_206248.wav	Anyone can go with any either of them	test
audio_0_123991.wav	thats why i use them like this	test
audio_0_79547.wav	So, this cantilever, so at the back of it, the back surface of the cantilever is shiny and you have a laser light which reflects of its back and gets detected in a photo detector	test
audio_0_207978.wav	If we remove this entire part; then we have material within that portion	test
audio_0_113297.wav	So, 6 unknowns are there in the S matrix	test
audio_0_80280.wav	Then we have seen some discrete components and finally, we have seen a breadboard	test
audio_0_165960.wav	So for the Ra you will get R1 R2 plus R2 R3 plus R3 R1 divided by R1	test
audio_0_207266.wav	If we are interested in constructing a new drawing, the first part what we have to do is go to this new option, click means left button click, part by clicking that, then OK	test
audio_0_42855.wav	So, this so this will become minus j omega B minus M dot ds ok	test
audio_0_207420.wav	Now, once center is constructed from any point of that, you are going to draw a circle	test
audio_0_131526.wav	its said hundred bar and it is cooled down by this heat exchanger and we are assuming that it will cool down to the original temperature, twenty degree centigrade	test
audio_0_114731.wav	what they need, determine dom zero address for each, each pair of a, b	test
audio_0_20459.wav	But in real life, most of the costs do change with level of activity	test
audio_0_152112.wav	There is also communication privacy which is telephones and other forms of communication	test
audio_0_191561.wav	And similarly converse is also true actually you can just go back everywhere, if alpha is in F x minus alpha is in F x minus alpha is a polynomial which has alpha is a root and degree cannot be anything smaller	test
audio_0_112587.wav	The point is actually we have already seen that if we reflect any impedance point 180 degree in the smith chart we get an admittance point	test
audio_0_52132.wav	I can also ask, what is mass percent unit area, per unit time, flowing through any cross section here or a cross section here and that is what called current, which give me the direction of flow as well as the amount that fluid flowing	test
audio_0_225700.wav	It is important to know how to prove such an algorithm is correct	test
audio_0_5086.wav	So, now this is your , KVA and right 123	test
audio_0_77113.wav	If you anchor it to the substrate the source of this tension is actomyosin contractility	test
audio_0_97234.wav	Now of course, if we have the convenience of implicit conversion then why do we have explicit conversion	test
audio_0_199859.wav	And just as in the case of the source follower, this appears more convenient because the source terminal of the mouse transistor is not connected to ground in the signal picture, whereas here it is connected to ground	test
audio_0_83292.wav	So, we have taken two problems in which we have solved the differential amplifier right	test
audio_0_62161.wav	so this is just a very simple example i have given, but here we shall be looking at much more delay, ah, delay related issues and other problems there in in our next modules, where we discussed these things in detail	test
audio_0_76772.wav	So, having said that	test
audio_0_72749.wav	At the beginning we had said that the type of projects that are undertaken have undergone a drastic change over the years	test
audio_0_12119.wav	This is actually is equal to R e 2 per unit right and unity power factor load so, cos phi is equal to 1 right	test
audio_0_192963.wav	So, let us take an arbitrary element x in G	test
audio_0_101143.wav	That is the basic concept of a reference	test
audio_0_39189.wav	In the second one it is also outside and it is a first kind	test
audio_0_100587.wav	And as we go along, different features and different programming examples will keep on highlighting that the choice has to be judicious and right for you to become an efficient C++ programmer	test
audio_0_46612.wav	One is the average ID average and the ID maximum	test
audio_0_83683.wav	So, what is Ad	test
audio_0_214000.wav	ok, now you can replace this part, this part here, this part here, with a potentiometer, a variable resistor, you could denote it with a variable resistor	test
audio_0_220959.wav	We can add a memory card and increase the memory	test
audio_0_152919.wav	Dropping of fingers is always a negative gesture and therefore, it should be avoided in all of our professional settings	test
audio_0_100330.wav	Now, lets us look into a very small, but dangerous issue with the code that we have already seen	test
audio_0_1711.wav	Next is next is your plus; this dependent source plus 2 I plus 2 I means that I is equal to your earlier I said that I is equal to your i 1 minus i 2 right because this is the I this is I I said earlier and this is 2 i; that means, 2 i 1 dependent source 2 i 1 minus i 2	test
audio_0_81767.wav	Now what you will see you will see how we can measure the voltage or what is a voltage right now, all right	test
audio_0_6924.wav	So, if the current flows from a higher potential to lower potential v is equal to iR, but if it is current flows from a lower potential to higher potential, v will be is equal to minus iR; that means, your that means, let me let me just for your understanding	test
audio_0_30533.wav	Now if water were for example, in this surface over here if water was flowing like this along the surface would it; obviously, not flow out	test
audio_0_82962.wav	And you have applied voltage at the non inverting terminal one volt peak to peak	test
audio_0_185966.wav	So, we go back to the previous slide and when I was discussing this slide and explaining how equality constraints affect the optimum solution	test
audio_0_14713.wav	For R N, you will get your 2 ohm, R N will become your	test
audio_0_144662.wav	Then from corporate governance we have also discussed about evolution of accounting, how accounting is related to Diwali, how various shranny types of organizations existed in ancient India	test
audio_0_91902.wav	So this is analytic and the Cauchy integral theorem can be used here to and the first one we have use the Cauchy integral formula and second one we can use the Cauchy theorem, so which says that this plus this 0 and the total answer we have 2 pi i	test
audio_0_43365.wav	If they are different, make sure that you subtract them by the correct amount ok	test
audio_0_79641.wav	So, what you are measuring is the cortical stiffness of your cell	test
audio_0_167160.wav	First is Loop gain, so loop gain is the product of branch gains formed by traversing the path that starts at a node and ends at the same node without passing through any other node more than once and following the direction of the signal flow	test
audio_0_164457.wav	Branch represents a single element such as voltage source or a resistor	test
audio_0_152718.wav	Growing up	test
audio_0_43807.wav	But if I want to get the complete solution, there is no escape I have to go to the origin now ok	test
audio_0_52661.wav	so i have this black address charge and up to a distance ct and little beyond that	test
audio_0_93174.wav	but in our country, ah, many people feel that they should wear rings	test
audio_0_152045.wav	So, this basically shows that even though the users are increasing, which means the posts should be increasing, the engagement should be increasing	test
audio_0_120701.wav	So, we get further study in contrast in this story in relation to the picnic	test
audio_0_71596.wav	Management, the project manager can have a strong control, put schedule, milestones and monitor	test
audio_0_83144.wav	So, when we talk about thermal noise right, it is noise created by the motion of the carriers	test
audio_0_37456.wav	So, that is transmitting case, in the receiving case what happens if this is my antenna what is happening some E incident is falling on it on this antenna, what will that E incident do	test
audio_0_171675.wav	Time is given as 10 seconds	test
audio_0_130076.wav	One of the most important principles in electronic spectroscopy is that when a molecule is electronically excited from one state to the other, there is very little time for the molecular geometry to change during the transition	test
audio_0_56259.wav	we introduce this earlier in the last lecture, but let me reintroduce them again	test
audio_0_223631.wav	So, we have i 1 to i n by 2 which is the left and i n by 2 plus 1 to n which is the right	test
audio_0_97220.wav	Ending with the dynamic casting scenarios, where casting is done based on the runtime type; and for that we will discuss another additional type id operator	test
audio_0_94874.wav	suppose, as a speaker and speaking and i do not look at you, you do not feel well	test
audio_0_75635.wav	So, what this suggests is that the wall is only 10 delta away from the back wall, while it takes the filament has to be 100 delta in length before a new branch can form ok	test
audio_0_116133.wav	so today we will talk about ah basics of mobile cloud computing	test
audio_0_174678.wav	So what happens is you have to again hierarchically further detail how do you conduct these 12 sessions	test
audio_0_169418.wav	Similarly for inductor 2 also we will write 1 upon L2 t0 to t vdt plus the initial current flowing in the inductor and when we will sum up all the elements, we can simply write 1 upon L1 plus 1 upon L2 plus Ln because these are the constant quantities and we can take it out	test
audio_0_230391.wav	Just giving an example, this is this is again a 30 degree block, and then what you do is you try to have in reverse direction, so in reverse direction, and then you try it here what will be the angle is here it is only 25 degrees	test
audio_0_200247.wav	For now I will assume that it is a resistance that I can connect in that fashion	test
audio_0_80080.wav	You can see the circuit which is shown here, circuit which is shown here right and the signal that we are applying is to the low pass and high pass filter you can see here correct	test
audio_0_32595.wav	So, let us start with trying to put all these singular integrals to work over here	test
audio_0_151438.wav	And then answers could be done in many ways	test
audio_0_143709.wav	So, 28 upon 60, the gross margin is 46	test
audio_0_82502.wav	So, if I see this particular plot, but I see there is a source; there is a channel, there is a drain	test
audio_0_99255.wav	So, let us take a look at reversing a string	test
audio_0_208212.wav	Now, 45 degrees inclination we have to find it on XY from point a	test
audio_0_136248.wav	And though Moorthy tries to convince the villagers that the White man is exploiting them economically, for the villagers the more real face of economic exploitation is the Moneylender Bhatta for instance	test
audio_0_56500.wav	this solid blue region indicates dont care random bits	test
audio_0_57589.wav	this capacitance, this is u times larger	test
audio_0_213872.wav	how should this power supply block be designed in a manner that it is able to provide stable power to this complete block, not just the complete block, but also the other blocks to which this power supply, this system, this system is actually connected to, right, for example, sensors, sensors which are connected to the ah a dc block	test
audio_0_111149.wav	25, c is 9	test
audio_0_94754.wav	now, when you detail your experience, ah, dont tell employers your qualifications	test
audio_0_224891.wav	So, we have to first identify this sub tree, so how do we identify the sub tree, will be walk up and find out how this sub tree is connected	test
audio_0_166733.wav	Let us see this particular figure where we have V1 andV2 2 voltages applied across the 2 coils which are placed nearby, so these two are magnetically coupled	test
audio_0_31411.wav	Switching yeah switches yeah ok	test
audio_0_83062.wav	So, do not give up, try to understand the series, try to understand what experiments we have done, try to understand the characteristics of the operational amplifier, and I am sure that you will understand more when you do it by yourself, alright	test
audio_0_159865.wav	So that means L3 is concerned only about E1	test
audio_0_52450.wav	so let me look at the x y plane	test
audio_0_102925.wav	But there is a significant difference in terms of the fact that if there are say global objects which have been created initialized, there are local objects which have been initialized, and you are at a point where you want to basically terminate an exit	test
audio_0_30644.wav	It is an open surface right; it is not the circle is not around it	test
audio_0_46676.wav	Now to do that we need to have a controller and feedback the output voltage and the controller should take a decision based on the error and accordingly change the duty cycle which is actually the control input for the for most of the controllers now most of the DCDC converters so in order to do this regulation V 0 is fed back and compared with the reference and passed on to a controller which could be a proportional or proportional integral or a PID proportional integral derivative type of controller and the output of which goes to a PWM modulator pulse width modulator and eventually to the gate drive and the switch the switch the controllable switch which we have used till now in almost all of our open loop DCDC converters so this would be the plan while closing the loop so in this section of the video lecture I would I will try to focus on closed looping the converters so I will take examples I will take examples like the buck converter the boost converter and try to close the loop in a negative feedback way and then see how the controller works and then probably we can look at some simulation examples so that you get some practice on how to go about doing the closed loop operation of DCDC converters and same concept similar concept can be applied even to the isolated converters and other DCDC open loop converters which you may encounter in future let us discuss the closed loop operation of the buck converter the process is similar even if it is for any other type of converter	test
audio_0_54757.wav	the third example i am going to do again i'll come back to over stand at problem of sphere made of a material of chi m magnetic moment put in a uniform field from outside	test
audio_0_55786.wav	so if the clocking and delays are not absolutely synchronized there will be problem	test
audio_0_119512.wav	disk space management layer: ah, this another property that stores data records on pages of contiguous memory block so that the ah disk movement is minimized	test
audio_0_204672.wav	And axis is inclined to that horizontal plane which we can sense it only in the front view	test
audio_0_181092.wav	So, basically you will get 2 times root 3 by 2 R which give me root 3 R and again that is a very useful point to remember because whenever we tessellate we are looking at distance between the centers and usually in cellular geometry discussions R is a parameter that you will have to choose that will be based on the size of the cell, but for a lot of discussions we assume that we can choose R to be anything	test
audio_0_164665.wav	So we will say the impedance of the load is Z Y in all three phases	test
audio_0_222369.wav	Then this process starting from 1 would have left 11, 12, 13 and 14 marked as unvisited	test
audio_0_37653.wav	So, this is also integrated over e 1 what kind of what polynomial is this is it constant linear quadratic	test
audio_0_92175.wav	So, the derivative of r divided by its magnitude will give the unit tangent vector and the ds this arc length we have also learned in the very first lecture that the absolute value of this or the magnitude of this r prime t will give and multiplied by dt that is the element here this ds we can express	test
audio_0_69856.wav	There are people who recommends thicker band, but over the years I have realized that that really does not work and you spin it once you spin it what will happen depending on the density of the cell they will settle down at different density zones	test
audio_0_75605.wav	97 f0	test
audio_0_59764.wav	now this gate is providing a delay of one	test
audio_0_65774.wav	So, today we are into the fifth lecture of the second week	test
audio_0_38577.wav	From a circuit from an antenna or a circuit designers point of view what is the impedance that he or she needs to match, is it Z 1 1, Z 2 2 or what	test
audio_0_49335.wav	so current density, which is j r, is given by sigma, means whatever density is there, sigma into v r	test
audio_0_41962.wav	Now there are some very beautiful geometric meanings of what these quantities are	test
audio_0_13092.wav	4 your 0	test
audio_0_99327.wav	In the right hand side, we have exactly the same code except that we have introduced this in the class, much in the way we define the member function but with the difference that this is this inclusion is prefixed by a keyword friend	test
audio_0_185108.wav	The right strategy seems to be give more power to the good channel, but also use the bad channel	test
audio_0_19419.wav	Bus rent permit though I have entered will not be included in fixed cost, it will rather be included in semi variable cost which changes per bus, not per student	test
audio_0_146958.wav	We looked at analysis of tasks to see whether they can be scheduled on a processor, looked at resource sharing issues, and then we looked at multiprocessor scheduling, and then finally we have been looking at some issues that a real time operating system needs to support the traditional operating systems lack support for that	test
audio_0_76612.wav	So, in our case of protein unfolding, let us say I have a surface, if I were to let us say I draw it like this I have a surface and I have the protein which is anchored at some point	test
audio_0_215548.wav	ok, before we go into polarization, lets talk about gain	test
audio_0_27263.wav	Now, let us open the python interpreter and try to read lines from this file and print it out	test
audio_0_69042.wav	It something become like this and if you take the AFM tip to do a surface analysis then what you will see something like this, it is a very kind of you know rough surface, upon surface analysis and they are exposed	test
audio_0_68716.wav	So, whatever divides here they move like this layer by layer them move and then they come to the uppermost layer	test
audio_0_161383.wav	That can fit in a single disk page	test
audio_0_94220.wav	so when you participated in a debate, you had ah prepared your topic very well	test
audio_0_165463.wav	So, the roots of the characteristic equation which we just discuss are refer to as the eigenvalues of the matrix A	test
audio_0_116141.wav	if the application is heavy, ah, that is, ah, more require more resource to execute this, or what we say resource hungry applications, right	test
audio_0_72316.wav	The third quadrant is developed and validate and the fourth quadrant is give the developed solution to the customer for feedback and plan for the next iteration	test
audio_0_66412.wav	So, while talking about it I highlighted upon the first point is, what is the objective of setting up the lab	test
audio_0_41139.wav	all of you know that we can simplify we can get rid of this mu naught epsilon and write it in terms of speed of light and that speed of light can get converted into a wave number k 2 pi by lambda right	test
audio_0_155339.wav	These stereotypes are widely held not only by men, but also interestingly by women and both react towards others on the basis of these stereotypes	test
audio_0_151496.wav	In the same way in the likes also the Cc which is comments by citizens only if the post comes from police is actually higher compared to the comments by police and citizens	test
audio_0_16872.wav	When that now there write up is there is just when the whatever I said when the transformer is loaded a current I 2 will flow in the secondary winding	test
audio_0_227343.wav	So, that derives the equation 3, with this we can find the sensitivity of the of our spirit level	test
audio_0_207657.wav	In three dimension we can easily see that if we are looking from this view, this entire line coincides and we will see a vertical line,we see a horizontal line in the front view	test
audio_0_43374.wav	The reason we cannot independently solve it is this green triangle has edges belonging to the set 1 and set 2	test
audio_0_168822.wav	So, if you put this switch to this side then after that switching event the circuit will become this	test
audio_0_94275.wav	why unstructured	test
audio_0_127155.wav	so this is plus one by k times v test	test
audio_0_89495.wav	So the stack is at this particular time pointing to this location and therefore the address of this particular gadget return is loaded into the edi register and at the same time as we know the pop would increment the stack pointer to be pointing to this location	test
audio_0_209351.wav	So, 1 line from there we draw a parallel line similarly from point 2 we are going to draw a parallel line from 3 4 5 6 again from 7 8 and so on we repeat all the way to this point P	test
audio_0_103202.wav	So, it has to go to class B and decide that what destructor should be called it knows there is a destructor and it finds that this destructor is non virtual	test
audio_0_82464.wav	Now derivation of 1 is 0 and my d by d V G S of V G S by V p will be minus 1 by V p	test
audio_0_32262.wav	At least continuous; previously if you remember when we had done the pulse functions what will what did we do	test
audio_0_46342.wav	And we know that this is V0 value because when the transistor is off, diode is conducting and V0 point and the VP point are same	test
audio_0_160601.wav	Also, if the query or the join, if the query generally, if the query touches multiple attributes, then it is also not faster	test
audio_0_230109.wav	So, this is y R this is y A y B and this is y R	test
audio_0_109883.wav	Only thing is generally we do not express the frequency response in terms of electrical length	test
audio_0_111295.wav	So, Thru Reflect is line in; now what is Thru	test
audio_0_47079.wav	In the symbols folder there are three subfolders	test
audio_0_210920.wav	So, we will have that	test
audio_0_165106.wav	So, today we will discuss about the Nodal Analysis	test
audio_0_50849.wav	notice that i am taking the distance to be r because i'll be moving the image charge at from r naught to infinity and q prime is at a distance which is equal to q prime is at a distance d, which is equal to r square over r	test
audio_0_181548.wav	We will talk about that in the next lecture that is part of the cellular design	test
audio_0_155222.wav	This understanding helps us to avoid hasty conclusions	test
audio_0_4626.wav	So, this is the circuit, this is your circuit	test
audio_0_150278.wav	Now, do not change the root password because you have already set it	test
audio_0_72952.wav	So here you can see that project 3 where the organization receives the original or the initial funding it is during year four	test
audio_0_133615.wav	For example, you are thirsty or you are not thirsty, but then in the case of Metaneeds, in the case of the being values self actualization you realize that all of them are equally important and the rather only vary in terms of their degree and of course, on the of the humbling preposition was that no human being is actually perfectly self actualized	test
audio_0_175293.wav	And there are 6 COs and this is how we have written	test
audio_0_81602.wav	So, he is applying signal, and you will connect this ground which is black 1 to the ground of the circuit, that is on the pc on the breadboard, alright	test
audio_0_109200.wav	So, that is another rationale for having a regime because you had to protect the expression of ideas from being stolen	test
audio_0_75983.wav	So, all these kinds of suggests that force, actomyosin contractile force is stabilizing the focal adhesions	test
audio_0_44666.wav	5 volts and you will call this one as we see are the control voltage that you would give for the P	test
audio_0_209848.wav	So, for that to identify that we we are locating this entire thing as a locus	test
audio_0_118353.wav	so performance and of cloud, cloud systems and applications is a another major issue, like how to measure performance, how to ah, um, basically ah, maintain that performance at particular level of performance and with, with, with proper resource management, cloud availability and reliability	test
audio_0_113239.wav	So, instead of 3 port if we open up another port obviously; that means, we are having more electronics circuitry	test
audio_0_96421.wav	then comes cordiality	test
audio_0_39249.wav	So, I know that if I just write integral of d f from a to b right; if you did not know anything else, you would simply write this as the value of the function at in this way fb minus fa right	test
audio_0_98878.wav	Certainly, in this part of the code, if you look carefully all the time doing is I have just stopped the order in which they are invoked; s1 and s2, and the result become different	test
audio_0_229079.wav	Good morning, welcome back to the course on Engineering Metrology and we are in the last week of this course	test
audio_0_170314.wav	So when we were discussing the RLC circuits we saw that there were differential equations compiled and we were trying to solve those differential equation	test
audio_0_32146.wav	What is going to look like	test
audio_0_208282.wav	So, let us begin that on our drawing sheet	test
audio_0_183289.wav	Now, we find that in any practical antenna you will find that the radiation will extend beyond the main beam width and of course, we would also there may be also be some side lobes, now radiation outside of the main beam width and the side lobes are undesirable and we would like to keep that as small as possible to get the maximum amount of radiation in the direction of interest	test
audio_0_94928.wav	now it is, of course, is this is an age where people love to have ppt presentations	test
audio_0_230476.wav	Reflection is used	test
audio_0_12075.wav	So, it is T by 2 minus 0	test
audio_0_147257.wav	This came out on Twitter and they said that we can actually post the pictures on our Facebook account	test
audio_0_153267.wav	In the 18th and 19th centuries we find that the European elocution movement also emphasized on the body movements and vocalizations	test
audio_0_184976.wav	How do we build it up into a concept that we can work with	test
audio_0_206754.wav	So, you can see here the 120 degrees, 120 degrees and 120 degrees which serves as principal axis of the system	test
audio_0_36829.wav	The other term for it is I mean the other kind of imaging modality is bi static where you can have like I drew above over here	test
audio_0_237288.wav	And, it also helps the employees, stay committed, stay interested, in working for the organization	test
audio_0_103251.wav	So, for that a new notion is introduced which is call the pure virtual function	test
audio_0_207847.wav	So, this is one of thereasons	test
audio_0_192506.wav	Given two elements of R there is a single element R which when you subtract a, it is in I and from the same element when you subtract b it is in J	test
audio_0_205924.wav	These are never ending lines which supposed to go, at least for that short span of that road	test
audio_0_238773.wav	Others will probably, let the subordinates, know that, they have arrived in the office	test
audio_0_129157.wav	Now, what is an electrical circuit, it is basically an interconnection of elements such that there is at least one loop of elements	test
audio_0_7091.wav	So, the here also it is v square i square, here I mean G is taken positive it is reciprocal of resistance	test
audio_0_82742.wav	Not from the just that you can see the frequency of the input and output similar that is not the case	test
audio_0_50929.wav	now we are going to use result that zero to infinity, r raise to n e raise to minus alpha r d r is equal to n factorial over alpha raise to n plus one and that when applied to let me write this term by term work done is equal to four pi rho zero square over epsilon zero	test
audio_0_192347.wav	For example, if n equal to 1 you get the 0 ring that I discussed earlier right	test
audio_0_185309.wav	Similarly, Zi of t you can by the same argument both of these will be 0	test
audio_0_181719.wav	So, here is way by which we can achieve the finite integration	test
audio_0_79658.wav	So, you found EB equal to EA, can this be possible	test
audio_0_226103.wav	Screw thread micrometer generally what we do is we take a screw thread micrometer and here we have a fixed one and here we have a moving one	test
audio_0_191399.wav	So, we have the other inclusion always holds	test
audio_0_19893.wav	See, operating costs are likely to grow by 10 to 12%	test
audio_0_60161.wav	these all will be labeled as s one, s one, s one, s one, s one and s one	test
audio_0_228182.wav	So, next I am trying to generate the platform to measure the features of the object	test
audio_0_146940.wav	So we just right now saw some issues if we want to use the traditional operating systems in real time applications	test
audio_0_220273.wav	So, now we are interested in this smaller or these two, because the smaller are these two is a candidate for the overall minimum distance	test
audio_0_186569.wav	Now, we kept talking about finding the number of clusters	test
audio_0_43833.wav	Now, off these when I this convolution will have 3 integrals xyz; x y will pop out right I will only be left with z right	test
audio_0_34847.wav	So, if I did for example, ds over here	test
audio_0_133280.wav	Now release of epinephrine or norepinephrine it accompanies many emotional states	test
audio_0_176237.wav	That you are just keep on analyzing facts and figures in the classroom	test
audio_0_145680.wav	So, we will see what is an embedded system and what is a safety critical system	test
audio_0_76711.wav	So, what this suggests is this particular A is partly unstructured plus partly folded	test
audio_0_42826.wav	So, infinitely conductive material right; so, in a like we take a perfect electric conductor and ask you where is the current on the conductor, in how much thickness is it in, what would you say	test
audio_0_35482.wav	So, use FEM for the interior objects and use	test
audio_0_202510.wav	Perhaps if that thread is very large perhaps it might not really fit into that object also	test
audio_0_320.wav	So, in that case that you have to what you call just I told it passes through the neutral axis	test
audio_0_58347.wav	now this table shows you the result of a test pattern generation program	test
audio_0_182746.wav	The same phase difference if you were to rewrite it in the form that is given	test
audio_0_150299.wav	Let us create a database to store data using the command, create database osn data	test
audio_0_88430.wav	The first thing that main would do is to push the parameters N and M onto the stack and then it would call the fact function, the call instruction would automatically push the return address onto the stack	test
audio_0_80696.wav	So, this is how I can see the change	test
audio_0_32513.wav	Louder	test
audio_0_39924.wav	And remember, how did this thing come	test
audio_0_231190.wav	So, here there is an important terminology which is called as calibration which comes into existence	test
audio_0_231657.wav	Eighth one, They have received no informations; wrong to use informations, right form: They have received no information	test
audio_0_228636.wav	How would the errors behave in this case	test
audio_0_153901.wav	One of the greatest things, I found in my research is that if you send a thank you e mail within a few minutes or an hour of the meeting versus a few days or week later there is a significant difference in how people feel connected to that thank you	test
audio_0_46289.wav	So it will be a buck converter	test
audio_0_201973.wav	And we will click ok	test
audio_0_6963.wav	So, that means, when I R tends to infinity limit b by R will be 0, right	test
audio_0_9966.wav	It is understandable to you	test
audio_0_27548.wav	So, this particular thing here is the place where we create this, swap the pointers so that what self points to does not change, but rather we create a reordering of the new node and the first node	test
audio_0_157053.wav	So you see that these set operations etc	test
audio_0_182035.wav	That means, this encoder gamma n encoder decoder pair will achieve highest capacity, highest capacity and of course, the on the other end this will be the lowest capacity, but the idea is that you still use the channels whenever it is possible and water filling tells you that go ahead and use it, but you use it in a judicious manner only allocating their amount of power that will achieved	test
audio_0_371.wav	So, if you look into that a separately excited means the field actually is given a different your supply right	test
audio_0_10262.wav	So, input is equal to then x into P f l the output plus W i the core loss or iron loss we call right, this W i you call iron loss or core loss plus x square W c so, this is equation 5	test
audio_0_229952.wav	Good instruments are designed to minimize the load effect	test
audio_0_221370.wav	So, I get 6 choose 2	test
audio_0_152685.wav	There are situations when the movement of hand can reinforce our meaning or negated at moments	test
audio_0_180462.wav	So, therefore, there is no inter symbol interference	test
audio_0_151042.wav	It could be the same post at the same time and for both accounts	test
audio_0_217523.wav	nmos is low as compared to, as compared to to a pmos, but we it is also always a good idea	test
audio_0_222101.wav	So, at this point upper limit is here	test
audio_0_170078.wav	We say that the direction of motion is in this direction that is y t and force is f t	test
audio_0_123016.wav	I was enjoying the warmth of a strip of morning sun that had alighted on my feet under the table, travelling through the glass window	test
audio_0_147683.wav	Since, it is a two hop network of my own twitter data, therefore the in degree would signify that these are the accounts which are most followed in my two hop twitter network	test
audio_0_93486.wav	you are advised to submit your report, again passive	test
audio_0_131731.wav	ok, so this is what i am showing here from professor amir faugury, who is a well known authority on heat, on heat pipes, and this is in his book	test
audio_0_186032.wav	So, we can see that the names of the variables you have created are taken as columns and the entries in the each column are of the same data type; this is the condition which you need to be satisfying while creating a data frame	test
audio_0_139057.wav	Now, so exactly this is what happens, so now you see, if you, if you put the integrator what happens, is very interesting, so what happens is that, this bias input which was previously coming now comes automatically, that is the integral output which I was talking about now increases, increases, increases, still it can, then it goes to zero and then if you, if you change the set point again from here to here again some error will be created	test
audio_0_184173.wav	So, 5 G as we mentioned the goal is to give enough bandwidth so that the user has a perception of infinite capacity	test
audio_0_214593.wav	if you take cortex m four, it has eight bit s i m d	test
audio_0_60499.wav	so my functions will be like this: a bar, b or a b	test
audio_0_174609.wav	In that case that course obviously will address PO 11	test
audio_0_158469.wav	So these are the assumptions that we will go over that we will assume for all the algorithms	test
audio_0_172904.wav	That means instead of 60 I can make it 65	test
audio_0_234885.wav	We all have family needs	test
audio_0_18975.wav	So, figures 50 determine the indicated voltages and current at t is equal to 0 plus immediately after the switch closes also, find these voltages and current a long time after the switch closes given that capacitors are initially uncharged	test
audio_0_18189.wav	Now when t is equal to 2 suppose when t is equal to 2 second right then this your i t is t is equal 2 is equal to it will be minus 40 because e to the power 0 it will become when you put 2, it will be minus 40 micro ampere at t is equal to 2 right	test
audio_0_221279.wav	So, Floyd Warshall as you can see from the hyphenation, as the hybrid name for this algorithm and actually there are two distinct algorithms which comprise it, which have a very similar structure	test
audio_0_231823.wav	You will need a umbrella, wrong form	test
audio_0_32006.wav	In fact, in the strictest sense these equations that I have written a wrong and we will correct them as we go further in the course this	test
audio_0_217865.wav	indeed, it is a fact that filtering is a very nice thing in the broker	test
audio_0_121638.wav	She stuffed the calculator into his hands	test
audio_0_207302.wav	But there is an object straight forwardly available as straight slot; so, we are using that, then press escape	test
audio_0_159701.wav	And now we see, let us say, what is the idea of atomicity	test
audio_0_189772.wav	But if you want to have a regular matrix multiplication you have to use percentage symbol before and after this hash trick that will perform the regular matrix operation	test
audio_0_198791.wav	So that is another common source amplifier and you can bias a whole bunch of common source amplifiers with this constant current derived biasing using a current mirror	test
audio_0_175888.wav	That kind of freedom is permitted by National Board Of Accreditation when it looks at a particular college will also ask what kind of their interpretation of the curriculum is performed by the a particular department vis à vis the course outcomes	test
audio_0_146003.wav	If you would have noticed in all our examples so far we consider the task period and deadline to be the same	test
audio_0_72706.wav	It says that a software project that does not have to meet a reliability requirement can meet any other requirement	test
audio_0_186955.wav	However, we can prove based on the assumption we have made regarding the errors that the expected value of beta naught hat will be equal to beta naught	test
audio_0_42330.wav	Is this constant or is it a variable as a function of x it is what is this argument x i	test
audio_0_60185.wav	so you try to find out escape point and escape line and you draw the perpendicular lines only at the escape points	test
audio_0_184412.wav	So, this problem is called, particularly in the context of is called the near far problem	test
audio_0_55094.wav	of course, i said that most of the circuits today are based on standard cells, floorplanning and placement arriving the identical in those cases	test
audio_0_51379.wav	the moment you match the impedance or refractive index or velocities of the two mediums	test
audio_0_107957.wav	Now, a trader when he uses a mark, the trader signifies that the goods are from his enterprise	test
audio_0_71261.wav	So, here the important is anonymity	test
audio_0_78167.wav	So, is it that some factors are released which triggered the migration of these cells and or is it that it is just the availability of space is the signal which triggers migrations of cells	test
audio_0_135887.wav	But I have also tried, while listing these plot points chronologically, I have also tried to introduce a thematic pattern into these points	test
audio_0_30472.wav	And the notation for that is we can put usually a path that is denoted by some symbol	test
audio_0_132508.wav	the water that is available to us in winter is at a lower temperature, around fifteen degree centigrade, which is not comfortable for a swimming pool	test
audio_0_142317.wav	The cases will be available to you on the Google link but right now I am showing them here I would request you to read it carefully and we will also try to solve those that is the solution of them	test
audio_0_152608.wav	Masked expressions are also micro expressions that are intended to be hidden either subconsciously or consciously	test
audio_0_122252.wav	And attitude is what I want you to pay attention to because this attitude, the same attitude, has connections with probably Muthasi's behavior to Nani Amma when she frequently comes by the house asking for work	test
audio_0_42083.wav	So, supposing even if suppose, we solve this equation how will this help us	test

audio_0_147993.wav	Now all of this information is somehow embedded in this long random looking string	test
audio_0_195881.wav	So let's say these are the input and output terminals of this block, whatever that is, then the output versus input, that is the voltage at the output versus voltage at the input, should have a characteristic like this, which means if this V In increases V Out, what is driven to the source should actually decrease	test
audio_0_21097.wav	89	test
audio_0_176100.wav	Terminology will mean again I am giving a bit more of electrical engineering example	test

audio_0_174932.wav	Contrast, match and map	test
audio_0_377.wav	So, at the time of start what you do that this resistance should be at maximum and then you start there what you call that you are then you give the supply	test
audio_0_20539.wav	Do you remember that cost classification	test
audio_0_176472.wav	Many people want to deal with this critical thinking independently	test
audio_0_194267.wav	So, the reason is if n bar is 0 bar in Z x mod x squared; that means, n is in the ideal generate by x squared, but the only integer that is an ideal generate by x squared is 0	test
audio_0_36286.wav	And finally, this is probably why you are in the class, why is computational electromagnetics useful	test
audio_0_111763.wav	Now, the last problem that determines the S matrix of a lossless transmission line, this is a distributed line	test
audio_0_113732.wav	So, the source side you see there was source, there was the Z S part and then when you are giving these to Z l	test
audio_0_146449.wav	But then when the task is started to execute at the next frame boundary, the deadline is very near	test
audio_0_102951.wav	In some compiler, it is called a in debug; in some other compiler, it will be called something else	test
audio_0_180441.wav	this is usually obtained through channel sounding, but again assume that R h of tau as a function of tau, just says where are the multi path components, where are the strong ones and then, eventually the multipath components died on below certain threshold and we now are able to characterize this as the multipath behavior of the channel	test
audio_0_184956.wav	So, this latter case which is in green is like an AWGN channel which has got average SNR equal to gamma	test
audio_0_175319.wav	Now how do we compute the PO/PSO attainment	test
audio_0_78017.wav	, also a Science paper in 2007 this discusses about this relative sliding of different focal adhesion proteins	test

audio_0_154306.wav	Second, confusion	test
audio_0_236262.wav	You are doing, such good work	test
audio_0_167770.wav	First we have to transform the circuit from time domain into s domain, so the source which is unit step function when you will convert into s domain it will become 1 by S, inductor will become the inductor is sL and value of L is 1so it will become S	test
audio_0_165528.wav	So, this system to be completely state controllable that is necessary and sufficient condition is that the following the matrix that is S which is having n cross nr dimension, the controllability matrix which we have augmented matrix containing B and A matrix as component	test
audio_0_201618.wav	It can be 6 units, it can be 10 units whatever the units we go ahead	test
audio_0_70715.wav	So, this will be 42 into 0	test
audio_0_134960.wav	So, you think of a bicycle, a mode of transport and something comes to your mind	test
audio_0_75300.wav	While laser ablation gives us information about contribution of single stress fiber to contractility, this is cell contractility, trypsin de adhesion gives us a whole cell contractility measure, and traction force gives us forces it main measures forces exerted by cells	test
audio_0_76203.wav	So, this is when you add a nucleus	test
audio_0_159874.wav	The next one is a more interesting is the order, does the order matter for this operations	test
audio_0_27768.wav	For 4 nodes we have to do one level of shifting perhaps to repair the heap property then we go up now 1 and 2 are the original values, they may be wrong	test
audio_0_219898.wav	So, we know that b lies between 0 and 200, so the range for b is anything in this region	test
audio_0_64505.wav	let say, if we look at this gate, we can say that one of the line of this gate is permanently stuck at zero	test
audio_0_10506.wav	Now if you come to this if you come to this figure so, first suppose if this voltage is v	test
audio_0_147289.wav	Here we are just showing you the Facebook which is likes and followers	test
audio_0_141018.wav	You can see certain stimulus on the screen and see this full chain	test
audio_0_110472.wav	47 and that will be the length of the stub	test
audio_0_182933.wav	In the case of the, you have changed the channel statistic, it is no longer Rayleigh	test
audio_0_29644.wav	So, when he will employ 10 people he will employ this person also	test
audio_0_20670.wav	If you want to calculate BEP as a sales value, we had assumed fixed cost of 1,000	test
audio_0_72781.wav	This is given by Alistair Cockburn from experiments he could determine that paper is a cold form of communication not very effective	test
audio_0_38022.wav	So, now, you want to put a perpendicular bisector from	test
audio_0_231239.wav	So, now look at it students I have given you all challenging problems statements	test
audio_0_70094.wav	So, you have to have a hanger and everything for the lab coat or the lab gowns then you have to have the place for the mask	test
audio_0_239818.wav	Or, will it only start a process, that will have to be pushed and motivated, by something else	test
audio_0_108570.wav	This site that we see could be the same for all authors regardless of who it is	test
audio_0_4686.wav	So, if you make it like this take your what you call in the downwards, it will be 6 into that i 1 minus i 2 minus V Thevenin is equal to 0	test
audio_0_176102.wav	, these words mean only something specific to people who are working in the area of Electrical Engineering or Electronics Communication Engineering	test
audio_0_78674.wav	So, consistent with this particular study, so hMSCs then would think that they are in a more stiff environment and they will differentiate into osteoblasts	test
audio_0_202403.wav	So, we will quickly go to this cam mate, we will select this cam path and cam follower for this cam follower we need to select the vertex of this	test
audio_0_33434.wav	So, look at the term I have taken outside the bracket multiplied that by the term inside, I get i plus 1 times delta x, second term is 2 alpha n	test
audio_0_208609.wav	Let us use CC prime for this a horizontal CC prime we are going to use, a horizontal line name it as C somewhere it goes C prime axis	test
audio_0_201139.wav	There will be a voltage k times v i which is the output voltage	test
audio_0_28679.wav	Once you have the recursive program then the memo table and the dynamic programming almost comes out automatically from that	test
audio_0_44002.wav	Numerically	test
audio_0_55389.wav	these are all channel channel, this is channel, this is a channel, and so on	test
audio_0_150374.wav	So, the search results can be; search results can be used, these kinds of techniques	test
audio_0_61884.wav	so here victim is driven by a gate that is driving noise	test
audio_0_110700.wav	In electrical control, this is used in many type of block diagram, when we try to find the transfer function from that, generally, this formula is used	test
audio_0_180802.wav	So, given that you have designed it using this underlying principle the probability of outage will be the probability that the actual path loss that you have encountered at a distance d is greater than the average path loss plus the margin basically you have exceeded the allowable margin and this is how we would visualize a noise limited system that is there is no other impairment other than the noise	test
audio_0_109226.wav	In fact, all the books that are there in our library, it just the copyright notices sufficient there is no need to separately register that	test
audio_0_43581.wav	So, again here is the situation where the answer is a very beautiful geometric answer	test
audio_0_207907.wav	And it is hollow inside that for that we have this dashed lines; this is a tapered one that is the reason we have that tapered one	test
audio_0_109882.wav	You can find out what is the maximum reflection coefficient you can tolerate, and then you can find what the value of your theta m is	test
audio_0_83182.wav	It is present in all active and passive components	test
audio_0_99156.wav	So, just see the difference, here it is written like this, here it is or if I write it like this	test
audio_0_189240.wav	So, the inputs for the function read dot csv it is similar to what we saw in the previous lecture for read dot delim	test
audio_0_79363.wav	So, to study the effects of these proteins what people have done is they have created mouse models, where they have deleted the expression of either dystrophin which is called an MDX mouse where the dystrophin protein is missing	test
audio_0_5313.wav	And similarly your 1 upon X P is equal to X S upon R S square plus X S square	test
audio_0_203177.wav	First, we have to construct a triangle of required base and height	test
audio_0_228766.wav	So, it can never be eliminated, that is why we use the word confidence intervals, because 100 percent confidence would never come in random kind of errors	test
audio_0_121905.wav	And I would suggest that this jailhouse is a foreshadowing of the jailing of the Kabaliwala for a crime, a grievous crime that he commits at the high point of the story	test
audio_0_52633.wav	if i can show that an accelerating charge, give me a propagating disturbance which goes as for which the e field is, one over r is perpendicular direction of propagation i have shown in the radiation	test
audio_0_194696.wav	The point is that the parameters of a transistor or in general any active device, semiconductor device, vary quite a lot	test
audio_0_92632.wav	If these a’s and b's are Fourier coefficients, then this error is going to be less than or equal to any other real number if we choose for these coefficients	test
audio_0_176293.wav	That means in any situation you have some known variables and some unknown variables	test
audio_0_122709.wav	It's not the ideal, cliched, homely home with lots of comforts around	test
audio_0_93116.wav	but remember, when you go for the interview, all these you know new fashions and all they are not important	test
audio_0_99092.wav	Again, another point is constructed to the same constructor and you get the output for that; then there is a print which shows that the rectangle, I am sorry	test
audio_0_176614.wav	So one is reasonably ready, it does not mean that as soon as he completes his undergraduate program he is from the next day he starts performing as required by the industry but he is ready with the knowledge and skill set and he may take a short time for him to start practicing as per the requirement of the organization	test
audio_0_205318.wav	So, that is a reason it is on XY axis	test
audio_0_115029.wav	so if i am issuing the thing, ah, issuing the draft, then the verification	test
audio_0_86042.wav	So, let us see how the canaries actually work internally with a small example	test
audio_0_229798.wav	2 millimeter, it lies on positive side as well as it lies on negative side millimeter, this is a shaft this is shaft, ok	test
audio_0_204273.wav	So, now, this is good and fine moves within the slot	test
audio_0_50728.wav	a equals b, so i can write that a should be in the z direction, so the function of z on the axis, and it should be there, is mu zero i	test
audio_0_206220.wav	Bottom one coincides and we see this entire line as this one	test
audio_0_168829.wav	Now, if you want to represent through the switch this would be the circuit	test
audio_0_146418.wav	It will have problems as you will see	test
audio_0_176537.wav	Understand what an outcome is and its most important features	test
audio_0_130430.wav	so exploiting this fact, one can write: p three by p four is equal to p two by p one	test
audio_0_43958.wav	Right and dl let us call dl prime because I am going over this is my contour right	test
audio_0_26243.wav	The sum is not the part of this function	test
audio_0_202639.wav	75 and so on so things	test
audio_0_194223.wav	So, they will be lots of terms, but there will be exactly one term with degree n plus m	test
audio_0_184695.wav	So, I am going to write expectation subscript gamma naught to tell you that only over	test
audio_0_104678.wav	So, that is basic typeid operator	test
audio_0_52193.wav	this is pity, much like if i have a metallic sphere we consider earlier	test
audio_0_65843.wav	So, what do you want when they dissect, why do not you record it	test
audio_0_76225.wav	So, there has been another finding that if you compare the mutation rate of different cancers, what has been found that cancers which originate in stiffer tissues like bone have higher rates of mutation	test
audio_0_196339.wav	Similarly, while calculating the output resistance, the source resistance here must be in place	test
audio_0_32050.wav	Node based elements typically have limited accuracy compared to edge based elements, edge based elements required to be very careful about vectors and directions ok	test
audio_0_183577.wav	So, this is nothing but fv the cdf using V threshold as the as the parameter this would be given by 1 minus e power minus V threshold by V rms whole square	test
audio_0_215554.wav	it is in all directions, nothing but omni directional	test
audio_0_145830.wav	But after it has started using the resource, a very high priority task started executing and it needed the resource	test
audio_0_204673.wav	So, axis dash dot line	test
audio_0_23054.wav	so that is where he says that i do not want to miss the collective intelligence available in my team, irrespective of their differences	test
audio_0_57964.wav	suppose i have floor plan like this, and these are the different blocks: a, b, c, d and e	test
audio_0_5334.wav	So, you find out thatthis 2 are in parallel this 4 plus j 3 and are in parallel you find out say equivalent	test
audio_0_193795.wav	So, we have seen in an earlier video that image of an ideal under a ring homomorphism is an ideal	test
audio_0_63575.wav	lets look at these different design styles separately so that you can have an idea regarding the merits and demerits of this approaches, and why and when should one use one approach i means over the other	test
audio_0_143088.wav	This is once again summarizing the items in the balance sheet for you	test
audio_0_225947.wav	So, M 3, M 4, M 5, M 6 and M 8, these are various types of taps which are available in the market today, by using these steps you create a thread	test
audio_0_187676.wav	And the transition of the probability at 0	test
audio_0_220734.wav	And now because of this, when we go from 7 to 8, the longest path for 8 must be updated from 2 to 4	test
audio_0_183932.wav	You are trying to estimate the multi path, you have to estimates with delays	test
audio_0_207431.wav	So, first of all I have to pick center point, go to some location, click arc I want	test
audio_0_186414.wav	So, this is an example, where I have executed the R file, using the source with echo, you can see, in the console, that it printed a the command a equal to 11 and the command b is equal to a time 10 and also the output print c of a, b with the values	test
audio_0_152275.wav	The authors identified over 6,000 such user profiles we observed that the creation of such profiles surged considerably right after the blast occurred	test
audio_0_200016.wav	To turn on the MOS transistor you need a threshold voltage and beyond that you have this amount and that is called the over drive	test
audio_0_100300.wav	We will continue discussions on the dynamic binding in the next module	test
audio_0_198099.wav	Let me show both and later depending on convenience I will show only one or the other	test
audio_0_96883.wav	C++ introduces a new operator; the name of that operator is operator new or new simply	test
audio_0_23284.wav	So what could be the better way of do doing it or dealing with the situations let us see what will it happen if it continues deficient emotional skills may be the reason that more than half of the marriages end in divorce	test
audio_0_234866.wav	How do we, as human resources managers, manage sick leave	test
audio_0_218082.wav	ah, ok, this is an oscillator	test
audio_0_94830.wav	while we discussed in the previous class that there are certain stages in a preparation and those stages can be taken care of, even when you are writing the presentation	test
audio_0_210650.wav	Pick this one the lines by holding control button	test
audio_0_229770.wav	What are limit gauges we will cover little later, but since the word has come I would like to say see it is the in a mass production what happens mass production every component would be like to be validated or checked before it gets into assembly	test
audio_0_173830.wav	While we state here that means you can design a good test item bank and also ensure validity and reliability, this we will be elaborating only in the next module on Course Design	test
audio_0_40244.wav	N discrete points, by doing this are we doing anything to ensure that the voltage between r m and r m plus 1 is still 1 volt, we are enforcing the left hand side at r m then the next; so we have one segment over here we have one more segment over here	test
audio_0_137569.wav	So now remember that there is no averaging strictly speaking, because of the fact that there is no tank you are actually directly releasing the effluent into the river	test
audio_0_8884.wav	So, here you put i 1, then that; that means, your 50 minus v 1 by 5 plus 3 is equal to i 2	test
audio_0_239921.wav	So, that is very essential	test
audio_0_137941.wav	So, this is a simple pressure release valve, so you see that this is the inlet, this is the inlet, so very simple, this is the drain, right	test
audio_0_139863.wav	So, the cylinder H coming down is actually being, here the net force is actually being controlled	test
audio_0_131311.wav	so now you see, if we go back now you see that from point seven there is this: much of heating will be done in the boiler itself	test
audio_0_95095.wav	after some days i see that they start asking me either by letter or by phone: what other vehicles do i have	test

audio_0_97966.wav	One last point to remember here that when you overload delete usually try not to overload it with extra parameters I cannot say that this is wrong according to C++, but there is a certain context in which only you can use a delete operator which is overloaded with more parameters than the void star first parameter that it must have, and till we have come to explain those context you will not be even if you overload a delete with extra parameters you will not be able to use them everything will be shown up as a compilation error	test
audio_0_231001.wav	We are trying to talk about first measure a physical variable	test
audio_0_58381.wav	so because it is algebraic manipulation it is ah little difficult implement	test

audio_0_203118.wav	Here a simple rocket consists of many parts	test
audio_0_181483.wav	Now in India definitely we know that the entire band is not given to one operator they are given to different operators	test
audio_0_58171.wav	so this corresponds to the total timing budget of that node	test
audio_0_14468.wav	So, v 1 v 2 v 3 all you have got in terms of it is i 1 it is i 2 i 3 , now from equation 3; that means, from equation 3 v 3 is equal to v 2 ; that means, v 3 is equal to 12 i 3 and v 2 is equal to 6 i 2 that means, we have got an relation i 2 is equal to 2 i 3	test
audio_0_235528.wav	Which means, that we have to plan judiciously, for handing over our responsibilities, to the other person, who is going to be in our position, when we leave that position, for various reasons	test
audio_0_166246.wav	So, when you simplify you will get the value of Rth 9 ohm	test
audio_0_77952.wav	So, there is given a filament you can have three events, right	test
audio_0_158362.wav	So this is view serializable because this is view equivalent to this transaction T1T2	test
audio_0_94660.wav	moreover, while doing so, as it is seen especially the youngsters one, they mention the course title and not the name	test
audio_0_190611.wav	b d itself is not divisible by 3	test
audio_0_38302.wav	So, now, what happens to the right hand side	test
audio_0_181613.wav	So, that is the counterpart of the logical channel for the control common control on the downlink it is random access on the uplink again this is how the uplink	test
audio_0_164703.wav	Namaskar, so in last class we were discussing about the state variable and we also saw that if you n order differential equation	test
audio_0_157593.wav	So essentially the idea is that the conflicting operations are executed in the correct timestamp order	test
audio_0_199466.wav	Because the drain is not in this picture we are sensing at the source and feeding back to the gate, I will connect the drain to the supply voltage	test
audio_0_202972.wav	Based on that we are going to show this picture	test
audio_0_8984.wav	So, all this things, if you make it and this this directly, you can write I told you i 1 plus i 2 plus i 4 is equal to 0, you now know i 1, i 2 and i 3 in terms of all this	test
audio_0_31851.wav	So, just to tell you that these are real quantities and so as you saw from the previous lecture, Maxwell’s equations were these four without the terms in the blue font ok, we all know everything in the black font already	test
audio_0_8689.wav	So, same as before this current is I 1 the upward direction is I 2 minus I 1 and this is the current going to the lord say I 2	test
audio_0_94806.wav	of course others may also have, but then you are going to attract or to create an opportunity for yourself in the mind of the recruiters	test
audio_0_31631.wav	So, this kind of basic check you should do you write down this expression ok	test
audio_0_149034.wav	So, you should look at the first column which is the id, which is the unique id that the users have on Twitter, we have put x so that you can also not identify the users for now	test
audio_0_104817.wav	Again, this is a typical way to write in C	test
audio_0_102757.wav	So, this does not take a symbol, it takes a type as the name of the operator, it changes to A	test
audio_0_178547.wav	And of course, methods like Altamouti code needs to need to know what the channel is	test
audio_0_145415.wav	It prevents the page from being swapped from the memory to the hard disk and therefore the jitter in memory access reduces	test
audio_0_72919.wav	So next, in 5th year he is getting 1,000	test
audio_0_205006.wav	Similarly, one has to be careful here because we have this exterior object	test
audio_0_9322.wav	And these two this one and this one these two are conducting plates	test
audio_0_208243.wav	So, any inclination angle with hp we will be seeing that by projecting onto that vertical plane	test
audio_0_239283.wav	And, we will take it from here, in the next class	test
audio_0_152282.wav	So, in the introduction, the authors actually mentioned generally about the Boston Marathon blast, what happened and how the incidence is planned out of the Boston marathon	test
audio_0_179562.wav	And many times this is the graph that a sort of enables us to sort of say oh now the whole things sort of makes sense, makes sense	test
audio_0_183044.wav	Now, you are transmitting 8 bits per symbol again very significant difference and a significant change	test
audio_0_95287.wav	say, for example: sometimes it so happens that you are not in a position to entertain all the requests which have been made by the writer of the letter, but at the same time you do not want to lose that	test
audio_0_26335.wav	Suppose, instead, we split this initialization into 2 steps; we first create a list of 3 zeroes called zerolist, which says zero for i in range 3	test
audio_0_84894.wav	5 volts, now for 1	test
audio_0_6376.wav	So, it will be 40 divided by 10 plus 40 into this 4 ampere; this 4 ampere current right	test
audio_0_151764.wav	In fact, if I wanted to say something on social networks, but I do not want to be attributed to the post then I would actually use these anonymous social network	test
audio_0_48309.wav	to understand how dielectrics behave, we'll first talk about a polarization	test
audio_0_154028.wav	It is said that in the learning curve 83% is dependent on our side, 11% on hearing and 6% on other senses	test
audio_0_236106.wav	So, they were accused of encouraging child labor, by buying carpets, from these people	test
audio_0_160093.wav	So this itself becomes a key because that is this is all inside one big XML document	test
audio_0_99669.wav	This is just to show that it is like in terms of function template we saw that if the max function had one type parameter T and for char star we wanted a different behaviour so he specialized that and replace T and just put char star and put a different one; function definition for that	test
audio_0_130399.wav	in pv plane, from one to two there is rise in pressure	test
audio_0_98891.wav	So, what it does is something interesting, once I it have written that then I can use the max function like this I can, I will write max within corner bracket I will put a type and then I will show the original name of the function is max that is templatized name and this is the instantiated name, which means that if I when I put this int it means that used the code of max, but take t to be int	test
audio_0_224813.wav	Now, we know that in a min heap insert is logarithmic, delete is also logarithmic even though this is not delete min	test
audio_0_13242.wav	The unit area is known as the strength of the impulse function and when an impulse function has a strength other then unity, the area of the impulse is equals to it is strength right	test
audio_0_197887.wav	It's only in that case that this will be dissipating power and you can replace it with a resistor	test
audio_0_91314.wav	We can write that is as we are writing it, that t is equal 2 pi L by g	test
audio_0_5401.wav	8 degree that is why this voltage is 42	test
audio_0_111382.wav	That means, I will have to connect come from this independent variable to this dependent variable	test
audio_0_187943.wav	This basically says if this is high then there is broad agreement between the two experts right	test
audio_0_215739.wav	so, ah, so that is what we wanted to say about the sessions	test
audio_0_27636.wav	Similarly, here the node 8 could not have been added here before we filled in the right child of 7	test
audio_0_93892.wav	you will find there is a variance in space zones	test
audio_0_235054.wav	And then, you know, of course, there were very variations of this	test
audio_0_117861.wav	so if you look at the instance type, as we have discussed in the ah last slide, so azure provides two types of computational role	test
audio_0_199794.wav	They are replaced by short circuits	test
audio_0_24830.wav	The sunlight tans her skin in this particular geography in India	test
audio_0_60655.wav	address zero will be here, address one will be here, two will be here, three will be here, four will be here and five will be here, and so on	test
audio_0_93958.wav	you will often find that asians, particularly indians, they often stand very close and that may be embarrassing for people of other cultures	test
audio_0_58517.wav	so if you can design the circuits that get embedded into these devices in a way that they consume less power or energy, whatever you call	test
audio_0_100098.wav	Now, I have two classes A and B and I have two objects, I have two pointers one of A type another is of B type which will holds the address of A, and the address of B	test
audio_0_40686.wav	Product right; so this becomes Y of omega is equal to H of omega X of omega	test
audio_0_3884.wav	So that means, you assume that if the switch is closed for a long time at that time inductor also will act as a short circuit then ah then what will be the your current initial initial current	test
audio_0_221466.wav	Likewise, we can do the next hole	test
audio_0_98892.wav	And generate this whole code of the function taking t to be int and then you call on to that function	test
audio_0_4749.wav	This is the current i that moving going to this terminal this this node right	test
audio_0_80374.wav	5 and 20 micro, 20 volts per microsecond	test

audio_0_187026.wav	Beta 1 hat can be estimated from data s beta 1 hat can be estimated from data	test
audio_0_155890.wav	So what does this algorithm do is that this is applicable, first of all, only when the joint condition is equality	test
audio_0_135462.wav	Now look at the map on the right and the date	test
audio_0_132191.wav	so if we have this kind of a heat exchanger which is having two pass for the cold fluid, then this heat exchanger we can neither call it a parallel flow heat exchanger, nor we call it, nor we can call it as a ah, counter flow heat exchanger	test
audio_0_231943.wav	Correct answers: His childish behavior is very irritating	test
audio_0_48816.wav	this also, if i combine these two together, this means curl of a gradient of any quantity will be zero	test
audio_0_51251.wav	the answer is no, because if you recall how electromagnetic waves arise is, we combine the faradays law, curl of e, which is minus partial of b with respect to t, and in free space we say curl of b is equal to mu zero, epsilon, zero, partial of e with respect to t	test
audio_0_50749.wav	so let me make a picture now, concentrating only on one line of force	test
audio_0_224128.wav	So, the indegree is the number of edges pointing into v directed into v, the outdegree of v is a number of edges pointing out of v	test
audio_0_99877.wav	There are several others, like replacing elements in an array, rotating the order of elements	test
audio_0_48254.wav	vector is in the positive z direction because i am going counter clockwise: d x, d, y and this gives me the area of the unit circle and therefore this is minus pi, r square minus two pi	test
audio_0_119122.wav	those who are costumed with client server type of protocol, which are more tightly bound	test
audio_0_186906.wav	So, they can take any value that that we want and also the fact that the way the probability is defined, this would also become a non linear function	test
audio_0_235034.wav	Anyway, so, how do you decide	test
audio_0_204090.wav	Let us just select two this face and this face	test
audio_0_25792.wav	On the other hand if you do a that, so if you see if you do a forcing condition, if you heat it, so this will now be converted to the axial conformer	test
audio_0_105349.wav	If we do that then in terms of the type I still need to add the director type and in terms of here I need to have a director class which is a specialization of the manager, it may have another field which gives the reporting managers and so on	test
audio_0_201949.wav	To fix this, we will select the two edges, this edge and this particular edge to make it coincide with each other	test

audio_0_25852.wav	So, it is not enough to just tell us oh some value was not defined it tells us specifically the name x is not defined	test
audio_0_98212.wav	So, that is the promotion strategy which will tell you that the bindings will happen as this will bind here and this will bind here	test
audio_0_209881.wav	Now, the locus for d is this d' the projector lines, and from c join this line to locate our front view	test
audio_0_64856.wav	lets say, if we just replace this by three and this by two, then this will be connected to this	test
audio_0_8361.wav	I am correcting it so and third case half C v square it will become 4 into e to the power minus 2 sorry minus 2 into t minus 1 micro joule these are all micro just you do it please do it I have done it for a simple thing right	test
audio_0_95956.wav	i mean here you could have, i mean some	test
audio_0_171626.wav	Power is nothing but time rate of expanding or absorbing the energy	test

audio_0_176643.wav	It only says what should be the outcome	test
audio_0_167723.wav	Now, you know that if the voltage across inductor is v at ant time t it will be represented as v in s domain and similarly, current It will be represented as i s	test
audio_0_115319.wav	there should not be ah delay or much delay, or the delays should be within the limit and control over it	test
audio_0_79302.wav	So, you have a 2D plane and these focal adhesions would look like this	test
audio_0_221475.wav	Now, when we go to the next row, likewise this 0 contributes only 0	test
audio_0_176319.wav	Let us go back a little bit and look at these two activities, execute and implement	test
audio_0_108632.wav	There are others which require registration like trademarks and designs	test
audio_0_189701.wav	Similarly you can also access the rows by using the names of the rows	test
audio_0_15437.wav	So, it is giga it is G, then when come 10 to the power 6 it is mega right it is M and so on, 10 to the power 3 is actually it is a not coming to alien to this, but 10 to the power 3 means kilo	test
audio_0_73469.wav	So now this is one about replacing but let's see about the extending case	test
audio_0_229323.wav	If, I am having such kind of plot, this is known as histogram, 70 80, let me say the value is 0 maximum value is 80 here, ok	test

audio_0_67271.wav	So, this is one channel which I call this as a yellow channel and there is another channel, which we call this as a green channel	test
audio_0_6236.wav	But verities of problem will try to solve I have collected problem from several places and try to put it here	test
audio_0_142316.wav	So, you should show the total cash cash equivalent in the beginning and in the end and a reconciliation because in the cash flow statement you have listed all inflows and outflows	test
audio_0_44202.wav	So now, you can think how can we make this more accurate ok	test
audio_0_114301.wav	Transmission lines are less lossy at higher frequency	test
audio_0_7560.wav	So, that is why here also it is written, that your v 1 plus that is v is equal to v 1 plus v 2 that is total voltage	test
audio_0_62331.wav	so we start from the input side	test
audio_0_26821.wav	We can generalize this concept by allowing keys from a different set of things other than just a range of values from 0 to n minus 1	test
audio_0_212021.wav	go back to the original concept of collective intelligence we mentioned	test
audio_0_38031.wav	So, that is not enough and anyway that sounds like a brute force approach is there something cleverer	test
audio_0_163554.wav	So, to suppress backward radiation, i	test
audio_0_37403.wav	Yeah I am taking the difference between i and i minus 1	test

audio_0_60536.wav	i am assuming that when i have designed my f s m, i have already done some simulation analysis based on some real life kind of data and found out how many or what is the chance of each of the transitions means it turns are occurring	test
audio_0_75709.wav	As a first step what you have is actin protrusion	test
audio_0_131491.wav	remember these are absolute temperatures times hundred over one, and for air	test
audio_0_186685.wav	So, on my right I have the plot we are now able to see how the regression line fits	test
audio_0_149908.wav	Also the quality of geographic information is continent, countries, state and this information that is available in this dataset is number of users, number of venues	test
audio_0_157321.wav	There is an index file which contains multiple index entries	test
audio_0_223138.wav	So, therefore I am going from T prime to T, the crucial thing is only depend for which letters I have contract, that fixes the difference uniquely	test
audio_0_147367.wav	This week even the course questions that we are going to be looking at for the course is going to be based on something, some data that you can collect and some analysis that you can do	test
audio_0_9713.wav	And C is given 50 micro farad, so 50 into 10 to the power minus 6 farad and it is L	test
audio_0_176455.wav	And then you have to sit in the workshop and you have to produce your own	test
audio_0_213381.wav	you know, as the chip was not very stable, we had to apply a number of patches in order to ensure that um ah it would work satisfactorily very soon	test
audio_0_116786.wav	we are, ah, we are having x ps installed as that desktop, so i am selecting it	test
audio_0_183919.wav	So, all base stations in CDMA 2000 are going to be using the m sequences to scramble	test
audio_0_9515.wav	So, i will slope is 10 by 2 into 10 to the power minus 6, so v t will be is equal to your 2 into your 10 by 2 into 10 to the power minus 6 into t	test
audio_0_166683.wav	So since we have four terminals we cannot use the passive sign convention directly to find out the polarity of mutual voltage	test
audio_0_159665.wav	Now the granularity of this named item may be a block, maybe a page, maybe the entire database,, maybe a table, etc	test
audio_0_74848.wav	It is an accumulation of ECM proteins including collagen 1	test
audio_0_217913.wav	so all these actions it has to do, it has to be obviously depend because it supports the whole system, supports this quality of service levels	test
audio_0_134515.wav	Just for a purposeful manipulation of one variable to draw inference so that you can draw a larger picture	test
audio_0_119244.wav	basically the function is for summation of this count for every one w one	test
audio_0_220174.wav	So, this is the term which actually comes from accounting from financial things, where you have certain cost which for example you might have in order to run a business	test
audio_0_190518.wav	So, and this particular point I leave for you as an exercise	test
audio_0_61399.wav	if you just just uses that formula you just now shown, and if you do a simplification, you can find del f, i, del u comes to be only s	test
audio_0_105174.wav	2 plus d 2 then the member function has to belong to the class of 4	test
audio_0_21391.wav	That means same 1,000 was generating a contribution of 75 in Z will be now 1	test
audio_0_109294.wav	Then the next generation takes the business and they are able to broaden it and take it to all places	test
audio_0_12958.wav	So, that means v c t is equal to 5 plus 5 e to the power minus 2 into 10 to the power 4 t ah your, that means that is for t greater than 0	test
audio_0_72326.wav	These are some of the terms that are given as explanation for agile model in dictionary but then agile means very fast so the development in agile model should occur very fast in much less time then it occurs in other development models but then then how is it developed very fast	test
audio_0_196948.wav	We have seen that a common source amplifier using P most transistor has the same small signal picture as that using an N most transistor and its characteristics are also largely the same	test
audio_0_49644.wav	using stokes theorem i can write: two pi a times e at the surface is going to be equal to pi a square	test
audio_0_105182.wav	We know that the front functions can actually look inside the class, so what we do	test
audio_0_210611.wav	14 mm	test
audio_0_20854.wav	It is a series of static budgets	test
audio_0_84331.wav	rRight now we have connected to channel one	test
audio_0_131838.wav	one way of extracting thermal energy is that that we can introduce a coil structure, something like this schematically, which can be shown so here	test
audio_0_149219.wav	You can clearly see here that the left one is talking more about market, online, internet, social, love which probably is in random sample also life, music, live, love, right	test
audio_0_216342.wav	right, it starts from a location a, ah, then goes to location b and then reaches location c	test
audio_0_96914.wav	So, that is a that is a something very very interesting because here the example is showing with new if you now do a new with double it will return you a double star pointer	test
audio_0_100312.wav	So, if I copy this, naturally I will need to; while I do coping I know that this string will have to be copied here and we know there are two options to that	test
audio_0_2669.wav	So this way, this way if you look into this the this one right [ ] so this phi r F2 which is with respect each other creates the torque tending to move the rotor in the direction of Fr the if that induction motor is therefore, a self starting device right	test
audio_0_224298.wav	So, note that 22 will come first then 32 will come here, then 43 will come here, and then 78 will come there	test
audio_0_240128.wav	What kinds of skills, will they need	test
audio_0_57506.wav	for example, in this same example, lets do this, let us try to make this change	test
audio_0_121257.wav	Even the political turmoil is dependent on the wins and the loses that they suffer	test
audio_0_34544.wav	M delta t	test
audio_0_109276.wav	If someone an Indian manufacturer starts using IKEA, IKEA could still come and stop that person, because there a right to the mark is established by use international use	test
audio_0_235952.wav	They may not be unlawful, but they are definitely uncomfortable, for us	test
audio_0_147750.wav	Let us say we want to make a small adjustment and make these nodes a little far away	test
audio_0_146909.wav	You should be able to do it when the system is operational	test
audio_0_184483.wav	So, the wide band signal itself is something like this	test
audio_0_226479.wav	So, point number 3 we need to establish in interval within which the true average value of the population is expected to lie and this interval quantifies the probable range of this random error and this is known as random uncertainty, ok	test
audio_0_238763.wav	Immediately, check their emails first thing, and then move on to more orders of business	test
audio_0_24723.wav	The second story that Ideo shared also on either their blog or their video is a case of again a health care case	test
audio_0_47894.wav	so one can say: suppose i have an area through which b is changing and i put a wire around it, then there is an e m f generated which is equal to d, b, d t times the area of that shaded purple things	test
audio_0_64251.wav	so let us concentrate on the second strategy first	test
audio_0_53155.wav	so this is in the x direction for z greater than zero and minus x direction for z less than zero	test
audio_0_186493.wav	Because we have no information labels for these and this is an unsupervised algorithm what we do is we know ultimately there are going to be two clusters	test
audio_0_175011.wav	That is if you are a positive affective behavior first gets reflected as awareness of that	test
audio_0_215393.wav	what is its radiation pattern	test
audio_0_46195.wav	GnU plot is very powerful and you can have different types of outputs, PDF output or SPG output from that one	test
audio_0_61579.wav	so here we shall see that with respective placement, how the choice of the design style can impact or can can effect exactly what we want to do, or you you what we intend to do during the placement phase	test
audio_0_187225.wav	One way to do that would be to represent this picture as a matrix of numbers	test
audio_0_121868.wav	Now, there is some kind of noise outside of the room, outside the house, and Minnie stops her game abruptly	test
audio_0_185145.wav	What will you do data is lost	test
audio_0_162627.wav	So, I can say K T s delta f	test
audio_0_21106.wav	We could do it in two ways	test
audio_0_23166.wav	so when you are giving less freedom to a person to express his thoughts and feelings, you cannot develop individuality	test
audio_0_153764.wav	The Germans find such behaviors alarming	test
audio_0_35411.wav	So, that seems like a bit of a disadvantage	test
audio_0_150891.wav	So, here is a paper that I'm going to be talking in detail today, which is other times, other values, leveraging attitude history to link user profiles across online social networks	test
audio_0_185117.wav	That is our basic equation	test
audio_0_123385.wav	that is what you useful vs	test
audio_0_101767.wav	Now, I would like to highlight something, which is very specific about headers in of standard library	test
audio_0_201574.wav	So, this is the minimalistic way of representing this dimension	test
audio_0_74812.wav	So, based on this they concluded that perturbations of the physical links partially affect the amplitude of fluctuations, because even when the perturbed with actin it dropped, but it did not go or it increase, but didn’t go	test
audio_0_157377.wav	So the intervals of this probe sequence remain fixed	test
audio_0_145676.wav	It could have been entered the previous day, previous hour or may be several years back	test
audio_0_155172.wav	Latest scientific researchers have pointed out a close connection between the body language and our self image, suggesting that by changing our body language we can also change our thinking	test
audio_0_74645.wav	So, this might be your actin stress fiber, similarly this one this will be microtubule	test
audio_0_97469.wav	In the next slide, I have actually since I wanted to work out	test
audio_0_237900.wav	So, i will not make the ground floor, wheelchair accessible	test
audio_0_61645.wav	also, lets spend a little time to recall what you had said about simulated annealing and lets say how we apply this tool you can say tool or algorithm, whatever you say to this particular problem of module placement	test
audio_0_235470.wav	But, individuals could also be focusing on their own selves	test
audio_0_210011.wav	Now, rotate this entire plane by 90 degrees	test
audio_0_98956.wav	So, for that, I had to provide a overloading opera of operator greater than in the complex class, if you remove this you will find that this code will not compiled because the it will deduce T to be complex and then it will say that it requires a greater than operator which does not exist in the complex class	test
audio_0_214137.wav	in order to keep the output stable, the v out has to be stable	test
audio_0_136126.wav	Welcome back to this course on postcolonial literature Today we will continue with our discussion of Raja Rao’s novel Kanthapura	test
audio_0_53425.wav	this should be equal to e transmitted over v two in that medium	test
audio_0_79730.wav	So, peak of E versus T is slightly to the left of F versus T suggesting that if I want to imagine the sequence of events that are happening temporally there is a polymerization event, which would mean as turn over that polymerization event is first pushing the membrane or in other words edge displacement is positive, you have this positive correlation in the red curve	test
audio_0_159180.wav	So let us consider this example and so project name is determined on project ID which in turn is determined by ID	test
audio_0_225180.wav	So, if you have k levels, then the levels are 0, 1 up to k minus 1 from what we just said that is 2 to the 0 plus 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the k, the k minus 1, sorry	test
audio_0_42403.wav	So, waves are coming at all angles over here and we are finding that with ABC’s they get reflected ok	test
audio_0_64423.wav	so if vdd is disconnected, if you read out the contents of the flip flops, all of the bits will be looking at zero	test
audio_0_60877.wav	so accordingly you split this grid like the zigzag path	test
audio_0_2432.wav	So, because of that your this is V1 = minus E1 is ok, but this I0 actually lagging / an angle ∅0 from V1	test
audio_0_188595.wav	So, now, this new data will contain only 34 data observations, because we have already removed one observation	test
audio_0_64080.wav	each cells must have the same height all this cells	test
audio_0_81766.wav	So, when I connect it, and I switch it on, you will be able to see this LED lighte light here, right this led right	test
audio_0_165255.wav	So, in this particular week we discussed about node voltage, nodal analysis and mesh analysis	test
audio_0_67490.wav	we said: let them grow for some time you know significant period of time	test
audio_0_202134.wav	So, it should be in the reverse direction, reverse direction	test
audio_0_140729.wav	That is the question is that if we want to calculate Gu then and we are saying that we need G, we are assuming that we know G accurately, so if you want to calculate Gu and give feedback and if we have u and, we know G, so then why do we need this feedback at all, why do you need this, why can't we just take u and then multiply it by G and then give a feedback that is most simple but what do we get then, we get what is known as, we get what is known as open loop control, there is no feedback what are the problems of open loop control, that any error in G will directly affect the output y any disturbance here, Will not get corrected, the biggest biggest advantage of feedback control is that it gives you performance irrespective of, generally irrespective of, of course you have to know certain things but small modeling errors do not affect performance, that is the single reason for which feedback control is used and if you take this feedback away	test
audio_0_48481.wav	a over two epsilon zero	test
audio_0_21185.wav	It is also useful for other decisions like profit planning because entity should know how much units it should produce or up to what level it should extend its service	test
audio_0_72578.wav	So during estimation phase, what needs to be estimated, report, cost, resource and project duration	test
audio_0_178926.wav	Again it is very important to tie it to the channel model that we are assuming	test
audio_0_186160.wav	You keep increasing the degree of the polynomial and for each case, build the model using the training set and see how the MSE of that particular model is on the validation set and plot this MSE on the validation set as a function of the degree of the polynomial	test
audio_0_6527.wav	Also, we can write that B is equal to mu into H; instead of mu 0, we can write mu into H in any material right your what you call in any in a any particular you are what you call in material	test
audio_0_112284.wav	So, both the power transfer can be there internally inside the impedance matching network	test
audio_0_40117.wav	So, these constants A and B will be functions of x prime that you can sort of anticipate now itself right and that will come from boundary condition	test
audio_0_204774.wav	Now, let us look at the loss example	test
audio_0_198958.wav	Of course, for any other value of W	test
audio_0_141410.wav	So, numerator also will take at cost of sales	test
audio_0_239064.wav	And again, you know, the employees will not like that	test
audio_0_194196.wav	So, as I told you earlier Z, Z is an integral domain; another example would be Z mod 2Z this is an integral domain this is an integral domain; what about Z mod 4Z, this is not an integral domain, let us see why; not an integral domain, why	test
audio_0_223969.wav	So, let us do the same thing, with DFS and let us compute the pre and post numbers	test
audio_0_144775.wav	So, the day 1 that is on 1st January, the balance sheet shows capital of 2 lakhs	test
audio_0_105031.wav	There is no surprise till this point	test
audio_0_209300.wav	In the next class we will learn more about these 3 dimensional drawings	test
audio_0_64796.wav	so this step is shown here	test
audio_0_212199.wav	load is always varying, right, its a dynamically varying load	test
audio_0_35802.wav	So, can you anticipate what will happen	test
audio_0_171905.wav	And then we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term, which we have found in the first step	test
audio_0_225564.wav	Now, let us look at the other strategy we talked about namely Kruskal's algorithm	test
audio_0_71586.wav	As we are saying that it's a important concept for the errors when the mistakes are made by the developers, they must be fixed in the same phase	test
audio_0_154290.wav	So, people who are experienced and people who have been trained to lower the defenses and other people will be actively taking certain actions to involve the audience and to get their participation before they actually begin either their dialogue or professional talks or presentations	test
audio_0_191844.wav	So, coefficients of c f 0 is c a i	test
audio_0_3247.wav	8 degree minus 240 degree	test
audio_0_114281.wav	For an n port network you need an either an N network analyzer you can 3 4 ports are also there and typically up to any microwave frequency nowadays even 550 mega hertz, 550 Giga hertz up to that you can measure various networks the thing even people are trying to build up 1 tera hertz network analyzer in packet company presently they are called Keysight technologies that company has in Japan	test
audio_0_53823.wav	so unbalance force is going to be this pressure here at the left, delta p out adds to the right and therefore unbalance force is going to be b d y by d x plus d d two y by d x square delta x minus b d y by d x f x	test
audio_0_103560.wav	I would first want you to look at the left part of the code only do not look at this part, do not look at this part, this part as if it is not there	test
audio_0_51989.wav	If they are at opposite signs, then force is going to be attractive	test
audio_0_123921.wav	you have the revalue at the two port parameters	test
audio_0_181663.wav	So, the concept of diversity, the benefits of diversity or the ways in which we will exploit diversity are 2 fold, one is transmit diversity the other one is receive diversity	test
audio_0_99597.wav	In the current module, we will continue on that and our focus would be the other kinds of templates that C++ has, which is known as the Class Template	test
audio_0_178779.wav	So therefore, the signal component I want to compute the SNR, SNR, the signal component	test
audio_0_73596.wav	So the necessary information may not be available	test
audio_0_188059.wav	We also looked at how to answer some of the important question that gets associated while assessing a model	test
audio_0_166271.wav	And, then you have the output say Cs and the transfer functions are like Y1 for this set, then Z2 you have a loop which is say minus Y1 then Y3 you have another loop which is minus of Z2 and then this is minus of Y3, then Z4 and this is a unity gain the transfer function	test
audio_0_197736.wav	So that is the incremental drain voltage phaser or the voltage between drain and source	test

audio_0_173571.wav	This is only to ensure that minimum standards are attained	test
audio_0_111604.wav	So, this c1 c2 is a value finally, we have to find now equivalent voltage and currents are like this now enforce the power equivalence	test
audio_0_153122.wav	But despite it we find that the three different types of space which researchers have pointed out are the fixed feature space, the semi fixed feature space and the non fixed feature space	test
audio_0_198820.wav	So the MOS transistor simply consists of a voltage control current source whose value is given by this okay so the small signal incremental model of the most transistor in saturation region	test
audio_0_71700.wav	So they are coming under these systems software kind of things like operating systems and real time systems embedded systems etc they are coming under the embedded mode now we'll see the semi detached mode semi detached mode semi distance which are coming in between organic mode and embedded mode they normally we call them as semi detached mode so semi det, semi detached mode products, they lie in between what somewhere, this organic and embedded modes	test
audio_0_104694.wav	So, basically now you do not you cannot track that you have actually a different dynamic object residing there because all that you get is static information alone	test
audio_0_37659.wav	So, point piecewise constant approximation I can make for or if k is something more complicated there is no problem what will I do for this term	test
audio_0_71046.wav	Majority of these employees are casual laborers and mining being a risky profession, casualties are very high	test
audio_0_203819.wav	In last few classes, we learned some of the concepts in Solidworks; advanced concepts in solidworks from today onwards, we will learn it	test
audio_0_148931.wav	com or apple	test
audio_0_24440.wav	So even there is a lot of talking that has been done with the market, parents market as in the school students, then the parents, teachers, then the school admin staff in numerous occasions where we have come with different types of insights from different regions students from different regions have different types of insights	test
audio_0_34983.wav	Next thing is we need to terminate a computitional boundary somewhere, how do we terminate it right; so, absorbing boundary conditions	test
audio_0_18254.wav	So, equivalent will be 4 micro farad therefore, what will happen that ah their equivalent is 4 micro farad those; that means, this 4 micro farad then 6 micro farad and 20 micro farad are in parallel are in parallel parallel means just a combination just addition	test
audio_0_119767.wav	these applies to sensors, to actuators, but also applies to type of network involved in the variety of progress, like some may using wifi, some may ZigBee, Bluetooth and type if things and and it a whole lot of ah interoperability issues need to be addressed out ah, out there, right, so so that ah, ah, in order to address this sort of issue, ah, this iot gateways are required so that it is addressed at a more localized fashion	test
audio_0_69960.wav	So, we are not really bothered about it, our goal is very clear we are using this as a tool; simple tool produces some xyz compound of our own commercial, medical, significance full stop	test
audio_0_82844.wav	see so now, we have 5 / √ 2	test
audio_0_27083.wav	As with this LCS problem, we have to fill an order n squared size table, but the main difference between LCS and this is that in order to fill an entry in the LCS thing we have to look at only a constant number of entries	test
audio_0_174801.wav	This I consider a very important book that if you are working within the modified or Anderson Bloom’s taxonomy, this is a very very important book to have or access to this book	test
audio_0_236130.wav	And, that can open, a lot of doors, to unethical practices	test
audio_0_202081.wav	So, a centre line we have constructed, and a rectangular patch	test
audio_0_152744.wav	An attitude which does not want to become very open and at the same time it may also have certain anxiety or it may also indicate certain negativity	test
audio_0_61578.wav	now i means i have repeatedly mentioned earlier also that many of the steps in vlsi physical design depends very much on the exact design style that you are following in creating your final layout	test
audio_0_4798.wav	So, solution is given	test
audio_0_2767.wav	So, therefore, it is it is therefore, seen that that the frequency of rotor current is induced emf and [ ] rea[ctance] and reactance all vary in direct proportion to the slip	test
audio_0_190682.wav	So, you have a by 2 power of n	test
audio_0_156274.wav	Now, one interesting thing or one important thing that you must have noticed is that these serializability notions are just concerned about the right and read, but not the values that is being read or right	test
audio_0_175365.wav	271	test
audio_0_131024.wav	by a good design, by a good estimate we can reduce them	test
audio_0_63274.wav	that means: ah, you have two subtrees, ah, there is a connection between then you are trying to find out the tapping point	test
audio_0_56008.wav	so whenever we are considering the setup, setup time, ok, thats it	test
audio_0_53727.wav	if i have disturbance, and let's call it or denoted by disturbance x at time t equal to zero, it travels un distorted	test
audio_0_135785.wav	However, Antonio Gramsci argues, that there is also another way in which one can exert one's authority over another	test
audio_0_100514.wav	But, you hold a reference to that	test
audio_0_181925.wav	He said I am going to transmit 2 different signals x 1 of t from antenna 1 x 2 of t from antenna 2 and I am going to receive them at the receiver	test
audio_0_174859.wav	Now some sample activities which we will state in the form of let us say a kind of a problem statement what you can ask in assessment	test
audio_0_42528.wav	Right the electric field this is what is unknown	test
audio_0_73534.wav	How do you measure it	test
audio_0_169081.wav	So cause can be an input like if you provide voltage or current input which causes the element to either absorb or dissipate the energy	test
audio_0_52764.wav	this term is zero and therefore this entire term also drops off	test
audio_0_32572.wav	Yeah, but that it does not cancel of the E incident in some sense I mean you cannot forget about the E incident ok	test
audio_0_62800.wav	so later on we shall be looking into this in much more detail and we shall be working out lot of examples of particular important is clocked routing	test
audio_0_158386.wav	So that means that not every view serializable schedule is conflict serializable and we already saw an example	test
audio_0_76161.wav	The second paper is Balaban et al	test
audio_0_200233.wav	That is the negative feedback action that we want	test
audio_0_100014.wav	So, we have different records, this record could mean for an engineer, this record could be for manager, this could be for an engineer, this could be again for an engineer and so on, this could be for manager and so on	test
audio_0_48599.wav	So, let us see if I take a volume small volume here, if whatever that fluid is coming in whatever is leaving is equal	test
audio_0_175292.wav	Now to compute all these we take a sample course, Analog Circuits and Systems, credits are 3 classroom hours and 1 laboratory session per week	test
audio_0_57099.wav	this algorithm can be used to find the minimum radius spanning tree	test
audio_0_214578.wav	if there is a support for thumb two means that you do have hardware divide instruction capability, so you will be able to do both thirty two bit and sixteen bit instruction	test
audio_0_214376.wav	now let us say you want to do a memory to memory copy	test
audio_0_84401.wav	tThere is a reference RF, IEF, yes	test
audio_0_171889.wav	Now, if you are asked to find out the Laplace transform of f t, you will say F s is nothing but F1s upon e to the power minus T s, where F1s is the Laplace transform of first period of the function	test
audio_0_55566.wav	ok, and obviously this can be more effective because you are changing the weights based on the current scenario and the old values can become outdated when you make some modifications	test
audio_0_102966.wav	So, this is how you write it suppose f is a function, and g is another function, and f basically calls g	test
audio_0_34649.wav	Start by Debye model, take Fourier take the inverse Fourier transform, simplify the convolution and now I have got a relation purely in terms of E right	test
audio_0_104648.wav	It should be able to compare the dynamic type of two such objects and say if there are of the same type, there of the different types	test
audio_0_95814.wav	now let us discuss what exactly do we mean by full block format	test
audio_0_229662.wav	The manufacturing of a component under such conditions is called as interchangeability interchangeable manufacturing, ok	test
audio_0_83723.wav	This equation explains that a CMRR is practically very large, though both V c and V d components are present; you can see V d and V c are present, still this CMRR is very large; the output is mostly proportional to the different signal only and common mode component is greatly rejected	test
audio_0_48559.wav	So, starting from a boundary, one can find field everywhere else if differentials of the field are known	test
audio_0_102759.wav	So what it must return it must return an A type object, it cannot return anything else	test
audio_0_194906.wav	So the total quantities will be VGS total is the operating point part plus VI, VDS total is the operating point part, minus 4	test
audio_0_130988.wav	then we have to also keep some finite amount of approach	test
audio_0_165688.wav	What is a State Transition Matrix	test
audio_0_146317.wav	In the major cycle the tasks are assigned to frames let's say this green task to this first frame, a red one to the second, yellow one to the third and so on, and in the next major cycle they are repeated identically	test
audio_0_61347.wav	thats actually what is saw earlier when we discussed the static timing analysis and also the zero skew algorithms	test
audio_0_225497.wav	So, between an unsorted list and in a sorted list, we have a trade off in an unsorted list delete max takes linear time, in a sorted list insert takes linear time	test
audio_0_72522.wav	Of course where there is more risk, there is more benefit more benefit more profit but handling this risks will be much more important so we'll try to reduce the number of risks how the number of risks can be reduced so that ultimately the benefits may improve similarly we should see about the	test
audio_0_147771.wav	Similarly, you can change the other parameters	test
audio_0_41609.wav	So, it is minus j by 4 times the Hankel function right	test
audio_0_144153.wav	Now once you decide to use a particular assumption or use a particular accounting concept that should demand be changed from period to period because accounting statements should be comparable from different period	test
audio_0_224657.wav	But, still this summation 1, 2, 3, 4 up to n is O n square and this is something we will see often	test
audio_0_96779.wav	One is a typical function call kind of syntax, where you put the object name and with in parenthesis you put the parameters of the constructor in the same order in which they are define for the constructor	test
audio_0_182383.wav	So, basically there are 2 ways of looking at the direct sequence spread spectrum system, either at a symbol level it is good as a starting point to do that, but very quickly move into start thinking in terms of chips and how we put how we work with the chips, and that is that is very helpful for us ok	test
audio_0_212224.wav	what you perhaps dont know is ah, which you should actually know at this ends, at this point, is what is the v g s	test
audio_0_160703.wav	So one cannot answer whether what type of relation it is in, whether in which normal form it is, unless the functional determines functional dependencies are given	test
audio_0_57982.wav	if you have a floor plan with a cross junction see, this will not correspond to a planer triangular graph because one and two, an adjacent one and four are adjacent, two, three and three, four	test
audio_0_219955.wav	And again we will find that you get the optimum at some corner and the optimum happens to be in this case that you make zero barfis, you make a full amount 300 halwa and then you make the rest into rasmalai and then you get a profit of 3 lakhs 10,000	test
audio_0_223752.wav	So, remember that d 1 to d 12 was the demand, so this is a fixed quantity, either not variables these are known values	test
audio_0_174513.wav	And creating an atmosphere that promotes confidence in student’s ability to succeed	test
audio_0_63881.wav	so, after the clock edge appears, if there are some changes in the inputs, that will no longer be reflected	test
audio_0_225084.wav	So, therefore now we come back to our claim that there is an optimum schedule with no inversions and no idle time, we know that we have an optimum schedule with no idle time, because that general principle	test
audio_0_14833.wav	So, next is that source free RL circuit, we saw till now we saw source free Rc circuit now will see is a source free RL circuit	test
audio_0_160719.wav	So hours does it depend fully on every candidate key	test
audio_0_233409.wav	The person, who is being bullied, is treated another way	test
audio_0_84050.wav	59 kilo hertz that we have already calculated, right	test
audio_0_166361.wav	Now, let us talk about the output equation	test
audio_0_76506.wav	And I argued that this is an inbuilt property that ensures that these tissues or the networks do not get damaged as a consequence of forces	test
audio_0_181658.wav	Shannon capacity as applied to a wireless channel	test
audio_0_184585.wav	Because what can you do with the single carrier system you either choose 16 QAM for the whole signal or 64 QAM	test
audio_0_233649.wav	Transfer of training is, the extent to which, competencies learnt in training, can be applied on the jobs	test
audio_0_154184.wav	In sittings of work and in those situations, which are considered to be serious for example, when somebody is dealing with illness etcetera or is in hospital the most appropriate response is one that is reserved with no smile	test
audio_0_150050.wav	So, you can clearly see that 46 percent of the distances are 150 kilometers	test
audio_0_81141.wav	So, what is the answer is that we can use a non resistor at the non inverting terminal of the op amp	test
audio_0_95676.wav	moreover, if you are observing a particular incident, you know you are observing it only	test
audio_0_42145.wav	So, now how many variables can I say	test
audio_0_80952.wav	So, there is a current that is drawn when there is no load to the Op amp	test
audio_0_1279.wav	For maximum mechanical power output from figure, the conditional will be we have seen know that your what you call in the maximum power transfer theorem say in the d c circuit we have seen, in a c circuit we have seen; in that case the load resistance; this is load resistance the r 2 dash is equal to 1 upon S minus 1 it has to be equal to your r Thevenin plus r 2 dash square plus x Thevenin plus x 2 dash square	test
audio_0_154015.wav	It may be a micro expression, but definitely this gaze is often there just before one is about to reach a decision	test
audio_0_18346.wav	So, what what we have to do is that, we have to find out all these derive the expression for the capacitor current power and energy, this is now a, sketch b sketch the energy as function of time, c specify the inter interval of time when the energy is being stored in the capacitor right	test
audio_0_226781.wav	In telemetry method, first I have to acquire the data, discretize the data, I have to transmit the data	test
audio_0_26024.wav	So, how do we get rid of this space, the second space, right	test
audio_0_139977.wav	Of the department of electrical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, today we are going to look at the content of lesson 1, so let me start my presentation	test
audio_0_185744.wav	So, you use a tuning parameter, run your algorithm and you get good results, then keep that parameter if not you kind of play around with it and then find the best k for your data	test
audio_0_36442.wav	Once you write your these k vectors in terms of angles you will get your n 1 sin theta equal to n 2 sin theta all of that comes from here, but we are not going that route	test
audio_0_224635.wav	So, the assignment happens, if we find a new value A i which is bigger than maxval	test
audio_0_71581.wav	And that's the reason why the later the phase in which the defect gets detected the more expensive is the removal of the defect	test
audio_0_63637.wav	so there are sixteen cells	test
audio_0_185801.wav	a similar illustration for K equal to 5	test
audio_0_202930.wav	Then you will be in a position to really join that by in that way	test
audio_0_166459.wav	So, now to understand these, the finding out the transfer function let us take a few examples so that you can understand the concept more clearly	test
audio_0_108487.wav	There are also certain disadvantages in protection of expression and not in protection of ideas	test
audio_0_55458.wav	so now detailed router will be having the exact specification for this channel: how many nets are going through it, from where it is coming from, when it is going and so on	test
audio_0_50540.wav	here that will be summation	test
audio_0_155894.wav	If yes, they join it, otherwise they proceed to the next and so on so forth	test
audio_0_56919.wav	so here i touch the target	test
audio_0_83872.wav	We can increase the band width we can increase the bandwidth	test
audio_0_156803.wav	Now the question is the following is that suppose as part of this transaction there are two right entries, right T X to some value say 14 and then there is a right T Y some other value say 12	test
audio_0_19022.wav	I hope you have understood the basic concepts now relating to, first about variable cost, fixed cost, then the contribution margin and then about the calculation of BEP	test
audio_0_226124.wav	So, a thread measurement is always conducted by a wire method, which is very simple and popular	test
audio_0_97263.wav	7 or anything like that	test
audio_0_105151.wav	We already have this we know how to add two complex numbers	test
audio_0_60150.wav	let say, along the grid i have one grid point, let say here and one grid point here	test
audio_0_100245.wav	So, if I do p d pointer f it again invokes the function f of the B class	test
audio_0_28398.wav	Now, if we do provide it a value, then, for instance, we can even make sense of ÒA5Ó	test
audio_0_196105.wav	m2 rl, 1 plus j omega c2 r d plus r d plus rl	test
audio_0_55777.wav	so if this cannot be ensured, then the correctness operations can be compromised	test
audio_0_119986.wav	it may not be feasible to scale up after extent right after a particular ah limit ah	test
audio_0_17990.wav	So, in this case what will happen that 2 ohm resistance is taken off	test
audio_0_35375.wav	In integral equations right, I can say that I will make my unknowns using Huygens principle to be the outermost boundary of this, what is the technical difficulty in this, if I use surface integral formulation	test
audio_0_35637.wav	Alright; so, let us review the, we were discussing the surface integral formulation	test
audio_0_19760.wav	So, it is very important that you read it carefully and underline that point which is important	test
audio_0_162345.wav	As in case of electric current, we introduced A the magnetic vector potential in case of M, will introduce the electric vector potential F; that is why I am saying	test
audio_0_116782.wav	for example, our new v m was ten four, two twenty nine, so this was the top public i p address of the v m	test
audio_0_112342.wav	Now, this I 2 plus and I 2 minus they can related to V 2 plus and V 2 minus with the help of the second port characteristic impedance Z naught 2 again most of the cases Z naught 2 I assume to be Z naught the transmission lines characteristic impedance	test
audio_0_144652.wav	Next was inventory, methods like FIFO or method like weighted average we had discussed	test
audio_0_196222.wav	So, in summary, we first calculate the exact solution, that is solution from the nonlinear equation for the operating point, and that we will do numerically or graph graphically later we will see how to do it by hand	test
audio_0_124179.wav	i will show one particular example and you can do it for the other cases	test
audio_0_143971.wav	So, in the balance sheet while showing the inventory, a particular item of stock or inventory will have a cost if its market value is more than the cost, which is more a likelihood that the cost is 10,000, the market value is 12,000	test
audio_0_81045.wav	It is used to design this circuit diagrams or the internal circuit of the amplifiers and lot more	test
audio_0_189451.wav	The first section tells you the formula that we have used, second section tells you the measure of a t and the 5 point summary for it	test
audio_0_174179.wav	So first thing is, is the CO attainable	test
audio_0_63865.wav	but unfortunately, as you can understand, we cannot have this ideal situation in practice, so we will have to live with clock skew	test
audio_0_157433.wav	It can be the actual wall clock time or any logical counter such that this is ordered	test
audio_0_76382.wav	So, your typical force curve on any substrate or let us say on a stiff substrate	test
audio_0_58454.wav	if, if this line changes from zero to one, this will change from one to zero, but for end it will change in the same direction	test
audio_0_186827.wav	Once we have a value for this, any time I get a new point I simply put it into the p of x equation that we saw in the last slide and then get a probability	test
audio_0_153537.wav	In some cultures we find that lack of punctuality is associated with our social prestige	test
audio_0_35314.wav	So, something called conjugate gradient method if you heard these words there are there is a whole family of iterative methods which will solve which will not give you the answer in one shot	test
audio_0_13293.wav	So, basically this is equation of straight line	test
audio_0_78485.wav	So, what essentially we have done is we have exerted some local forces on these cells	test
audio_0_221463.wav	It was already available, but if we do that we can also do that to the node to it’s right and the node to its right and so on, right	test
audio_0_77236.wav	Measuring properties of collagen networks Hello, and welcome to our fifth lecture on Introduction to Mechanobiology	test
audio_0_224517.wav	We have seen Quicksort which is a divide and conquer algorithm which overcomes the requirement for an extra array as in merge sort	test
audio_0_223428.wav	So, we have return the word by the way, bisect and secret this 2, tell us what the values of a i and b j	test
audio_0_59374.wav	so you can measure the size of your area very easily by looking at the width and height of the total overall floor plan and taking the product	test
audio_0_89937.wav	The second technique is known as the Address Sandboxing where we will be able to reduce the overheads compared to Segment Matching but the compromise is that we will not be able to identify the faulty instruction	test
audio_0_70097.wav	And you should have a trash air because most of the time these will be disposable stuff, your gloves and all these things	test
audio_0_229588.wav	So, these are uncontrollable parameters	test
audio_0_217302.wav	so what did we start with	test
audio_0_120923.wav	Plot is about relationship between the events, between the sequence of events	test
audio_0_222952.wav	So, you will do this all the way along the paths	test
audio_0_47184.wav	This will result in a very huge search current which may blow off the diodes	test
audio_0_173931.wav	That means learning depends on the context in which you are learning	test
audio_0_180721.wav	The real part of 1 by gamma minus s must be greater than 0 which is the same as gamma is already a real quantity	test
audio_0_62312.wav	lets say, lets take another block like a multiplexor	test
audio_0_156174.wav	So that is the first part of it	test
audio_0_180434.wav	So, therefore, this autocorrelation becomes R h of delta t, its function depends only on delta t and it is uncorrelated across the different delays, delta of tau 1 minus tau 2	test
audio_0_218250.wav	ok, so look carefully at everything that we discuss now	test
audio_0_219524.wav	So, in this case remember that the boundary condition is not zero, but it is n minus j plus 1, so as I go up, the number increases	test
audio_0_148341.wav	So, we will actually study how police organizations are using this online social media for increasing their effectiveness of keeping this society safely and we will also look at how citizens have beem using social networks to interact with police organizations	test
audio_0_223136.wav	So, this left hand side term is actually this right hand side component depth of x y, times of x plus y	test
audio_0_56731.wav	ok, so for a, you see, for all the bits it is one zero, one zero, one zero, or one zero, one zero, one zero	test
audio_0_156368.wav	So, that means, topological order may actually produce something like t, t, j, t, k	test
audio_0_176085.wav	That means specific to that subject	test
audio_0_75456.wav	So, you can track the ratio of LN by LC as a function of differentiation ok	test
audio_0_154522.wav	However, if the cross is rigid it communicates the tension and anxiety which a person is facing at that time	test
audio_0_149836.wav	We are going to follow this tutorial to install MongoDB	test
audio_0_1561.wav	So, if it is so let now let us see that conductor is carrying current, this side is plus	test
audio_0_152768.wav	In this photograph of former Argentinean president Christina Kirchner, we find that is similar mid position of clenched hands has been displayed	test
audio_0_138294.wav	So if the object is A, then at this point only that, then at this point only the clamping force will be realized, if it is of the, of the size B, then at this point the clamping force will be realized, if it has C, so how much the cylinder will move and where it will stop has to be determined based on the pressure developed in the chamber, so the pressure will develop, the I mean, the backpressure will be developed in the chamber, when this cannot move again, so you see that that there will be, this will, this will actually, then this will actually resist the movement, so therefore a certain pressure difference will arise, right	test
audio_0_220729.wav	So, in this case this 1 will become 0, this 3 will become 2, but here there is no change and here there is no change	test
audio_0_190347.wav	You have already showed that sigma of integers are those integers itself sigma fixes integers	test
audio_0_233645.wav	So, that is over learning	test
audio_0_176388.wav	Is the data complete	test
audio_0_19977.wav	So, let us start, let us try to solve it along with me	test
audio_0_67728.wav	So, now, say for example, to keep it simple you have three different drug molecules x y and z right	test
audio_0_171421.wav	Then static friction, in that case the friction torque T can be defined as plus minus Fs, that is the value of static friction for theta dot equal to 0 that is the object is just about to move	test
audio_0_30952.wav	The integration is the whole domain	test
audio_0_240055.wav	How do we ready our employees for different situations	test
audio_0_43173.wav	So, we will talk about all four different kinds of methods in this course and after you are familiar with all four, then you can choose for a given problem what is the best candidate	test
audio_0_84848.wav	what is the ideal output	test
audio_0_135592.wav	Now what Achebe alleges in his essay “Image of Africa” is that Conrad too, like most European writers writing about the parts of the world that was colonised by them, thought from within this negative/positive binary	test
audio_0_19295.wav	Here when we say vary, what we are thinking of is variation as per level of output, more the usage or more the production, that cost goes up in a linear proportion	test
audio_0_14685.wav	So, both 100 ohm resistors are short circuited and i s c is equal to i N 1 plus 2 3 ampere right	test
audio_0_234842.wav	Some resources here	test
audio_0_142152.wav	Okay, now this was our last item in balance sheet, liability side	test
audio_0_72855.wav	Develop over increment every few days increments to be given get customer feedback, alter if necessary and then finally once accepted by the customer refactor, make the code better, put some design and then take up the next feature	test
audio_0_1700.wav	So, this is your i 2 and this is your i 3 because you are taking clock wise here also clock wise moving this way	test
audio_0_94345.wav	i mean, this is how you can bring the discussion	test
audio_0_26641.wav	Now we have to compute the right case	test
audio_0_214496.wav	see, when you talk about power, we talk about overall power consumption as static power, which is v into i	test
audio_0_151763.wav	Because for example, If I do a post on facebook, if I do a post on twitter it is actually very clear that it is pk ponnurangam dot kumaraguru dot or ponguru in twitter is actually doing the post	test
audio_0_172684.wav	Whereas in courses belonging to engineering and engineering sciences locate the COs in ABV taxonomy table which has 6 by 8 table	test
audio_0_221431.wav	So, any hole will just have by declaration, paths (i,j) equal to 0 because nothing can go through it and this will automatically propagate to its neighbors correctly	test
audio_0_156635.wav	So we saw one serial schedule and we saw one schedule which is equivalent to it	test
audio_0_133584.wav	You were thirsty, you have a glass of water after sometime once again the thirst will reappear	test
audio_0_189456.wav	Now in logistic regression the coefficients gives you the change in log odds of the output for a unit increase in the predictor value which is the input value	test
audio_0_221585.wav	So, in the middle of all these updates if we identify this particular sub sequence of updates s to v 1 then v 1 to v 2 then v 2 to v 3 then we have got the distance	test
audio_0_64310.wav	so the first alternative that i talked about here	test
audio_0_179656.wav	So, actually water filling can in many condition it can do much better so, but we still agree that water filling has a benefit therefore, I know this is something that we would definitely like to keep and exploit to the maximum	test
audio_0_182581.wav	They are uniformly distributed in angle that is correct, uniformly distributed in angle	test
audio_0_188390.wav	In this case what it means, is if I take the left hand side of the equation Ax equal to b, and then make some linear combinations of some rows of A, at least one of the rows of A is going to be a linear combination of the other rows of A; that is the reason why the rank of the matrix became less than m	test
audio_0_40487.wav	So, you make get faster convergence with Fourier series and so on, and for testing, testing its you could do delta testing or you could do Galerkins method where you use the same basis function right	test
audio_0_197573.wav	So we can complete it through an amplifier or any other device	test
audio_0_181903.wav	Now, we will do this block, we will call it as diversity preprocessing, which means that you have to do something to the diversity signals before transmitting	test
audio_0_80680.wav	So, whenever you see an indicator circuits, most of the cases you will find CMOS	test
audio_0_238751.wav	So, it is always important, because these things help the employee, develop an understanding of the organization	test
audio_0_56827.wav	lets say if there are m number of rows and n number of columns	test
audio_0_157763.wav	If on the other hand, the committee record is found, then what may happen is that not all the records, not all the rights in that may have actually traversed to the database	test
audio_0_104930.wav	So, the header files that comes from the standard library or system header files, must come, must be specified with these kinds of angular brackets	test
audio_0_60058.wav	so if it is a two thousand by two thousand grid, you have to maintain the two thousand by two thousand array to store this status of each of this cells, right, ok, so these are the advantages	test
audio_0_103985.wav	So, with this set get idiom as you can see that we can create a very fine grain control on the accessibility of the data members and similar accessibility of different methods can also be done, but certainly get set is a is a typical idiom that works for data members to allow you to do more finite things	test
audio_0_99999.wav	Certainly, you will need to have certain initialization functions that work for every structure type	test
audio_0_161184.wav	So for each of these there are factorial n combinations which are all different	test
audio_0_151523.wav	We started the first question to be topical characteristics, second one to be the engagement characteristics, third one to be emotional exchanges, and the fourth one to be cognitive and social orientation	test

audio_0_228514.wav	All the measurements should be given in 3 parts	test
audio_0_222390.wav	So, therefore, the graph is connected first of all every vertex will get into the queue	test
audio_0_31296.wav	So, all the hard work was done by the gentlemen Bessel for us, we just have to carefully adopt his solution ok	test
audio_0_25898.wav	So, we say if b is in the scores, dot keys if we have b as an existing key then we append the score otherwise we create a new entry	test
audio_0_13931.wav	9848 because power factor is 0	test
audio_0_146979.wav	The rest of the adjacency matrix is also filled in similar manner	test
audio_0_236231.wav	I will remove the word, Thai, here, from here	test
audio_0_217188.wav	take ah, ah, to see how the vibration profile of the system looks like	test
audio_0_236205.wav	So, that is what, utilitarianism says	test
audio_0_161502.wav	Now, after that there are some more log entries, etc	test
audio_0_11210.wav	And if you look into the, if you look into this diagram right, so cos theta will be cos theta will be this is my base I m, I m will be cancel right, by root over R square plus 1 upon omega c square, this is cos theta	test
audio_0_160448.wav	So in column based storage, what is essentially done is that the first attribute of all the tuples are stored	test
audio_0_33765.wav	Yeah we just mean that e cross	test
audio_0_84218.wav	33 microseconds	test
audio_0_20259.wav	Now let us learn and discuss a few more concepts and then we will again go back to further cases	test
audio_0_174504.wav	If students are to be motivated and equipped to continue teaching themselves their formal education must go beyond presentation of predetermined content	test
audio_0_181532.wav	You would not see a cell tower quite like this, but this is what you would find in typical cellular deployment	test
audio_0_171359.wav	You will simply take the denominator and equate it to 0 and you try to find out the roots of this particular expression	test
audio_0_78975.wav	So, think of doing an experiment in which you make a gel a hydrogen and you given stiffness and you tweak the height of thickness of the gel and you plate cells on top	test
audio_0_40967.wav	So, these are the topics that we will cover in this module, we’ll start with some physical intuition about how and where wave seem to bend that such the motivation	test
audio_0_86779.wav	Similarly, you could also check that the mylib int in this get mylib int is also replaced to point to the correct address of mylib int	test
audio_0_174465.wav	Document the feedback given on a presented activity	test
audio_0_97570.wav	If you look at x in class C, it is again the same logic that this is private in A, therefore, you cannot access it; you cannot access it either in class D, because it is private in A, clear	test
audio_0_130940.wav	there will be large number of risers through which steam water mixture will come to this theme drum and will get separated	test
audio_0_166532.wav	Now these 3 combinations that is series, parallel and cascaded combinations are very important for the circuit analysis, so we will see now how we can utilise these parameters when we interconnect the various networks either in series, parallel or cascaded manner	test
audio_0_69633.wav	you know, different neurons have different requirements will come in the specialized section	test
audio_0_213790.wav	um, why r s s i is not a good idea	test
audio_0_172605.wav	It consists of Action, Knowledge, Condition, and Criterion	test
audio_0_223047.wav	So, we have 25 percent saving, so this is what we are trying to get at	test
audio_0_40923.wav	Either it will come from measurement	test
audio_0_199456.wav	And in this particular circuit this I 0 divides between r d and rl in inverse ratio of their values	test
audio_0_215599.wav	look at this picture, ok, or look at this picture	test
audio_0_216317.wav	ok, so this paper is actually saying something nice of you	test
audio_0_174271.wav	And in the earlier unit we looked at what is the nature of complex engineering problems and we noted that they are significantly different from the end chapter difficult problems because problems can be simple and difficult but a difficult problem does not become a complex engineering problem	test
audio_0_34981.wav	Alright so, now, let us move on the next module and we will look at is Absorbing Boundary Conditions ok	test
audio_0_82145.wav	So, you see here in front of me it is a DC power supply, if I remove this, you can see very clearly, what is there is a DC power supply	test
audio_0_58956.wav	we can only increase our confidence in the corerct working of the circuit and and there is an auxiliary process which is also involved, called verification	test
audio_0_124313.wav	to find the norton current source we have to short circuit this two terminals and find the current going through the short circuit	test
audio_0_4523.wav	So, this is your ammeter your what you call reading of the ammeter A 2	test
audio_0_60672.wav	these two edges are there between the	test
audio_0_75804.wav	and then inside within the slow speckle zone you have mixture of both red and green dots	test
audio_0_188934.wav	So, let us take one particular case of fraud detection for example, so, whenever we go and use our credit card we buy something and the credit card gets charged	test
audio_0_19811.wav	Now this data will be useful for making projections	test
audio_0_174203.wav	So if you have the concepts well, you should be able to perform something and that performing or the behavior should be written which can be demonstrated	test
audio_0_40635.wav	No in FDTD again there are two formulations, total field formulation and scattered field formulation and depending on the formulation, we will apply the boundary condition to only the scattered field or the total field	test
audio_0_231403.wav	Handling procrastination obviously will relieve you from stress and it will make you cool	test
audio_0_157755.wav	What does undoing essentially do is that the transaction, this is the failed transaction, but it has may have already written some values to the database assuming it is going to be correct	test
audio_0_146259.wav	Here as soon as a task releases the resource, the CSC is again checked with all the tasks that are under, all the resources that are under use and the ceiling is set to the maximum of that	test
audio_0_51319.wav	however, whatever comes on the red side, it goes little slow	test
audio_0_53446.wav	they should be equal to one half v one, u reflected plus one half v two, u transmitted, which is indeed what the energy flow is	test
audio_0_87304.wav	The output of this command is the GOT table for this particular function, note that the contents at an offset of 16 bytes is c203 which in little Indian notations stands for 0x3c2	test
audio_0_41082.wav	Now, one thing I want to caution you this idea of what is called transverse magnetic and what is called transverse electric, you will find two different conventions in the literature	test
audio_0_95384.wav	so one of the key aspects of soft skills is effective communication	test
audio_0_156585.wav	So this essentially means that the form being is that transaction T1 reads A	test
audio_0_119288.wav	so, def, map, so l is the least	test
audio_0_142385.wav	So, we already knew that there is a fall of 2,000 from balance sheet in the bank balance	test
audio_0_135814.wav	And, one of the most significant figures within this group was the historian Ranajit Guha	test
audio_0_166134.wav	Now, what next we have to do the terminals across which we have just found the Thevenin equivalent we have to add the load	test
audio_0_184453.wav	And a sufficient condition that will satisfy that, is setting the integrand equal to 0	test
audio_0_216172.wav	the database ah, essentially is this is the fire base, as i mentioned to you	test
audio_0_220280.wav	So, it is enough to look at points inside the zone on both sides	test
audio_0_182011.wav	We showed that under this assumption the capacity went up to 192	test
audio_0_176868.wav	Single brand retailing and multi brand retailing are two types of retailing in India	test
audio_0_199742.wav	But we know that it appears between drain and ground, so eventually it will appear in parallel with RD and RL	test
audio_0_142487.wav	So, we have taken these slides from that	test
audio_0_176297.wav	That is broadly the apply activity in engineering that we see	test
audio_0_122004.wav	So, let's unpack this particular flashback because this is very important as it captures the first crisis between the owner of the shop and the central character Ravata	test
audio_0_225809.wav	Today, we will see that some other NP problems can also be reduced each other	test
audio_0_220827.wav	So, there are many different strategies that people use and very often experimentally they arrive at some combination of strategies	test
audio_0_144275.wav	Again I would request you to download these IAS if you have interest and then go through them in detail	test
audio_0_230161.wav	So, if I know to draw this, then I can to a large extent general I say that, I can draw any complex structures	test
audio_0_60691.wav	so at every step you are doing some kind of a you can say bi partitioning: divide it up into two, but a several such partitioning you are doing repeatedly	test
audio_0_43165.wav	Proportional to r cube, what is the surface area proportional to	test
audio_0_38588.wav	And our objective is that in the presence of I A, I mean in the presence of the other antenna tell me what is Z 1 d tell me what is Z 2 d ok	test

audio_0_134390.wav	James theory further says,I again quote him that “the bodily changes following directly the perception of an exciting fact, and that are feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion	test
audio_0_14801.wav	If the switch is closed for long time means, this switch was closed for long time right and that t your what you call t is equal to 0, the switch is just opened otherwise it was close	test
audio_0_30178.wav	So, the lot of avoidance behavior which is seen in phobia	test
audio_0_188041.wav	I have the fitted values, and I know the mean which is y bar of the bid price	test
audio_0_72254.wav	At the end of development, maybe the existing functionalities might have changed	test
audio_0_178771.wav	So, we will let us see; what is it that we can give	test
audio_0_41438.wav	So, this is the maximum that an edge can be shared by is; obviously, by 2 elements right	test
audio_0_35978.wav	m plus n from FEM n from boundary integral	test
audio_0_99000.wav	And then you will have to write this where in it will be understood that this is a typename and this is a name of a variable declaration, a pointer variable declaration in this case	test
audio_0_95755.wav	so in such a situation, telephone helps in saving time and also it also helps from the regards of the journey	test
audio_0_158439.wav	If however the database is in the same machine then there is no network communication but in general it can be done	test
audio_0_147419.wav	It will be interesting if you can actually download it and play around with it	test
audio_0_128485.wav	then you will be left with only independent sources and resistors or controlled sources	test
audio_0_14636.wav	Next one is determine the current, in 10 ohm resistor of the circuit shown in see figure 63 by Norton's theorem	test
audio_0_4554.wav	18 a, this pass upper one this 18 a	test
audio_0_121040.wav	And he says he, there is Ravda knows how to calculate, but he is an idiot	test
audio_0_176763.wav	And it is better to keep him in a twin sharing so that there is someone else also who can raise an alarm if required	test
audio_0_6.wav	So, then you Genichi Taguchi was actually a tail engineer by a training, but he work for the you know electrical corporation ECL in Japan and you know does tried to he was a you to actually converted statistician and he tried to develop some methodologies for doing quality for analysis etc	test
audio_0_149346.wav	So, you type import j s o n	test
audio_0_175005.wav	You cannot undo all this at any given point so you have to work with them or work around them to achieve your learning goals	test
audio_0_42465.wav	So, I am redefining the operator in this	test
audio_0_225607.wav	So, we have U and whatever it is connected to	test
audio_0_159984.wav	So certain machines, so wherever the queries land up in those memory of those machines can be used as a cache	test
audio_0_80433.wav	Now this is very easy, because this is nothing but a potential divider voltage divider circuit	test
audio_0_152650.wav	No, that is an expression of content superiority	test
audio_0_101998.wav	So, all static objects get constructed before main starts	test
audio_0_152450.wav	There was some data collected to understand the privacy perceptions in India	test
audio_0_223498.wav	Because, they must occur in the same sequence, so if a 0 match to b 2, a 1 something match into the right, a 2 must match something still for the right and so on	test
audio_0_26411.wav	So, what an inorder traversal does is that it first explores the left side	test
audio_0_71968.wav	But then let's look at some non software examples of projects	test
audio_0_101657.wav	So, actually I have a combination of three into three nine combinations and a there may be several live class which have the same base class parent	test
audio_0_31988.wav	What do you have to do	test
audio_0_102875.wav	Whatever you decide to do is the basic handling of the exception	test
audio_0_174463.wav	Give feedback on a presented activity	test

audio_0_187402.wav	So, this is correct identification of positive labels	test
audio_0_135317.wav	Let us first understand that Hermann Ebbinghaus was the first psychologist who conducted experiments on forgetting	test
audio_0_100327.wav	So, this object can now be used for chain assignment, as I have explained	test
audio_0_181089.wav	So, if I have another observation if R is the maximum distance or the side of a hexagon it also happens to be the distance from the center to any of the vertices	test
audio_0_172867.wav	But this can be done if you have a software tool implementing this should not be difficult at all	test
audio_0_39615.wav	That is why the source was put at the minus 7 not at minus 8 because you do not want source in the material you wanted just outside ok	test
audio_0_195239.wav	We don't have to worry about exactly the shape of the current or the voltage	test
audio_0_91793.wav	And now it is much simpler to work with	test
audio_0_34926.wav	Inductor or capacitor right	test
audio_0_232284.wav	Now, check your answers, check your score very quickly and then the score and your status in terms of your English Skills	test

audio_0_202805.wav	The projector C if that is the case from projector 30 mm I have to give and go ahead construct this below 25 mm	test
audio_0_228121.wav	So, bellow helps us this bellow; this bellow helps us to save it from the dust to keep it secure from dust	test
audio_0_172652.wav	We have not put any criteria	test
audio_0_9272.wav	So, what you can do it you try to find out what will be v upon i1 what will be your v upon your i1 right	test
audio_0_72899.wav	We will take up in the next lecture and we will complete our discussion on the development life cycles in the next lecture	test
audio_0_100314.wav	So, we would like to do deep copy, in this case we are doing a deep copy	test
audio_0_61814.wav	so this is seven, eighty one ohm and one picofarad, is split into five hundred and five hundred one stitch pi	test
audio_0_75342.wav	So, for a positive photomask see if you go back to the example earlier, if this is your positive photomask then your eventual product at the end of it your light is going to pass through this	test
audio_0_113758.wav	So, that time we call steady state is reached, and generally the transient time is quite small	test
audio_0_61622.wav	so you will be getting a virtually a channel less layout of standard cell, which will be much more compact again	test
audio_0_205841.wav	If we are showing that without any’s dashes it indicates that it is a top view	test
audio_0_96400.wav	of course, sometimes you become ambiguous, but, as i have been saying, ambiguity maybe a quality in terms of literature, in terms of our everyday gossip, but when it comes to writing, especially for business, ambiguity is quite an unwelcome guest	test
audio_0_29759.wav	Like cases of domestic violence	test
audio_0_164197.wav	So, you will simply write rth	test
audio_0_182503.wav	So, this is the point at which we then say, now where do you find random sequences and we said the random sequences do not exist	test
audio_0_195048.wav	All we have to do is put them in series	test
audio_0_26103.wav	It is very simple, you use a python library called random which allows you some functions to generate random numbers and one of the things that this library has is this function randrange	test
audio_0_203425.wav	So, you will be in a position to draw a center line	test
audio_0_182904.wav	We have come at it from two very different aspects	test
audio_0_221042.wav	It is useful to remember, that 2 to the 10 is 1000	test
audio_0_235581.wav	People, need people, who can really work	test
audio_0_233601.wav	The second aspect of learning a skill, is behavior modelling	test
audio_0_148644.wav	Again success rate, how people react to these emails what level of authentication, what is the percentage of people who are actually giving their account details, is what they show in this graph	test
audio_0_110002.wav	Already, we have seen that this also that we can put a maximum value of the reflection coefficient that gives us this expression	test
audio_0_33510.wav	So, let us number our equations was 1 2 3 4 ok	test
audio_0_217498.wav	this is something that you can typically use for all measurement of in in automobiles	test
audio_0_235326.wav	And, we have talked about, what human resources is	test
audio_0_153994.wav	It is also brief it takes into consideration the eye and the mouth normally very occasionally and very briefly it can have a look towards the neck side also	test
audio_0_16269.wav	So, at the start the start branch is neglected right just for the it is a simplification right	test
audio_0_219078.wav	So, we will look at this with a little more detail in our last lecture	test
audio_0_6410.wav	So, this 4 ampere current actually directly you will go through this your short circuit your path, because in this case it will be ineffective it will be ineffective and in this at the same case your i, if it is ineffective means this i x dash will be 0 and i dash will be 0	test
audio_0_86782.wav	So, the limitations for the Load Time relocatable technique is that it has extremely slow Load time, since, essentially we have the loader which passes through each and every location which needs to be modified and fills and replaces the zeros in that location with the actual address	test
audio_0_173081.wav	And then you have to come to, you have to reach substantiated conclusions	test
audio_0_204433.wav	So, adjust the scale carefully and draw a parallel line	test
audio_0_217801.wav	all right, so lets start with the standard: ah, publish subscribe, because this is based on the publish subscribe architecture	test
audio_0_104510.wav	F was defined in A and there is over head name B	test
audio_0_75256.wav	So, in both these treatments your contractility should go down	test
audio_0_188407.wav	Now we said in the previous slide that x 1 x 2 can be written as A inverse b	test
audio_0_113080.wav	5 Giga hertz, a short placed at load plane	test
audio_0_224201.wav	So, here is the corresponding pseudo code, so the first step is to initialise the in degree to 0 for every vertex in our graph, then we go through all the edges	test
audio_0_56888.wav	we are following this sequence: zero, then another zero, then a one, then another one, then a zero, another zero, one, then another one, and so on	test
audio_0_30935.wav	e equal to 2	test
audio_0_53625.wav	e cross b is coming out here and going in here, because b is like this	test
audio_0_29680.wav	So, the basic emotive content of any debate or any action is aggression, what we are trying to focus	test
audio_0_37806.wav	So, the first term over here will become minus M equivalent minus j omega mu naught H s right the second term becomes what do I have over here minus J and I have a minus j omega epsilon naught s	test
audio_0_216209.wav	this is a batteryless system, so n f c energy from the phone, energy from the phone is being transferred to the embedded module using the n f c coil and ah	test
audio_0_19668.wav	Firstly, whatever is available with us is a current budget we have put it in proper format	test
audio_0_180261.wav	So, the understanding is that coherent detection will do better than differential detection in a fading channel	test
audio_0_33517.wav	So, this is equation 6 right if E plus j omega A is of the form let us say minus grad phi then 6 is always true ok	test
audio_0_121693.wav	So, Ambe is sitting and doing the calculation of a number of things and Murugan is reciting the price of each and every material	test
audio_0_183330.wav	So, Eb by n naught is equal to Ps by Pn into one half and if I were to express it in dB, Eb by n naught dB is equal to Ps by Pn in dB minus 3 dB	test
audio_0_93395.wav	here you do not know, i mean, there is no specificity and that is why it is an indefinite pronoun	test
audio_0_149332.wav	Now we say data is equal to requests dot get URL	test
audio_0_21674.wav	80 minus 60 minus 10, so per unit is 10, 24,000 into 10	test
audio_0_219325.wav	So, there are some positive edges and there are some negative edges, and the other situation is completely unrelated to anything we have seen so far	test
audio_0_55569.wav	delta l can be the change in the wire length that have been taking place between these two iterations and this will be the impact of the change in wire wire, wire length and the delay, some factor that, multiplied by delta l, you subtract this one slack k minus one	test
audio_0_53612.wav	finally, when we are talking about the energy content, linear momentum content, of the electromagnetic field, i will conclude this set of three lectures by showing that e m fields carry angular momentum also	test
audio_0_142262.wav	Normally it is a financing activity but interest on a working capital loan will be an operating activity	test
audio_0_90501.wav	So, in a typical Trusted Execution Environment we assume that the operating system itself is compromised and thus the entire system may be compromised	test
audio_0_166841.wav	So what is the value of current	test
audio_0_166290.wav	So, individual loop gains you have got like we discussed	test
audio_0_147531.wav	So, if you look at the concept of finding out what citizens are worried about, what citizens are talking about, I will go through some tweets what we so to say in terms of actually looking at what posts the citizens are doing, how we can actually take out some useful information from these posts	test
audio_0_135099.wav	Yes p is also the distracter	test
audio_0_79252.wav	So, this brings us to the question you have so many different focal adhesion proteins hundreds of them	test
audio_0_29700.wav	They do suicidal attempts	test
audio_0_202485.wav	So, on drawing sheet symbols dimensioning these units are the most important thing, if you want to convey a picture to machinist	test
audio_0_58384.wav	the boolean difference with respect to one of the variables, let say x, i is defined as follows: we denoted as the differential notation d, f, d, x, i	test
audio_0_182404.wav	Now, we already wrote down this property, but I just, after we wrote down in the form of chips will this property hold	test
audio_0_40938.wav	So, you have to do this numerically right	test
audio_0_206706.wav	One of the possibility is from frontal view, we can see that there is something like this kind of block, which is imaginary, so we can join along with our this one	test
audio_0_19255.wav	Now we need to charge this indirect cost also	test
audio_0_159500.wav	Again if the independence is violated then this doesn't work out but that's fine	test
audio_0_98108.wav	So, once I am done, the compiler will resolve that you have called this function	test
audio_0_93728.wav	for example, if the boss said, mister x, the propositions or, uh, the product that you have written, it actually it is, it is a very early project	test
audio_0_172063.wav	So, what we will do will first find out what would be the value of I in this particular arrangement	test
audio_0_132588.wav	if it is heated water, then what we will have, this heater you know this room heaters which circulate heated water or warm water that is what we are going to use in the factory floor	test
audio_0_224314.wav	So, how do I combine two sorted list or two sorted arrays A and B into a third sorted list C	test
audio_0_92255.wav	There is another terminology used here the line integral as circulation	test
audio_0_219487.wav	We also said that the longest common subsequence problem that we saw earlier is useful in Genetics, in Bioinformatics and in the same way edit distance also, if you want to compare the genetic information in two different species, then it is natural to become to compare them in terms of the content of the DNA and DNA are just long strips	test
audio_0_230065.wav	So, these are the 2 slip gauges	test
audio_0_201131.wav	We have already evaluated them roughly but we will see that in detail	test
audio_0_40170.wav	So, the left hand side is simply going to give me, so it G prime	test
audio_0_92526.wav	So, here, we define the sequence of the partial sums that means instead of infinity, we will take finite number of terms, so, we have just replaced that infinity by n to have these n terms of the series together with the first term and let us call this sum as fn	test
audio_0_93636.wav	but having the willingness to adapt, we can adapt, and nowadays several organizations they want an employee who can adapt to the changing needs of the organization	test
audio_0_12703.wav	So, 30 into 6 30 into 60 900 by R 1 plus R 2 plus R 3 so, it is 18 ohm right, because 30 into 60 divided by 100 18 ohm	test
audio_0_20871.wav	When I said separate budget, it's a part of the whole budget but for that particular department a particular portion is given that is known as a functional budget	test
audio_0_40039.wav	So, these this known term over here this is what is going to give me a non zero right hand side	test
audio_0_197352.wav	This could be let's say some 100 millivolt sign omega T or maybe 1 volt sine omega T	test
audio_0_135024.wav	So, one is a beginning	test
audio_0_23627.wav	I had a lot of fun putting these videos together for you	test
audio_0_206794.wav	And there should be a line this one this one supposed to be visible	test
audio_0_207292.wav	So, if you are pressing escape, the object has been constructed	test
audio_0_107081.wav	Universities also contributed in a way that the IP that protected the initial research could be developed into new products	test
audio_0_231921.wav	Now, when I pronounce, you can slightly understand the difference	test
audio_0_30253.wav	Right, this happens in this house, this happens in this house and therefore, if it happens in my house it is normal	test
audio_0_98335.wav	One of these function, this one has two parameters, the parameter x as here is int, parameter y is also int	test
audio_0_59522.wav	ok, so the first thing is that in static timing analysis we have to annotate the primary inputs by saying that when the inputs are transiting or changing state	test
audio_0_83787.wav	Now, in this particular module what we will see is feed back in op amps all right and then further applications also If you come on the screen what do you see is that If you have a op amp and if it is a open loop op amp like this, right, the internal formula of op amp is V out equals to gain into difference of the input terminals; that means, that my V out is nothing, but difference of this; difference of this difference of what V inverting on non inverting minus V inverting into gain	test
audio_0_96690.wav	In terms of the object oriented futures in C++ we have already seen how classes can be defined and how objects of a certain class can be instantiated	test
audio_0_60098.wav	of course you have to keep some information about the obstacles in your data structure, that these are the places where some obstacles are there	test
audio_0_72914.wav	Net profit is defined as the value of all the cost cash flows for the life of the lifetime of the application	test
audio_0_212095.wav	this is like one node and this is the other node right now	test
audio_0_66571.wav	so its the same analogy as i gave you out here	test
audio_0_110994.wav	5 you make 3 rotations that will be 1	test
audio_0_199654.wav	Because this is usually not what is taught in basic circuits classes	test
audio_0_58874.wav	l square by four and l square by four, it will be k, l square by two	test
audio_0_199786.wav	Similarly, for C2 appear like a short circuit, it should be such that its reactants is much smaller than whatever appears across it	test
audio_0_178805.wav	So, basically it is a, so his is why this particular method of combining instead of calling it co phasing, we call it equal gain combining	test
audio_0_21540.wav	Now it was given that raw material required of A and B is 12 and 10 respectively for one unit of finished goods	test
audio_0_51137.wav	with this background, what you want to focus on is again, waves from this time which are harmonic and plane waves	test
audio_0_58395.wav	ok, so there are two conditions for detection of a fault	test
audio_0_134675.wav	Echoic retention the moment you have now two sounds of equal intensity masculine will take place	test
audio_0_63173.wav	let us see with the help of an example so i have worked out an example numerically, but here i am showing it diagrammatically what happens	test
audio_0_34200.wav	What do we start with what was absolute starting point for FDTD before Yee cell	test
audio_0_59121.wav	so this will represent your a	test
audio_0_228809.wav	So, Control Charts for Attributes, first chart I will pick is the P chart	test
audio_0_95943.wav	but then you can also follow the practice of writing as i said in the earlier lecture	test
audio_0_102900.wav	For example, I have this code which, please do not bother about what the code does, but just look at fact that there are two labels used here	test
audio_0_129183.wav	ok, if i call the c one and c two, so eventually i have only rx, l and c one plus c two in parallel	test
audio_0_63936.wav	you see just one property of these n type and p type transistors	test
audio_0_153761.wav	France is a relatively crowded society and the people experience greater physical contact	test
audio_0_153190.wav	Suppose this is a salt shaker or ketchup bottle unconsciously try to put it slightly over this side of the other person so, that the space on your side of the table is maximized	test
audio_0_10270.wav	Now, therefore, nu max is equal to if you put W i is equal to your x square W c right; that means, x square W c is equal to W i if you put in this expression; x square W c is equal to W i	test
audio_0_47268.wav	You can just put a diode is sufficient because the relay coils have very large resistance with the order of 10 to 12 ooms so that will dissipate and the power comes immediately the relay is also the resistor is in action and after some time the relay will come back into action once again in a similar way so this is how the relay can help in limiting the search current	test
audio_0_219229.wav	So, before we look at the complexity of these algorithms, we actually first have to verify that it is correct	test
audio_0_205013.wav	We are covering Module number 4, Lecture number 38, it is about Orthographic Projections especially Projection of planes	test
audio_0_92823.wav	So, here just another observation that if we have a closed path, we have the simply connected domain and there we have taken a closed path C, so, what will happen here the b and a are the same the initial and the endpoints are same	test
audio_0_117461.wav	so there is a risk of ah multi tenancy	test
audio_0_159428.wav	So how are the values for that attribute A are distributed	test
audio_0_70029.wav	So, I say I want to play it in a cover slip whatever size I am not defining that at this stage, I say I want to plate say for example, let us take a number now	test
audio_0_94632.wav	now, when you have understood the various requirements of a resume, let us say how to draft an effective resume	test
audio_0_223837.wav	Now, we have N bookings and every possible subset of this is a sub problem, so we have an exponential number of sub problems	test
audio_0_54164.wav	this v goes to, goes as one over r	test
audio_0_179403.wav	The challenge is how do you get the maximum out of channels which are which are not so good in terms of SNR, that is what we are going to be addressing today	test
audio_0_37243.wav	So, we will see that the same logic there is nothing special there is no special preference to space over time	test
audio_0_83114.wav	So, noise can either be generated internally in the top in the op amp from its associated passive components or super imposed by circuit by the external sources	test
audio_0_238178.wav	You transfer it online	test
audio_0_1575.wav	Each conductor in figure 11 will experience a force I told you how it will experience	test
audio_0_167147.wav	To find the Laplace transform of the complete feedback system	test
audio_0_117921.wav	what we say is not only or libraries, which allows you to have some sort of a data analytics and data services out of it	test
audio_0_98061.wav	6 has to match exactly with one of them, so that I can say that at particular function is getting called	test
audio_0_73089.wav	So when a candidate system is developed, the initial cost or normally usually exceed those of the return current system, this is an investment period, obvious	test
audio_0_31982.wav	So, you should whatever book you pick up make sure you go right to the beginning and see what is the time convention they have used	test
audio_0_155034.wav	We can quote the example of Marilyn Monroe who is known for her breathy voice	test
audio_0_166109.wav	That means that our initial direction of current was clockwise but finally the direction of current is anti clockwise	test
audio_0_99914.wav	So, since the static type is p A naturally it looks into the class A for the binding and the dynamic type being A clearly tell us that certainly, in all of this cases all these will actually invoke the class A functions	test
audio_0_151459.wav	Now, when you look at the Clusters of Topic, here when police initiated discussions are more focused than citizen initiated, let us see how; and why we are actually making this conclusion which is, when police starts the discussion it is more specific about topics, awareness drive, safety campaigns which is specifically talking about	test
audio_0_109764.wav	Now there are some packaging materials there are unique to a particular product that can also be covered	test
audio_0_104078.wav	Base will need to be constructed, derived will need to be constructed and so on	test
audio_0_196402.wav	When VSD equals 3 volts, it rises up to 50 microamperors and stays that way in saturation region	test
audio_0_33657.wav	So, I mean if you want be very particular if I do the intersection of this, this is the null set ok	test
audio_0_234719.wav	And, I have used a few research papers	test
audio_0_234864.wav	We are all human	test
audio_0_37548.wav	So, let us now let us do testing with	test
audio_0_152841.wav	In fact, Joe Navarro who has authored a very popular book entitled, What Everybody is Saying has commented that despite having learnt language, over millions of years, human brain is still hardwired to actually, communicating our emotions and thoughts and sentiments with the help of our hands	test
audio_0_93221.wav	dear friends, lets see that interview which you appear at, even if you fail, it also has a meaning	test
audio_0_151518.wav	006 to 0	test
audio_0_142553.wav	Already they were suffering losses in operations further losses because of stocking prices	test
audio_0_203901.wav	Now, remove that circle, ok	test
audio_0_204861.wav	One of them is called chain dimensioning	test
audio_0_104862.wav	And, what will you see	test
audio_0_191098.wav	And, now if f is in the kernel, now if f is in the kernel of phi 2 then f of 2 is 0 right	test
audio_0_78007.wav	So, paxillin and vinculin are paxillin and FAK are way less than talin or vinculin and lowest very close to zero is integrins	test
audio_0_101422.wav	So, this behavior if you look at then this behavior is already very clear to you	test
audio_0_102746.wav	But in the second case, I am trying to do something different earlier I try to take an int and construct an a object	test
audio_0_20385.wav	That is one of the oldest ways of classifying the cost	test
audio_0_68671.wav	So, have these backups ready, the day you fix these cylinders maintain a log buffer and on top of that put a stick sticker, telling that fixed on say you know day month year	test
audio_0_128280.wav	ok, so i wont vary abutted, and i have normalize the left hand side so that the coefficient of vc is one	test
audio_0_238767.wav	We bring them in	test
audio_0_161879.wav	So this is start of T T which you can also say this is start of the execution phase of T	test
audio_0_146671.wav	So first, let's check the Liu Lejevskis condition for the first task	test
audio_0_178697.wav	Now how do we do that	test
audio_0_228826.wav	Random sample were taken and some defective pieces of nuts and bolts were obtained and as tabulated below	test
audio_0_145135.wav	But in many situations, not many, but then in some situations, the deadline and the period can be different	test
audio_0_122764.wav	He will never see the world the same anymore	test
audio_0_188446.wav	Now you can notice that I can take any value for x 2 and then calculate an x 1, which will satisfy this equation	test
audio_0_83238.wav	So, if you come back to the screen, so if I have an opamp in the following configuration, in the following schematic or following circuit, then what I see is that I am applying an input to the inverting as well as non inverting amplifier correct applying an input to the inverting as well as non inverting terminal of the amplifier	test
audio_0_64955.wav	i one, w i two, w i three and w i four	test
audio_0_171378.wav	Now initial values and final value theorems shows the relationship between origin and the infinity in the time domain as well as in the s domain	test
audio_0_101820.wav	So, if we are; whenever you are using C, now you should always the bool type and not use int and interpret it as a bool type	test
audio_0_186519.wav	So, the second observation is also assigned to group 1 and you will notice through this process a third and fourth will be assigned to group 1 and 5 6 7 8 will be assigned to group 2 because these distances are less than these distances	test
audio_0_152628.wav	At the same time there may be other display rules which are considered to be more personal	test
audio_0_179259.wav	So, the high SNR approximation the probability of error of BPSK in Rayleigh fading under high SNR, I would like you to verify comes out to be 1 by 4 gamma is also a linear slope it is a goes down with a slop of minus one, but it has got a different constant with respect to differential BPSK	test
audio_0_35591.wav	So, what would you do now very critical step in a any computation	test
audio_0_149619.wav	You can create a user account, so that you can save the graphs that we generate using this platform	test
audio_0_203417.wav	For example, I would like to have a height of 50 millimeters	test
audio_0_110756.wav	And, path, set of consecutive co directional branches, along which no node is traversed more than once, as moved from independent to dependent variable	test
audio_0_63089.wav	ok, so i think with this way we come to the end of this second lecture	test
audio_0_191900.wav	You can replace Z by any UFD R, and all the definitions and theorems we gave today carry over to that	test
audio_0_103273.wav	So, if you do not expect an instance of this class, you do not expect that the class itself is doing some computation using the data members	test
audio_0_206844.wav	Now, let us look at how to construct a triangle and what are those isometric projections	test
audio_0_7890.wav	So, 2 into 6 is equal to 12 volt right	test
audio_0_131616.wav	so the ratio of the power gives the efficiency, but in this case it is an issue of energies, right	test
audio_0_100602.wav	Second it is a language mechanism rather than of the library, that is the language should at the core take of the fact that errors can happen exceptions will need to be managed and therefore provide a language feature for doing that	test
audio_0_240046.wav	As a teacher, I can be as informed as possible	test
audio_0_40324.wav	So, when we write this expression out over here, you can see that there are double derivatives second order derivatives	test
audio_0_135546.wav	We also have to ask how did the Africans react to this European attempt to divide up their lands into European colonies	test
audio_0_146544.wav	So this is an example of a single priority inversion and the time for which the task T1 gets blocked is between T3 and T4, where the task T3 completes users of its critical resource	test
audio_0_209995.wav	So, rotate that object so that it comes out to be in that shape, in the natural method	test
audio_0_118290.wav	then we have discussed, ah i, i believe, one or two lectures on cloud resource management in cloud, right, so its a, its a very important issue, right, resources, resource management in the cloud is, is play a both from the providers and particularly also sometimes it is from the consumer end	test
audio_0_59443.wav	so we continue with a discussion on timing closure	test
audio_0_196143.wav	This is delta V2, this would be delta I2 and this would be delta I1	test
audio_0_30054.wav	Some people get this obsessive impulses that as if they murder somebody, they will not or blasphemous obsession in they see gods picture and all sexual thoughts keep coming in	test
audio_0_19725.wav	So, the total contribution to be earned becomes 95 lakhs, 20,000	test
audio_0_30247.wav	Where one way of looking at it could be that whatever majority of people do, that is normal	test
audio_0_178920.wav	Because we have assumed only CSIR, does not know gamma of n	test
audio_0_224242.wav	Now I have to compare, what is the top most elements in the two stacks; can be 32 and 55	test
audio_0_181356.wav	So, there is a node that operators have created which is before you get to the gateway	test
audio_0_217942.wav	so, but if you want to ensure that the broker actually has to retain that message on itself, then you use this session id accordingly	test
audio_0_220159.wav	It is not the old setup, where we have to scan all the nodes 1 to n in order to decide which one is not because we have the list members	test
audio_0_141767.wav	Other earnings, again they are earnings, so not a part of balance sheet, give it as N	test
audio_0_60117.wav	ok, lets take an example like this: hm, see this example	test
audio_0_225314.wav	So, whether to make i point to j or j point to i, so this is an order 1 operation and that is because we have the size information tell us the size, we do not have a go through the component to find it size and we have this root information it directly tells us where the roots of the two partition are	test
audio_0_196139.wav	We will know what it is	test
audio_0_60605.wav	here i am showing very log descriptions of a simple decoder, a two to four decoder	test
audio_0_204771.wav	Similarly, d point this one and this d point coincides, so join by line	test
audio_0_123860.wav	now the point is during: clearly see that if z one two equals z two one right, then y one two will also be equal to y two one	test
audio_0_227431.wav	So, this can be the kind of sensitivity of this instrument, ok	test
audio_0_64167.wav	so here we are, more saying that we want to design everything from scratch, but, as i said, in practice today, very really, we do that because of the very high cost and time involved for that	test
audio_0_173078.wav	You have to research the literature and identify the relevant literature and study that	test
audio_0_94392.wav	you have an individual responsibility	test
audio_0_8967.wav	So, solving equation 1 and 2, you will get v 1 is equal to 10	test
audio_0_222870.wav	So, the height difference can go from 1 to 2 or when you increase you can make the height difference, again go from 1 to 2	test
audio_0_16297.wav	So, P is given 6, f is equal to 50 hertz, f is equal to 2 hertz and we know f 2 in equal to S f, so S is equal to f 2 upon f	test
audio_0_62964.wav	here, as you can see, we have drawn this imaginary circles	test
audio_0_173561.wav	That is by survey with your alumni where exactly they are after four to five years	test
audio_0_73648.wav	We have to a generic model is there and why we want to customize it according to our own needs	test
audio_0_57294.wav	so this will be like a clock gating where normally clocks will be coming	test
audio_0_197078.wav	The source being part of both the controlling and control side accomplishes feedback	test
audio_0_86528.wav	So, x slash x with dumped memory corresponding to this location FFFFCF18 and as we have seen before this particular memory location corresponds to where RET is stored	test
audio_0_178851.wav	Now, CSIR the case 2 that we studied the clarification or the a point to be taken away is, if I say that I have I have CSIR and I want to achieve ergodic capacity, what is the method	test
audio_0_190830.wav	So, a 1 is an I n 1, a 2 is, n 1 could be 100, a 1 could be a in I 100, a 2 could be in I 23, a 3 could be in I 42, a 4 could be I 205 and so on	test
audio_0_161328.wav	Any other node, every other node will have between theta to 2 theta keys	test
audio_0_193685.wav	So, a greatest common divisor is a common divisor which is divisible by every common divisor	test
audio_0_37673.wav	Getting scattered over here going through over here and then going off over here this is physically what is happening	test
audio_0_60085.wav	now, at every stage we check whether any line from the set l s, whether the intersect l, t or naught	test
audio_0_114227.wav	So, you put that button nowadays in the back side of oscilloscope, it is there earlier days it was at the front side	test
audio_0_30881.wav	So, this is one equation and how many variables will appear over here	test
audio_0_20524.wav	Here we assume that cost change mainly because of volume	test
audio_0_31679.wav	Now, as s infinity is actually at it is far away and our source is fixed over here	test
audio_0_166877.wav	So, now for maximum power transfer condition you got to expression for the condition	test
audio_0_5550.wav	So, we have one 10 volt source, and we have one 50 volt source	test
audio_0_92588.wav	So, hence it is not possible to find this N which depends only on epsilon and therefore the sequence does not converge uniformly to 0	test
audio_0_198688.wav	So, clearly from these two relationships you see that either the impedance of ZB has to decrease with frequency or the impedance of ZA has to increase with frequency when it goes from 0 to omega 0 or both	test
audio_0_60494.wav	so this can be minimized, but this has been kept non means non minimized because of balancing the delays from inputs to outputs	test
audio_0_196632.wav	The point is that the transistor is a unilateral device	test
audio_0_239656.wav	If you see an employee, getting defensive	test
audio_0_116048.wav	fault domain is a collection of servers that share common resources, which are power and network connectivity	test
audio_0_67142.wav	So, that followed by this you can go for what we call as surface chemical analysis, where you will be knowing that which all atoms are or elements of atom	test
audio_0_141333.wav	But what I am trying to tell is debt equity ratio is very important	test
audio_0_111450.wav	That means, Thru when you make through this T in terms of this S parameters, we know	test
audio_0_176067.wav	But that is the framework in which you are using the word knowledge	test
audio_0_57550.wav	earlier we did it by moving a gate around, but here lets see this ten	test
audio_0_3825.wav	So, ah in for this case u t is defined this is unity and and this is like this we have drawn because for t less than 0 it is your 0 so, but at t is equal to 0 your your what you call it is undefined	test
audio_0_107889.wav	Xerox referring to the product that comes out of their machines that is a photostat or a photocopy is again an instance of a trade name being commonly used in identifying the product	test
audio_0_186377.wav	For this course, you are not going to use this tab from much	test
audio_0_119516.wav	so previously we have seen the, that rdbm parser, then disk space management layer, then database file system layer	test
audio_0_60872.wav	so in the earlier case for virtual grid compaction, so i was shifting these, all these four blocks together as the grid was shifting	test
audio_0_231348.wav	So whenever you are given a deadline and then your work will expand so as to feel the time available for its completion	test
audio_0_228186.wav	So, I will come to machine you can see the machine is going to home position by itself	test
audio_0_145635.wav	Can we have a mathematical expression where we substitute values and then we get the result whether it is schedulable or not	test
audio_0_85756.wav	And as we have discussed before, both of these processes execute the same SSL encryption, also what we assume is that both core 1 and core 2 share the same last level cache, so this is a grown up picture of what the cache memory looks like	test
audio_0_65202.wav	so if there are, if there are two different nets, they have to be laid out in a non in a disjoint fashion, with non intersecting line segments	test
audio_0_139180.wav	this is our objective	test
audio_0_165456.wav	Now, this is the transfer function of the system	test
audio_0_31891.wav	So, it is like there are two equations and two variables right	test
audio_0_187836.wav	So, this value is now bounded	test
audio_0_195131.wav	So instead of even computing VDS you can just compare the drain voltage with the gate voltage	test
audio_0_176255.wav	It is only giving examples from your course	test
audio_0_220467.wav	So, let us start at 1, right	test
audio_0_142244.wav	Because of bank, yes, but no other asset is changing	test
audio_0_12271.wav	So, in that case your what you call this is the current flowing your through this is I 1 and current suppose if load is connected, this is I 2 and this if you take in this direction, current will be I 1 minus I 2, but I have taken in this direction	test
audio_0_7841.wav	So, from that you can tell circuit is a linear right	test
audio_0_178887.wav	This is the and the channel that the encoder decoder has been studied very extensively in terms of Shannon capacity is that is the AWGN channel	test
audio_0_219319.wav	There are many situations where you can actually interpret negative ways in a sensible way	test
audio_0_153304.wav	So, you would find that these expressions are illustrators no human being can speak without introducing some component of body language in one’s communication	test
audio_0_193282.wav	But then I said y is equal to X minus 1	test
audio_0_105358.wav	You can see that like it was in the case of C it is possible to keep on extending adding newer and newer types of employees, but in terms of quiet a bit of cost, in terms of quiet a bit if vulnerability and possible error because I have to manage the type explicitly by myself I have to propagate that properly and I have to every time I add a type my application code has to change	test
audio_0_136058.wav	Now, in their introduction to the Book titled, Francophone Postcolonial Studies, which was published in 2014, the editors Charles Forsdick, and David Murphy, notes this Anglophone bias, and mentions it as the very fact, which has led them, to highlight the French, or Francophone aspects of Postcolonialism	test
audio_0_52723.wav	on right side the charge is going to be q, again with the minus sign, x not divided by d	test
audio_0_176214.wav	That is I am following something and am I getting to, am I reaching the milestones as originally asked	test
audio_0_68322.wav	this is, i believe, the easiest way because these hearts are very fragile, very, very easy to work with you	test
audio_0_102722.wav	You try static cast you get an error; even you try you get desperate, and even try C style casting, you get an error	test
audio_0_61691.wav	this creates that condition that if your probability towards the initial part of iteration is larger, but as t increases the probability will be a smaller, this condition takes care of that	test
audio_0_181455.wav	But the simple voice communication systems actually do not need and do not have a duplex filter, because GSM has allowed you to incorporate a TDD element into the design; I think it is a very clever way of avoiding a bulky component	test
audio_0_203888.wav	For that purpose, what I am going to do	test
audio_0_36928.wav	So, it cancels off right	test
audio_0_30338.wav	So, their attention is not a monolith which goes on like a platform	test
audio_0_184120.wav	This is an FDD system, so there is one link through which the cell phone tower talks to the mobile, and then there is a second link on which the mobile talks to the cell phone	test
audio_0_172541.wav	That means alignment between instruction and assessment and course outcomes that is what it means	test
audio_0_105524.wav	Now, you may wonder as to, am I setting up separate member function to do that	test
audio_0_159767.wav	So, what are the causes of failure	test
audio_0_64644.wav	so we illustrate the problem of partitioning with respect to this gate level netlist that we are seeing here	test
audio_0_58741.wav	so when we say timing budgets here they include target delays along, i means either an entire path or along shorter segment of the paths, which are the nets	test
audio_0_171502.wav	So, basically when the the scientists like Volta and Galvani developed the concept of getting electricity generated from the chemical processes; the fundamentals of electricity came into the picture	test
audio_0_181510.wav	So, this is all about the 2G bands	test
audio_0_99708.wav	A set has a list of items a class T	test
audio_0_61517.wav	so for this, sometimes i imagine my light to be here so that shadow will be propagated along this direction	test
audio_0_5698.wav	So, this is the 35 figure, you have to find out v 1 your v 2 here, I have asking v 1, v 2, v 3 and I, v 3, v 2 is here	test
audio_0_203006.wav	This bearing might be initially turned in that direction	test
audio_0_77180.wav	I can have this particular function A bar fitted to this expression where, I can find out two time constants; tau 1 and tau 2 is	test
audio_0_111898.wav	So, what is V 1 minus what is getting reflected, suppose this V 1 plus is coming, now due to the impedance seeing, some of these may directly come back also whatever V 2 plus is coming some of that come here	test
audio_0_191310.wav	Finally, what is nilpotent	test
audio_0_162573.wav	Now, antenna it is a passive device it does not create its own noise, but it is a receiver of noise because it receives noise, because it is an open it is opening its door	test
audio_0_32492.wav	So, what we will do is we will use the CEM theory to find out what the current is and what will of course, help us is boundary conditions ok, that is the one thing that always fixes things in nature right boundary conditions will force	test
audio_0_150432.wav	13 percent compared to, much lower rates previously reported for email spam	test
audio_0_217810.wav	so, really, ah, you can take and manipulated the way you like	test
audio_0_157369.wav	, what we are trying to do is something called an overflow resolution mechanism	test
audio_0_199108.wav	This terminal has to be ground	test
audio_0_73943.wav	There are various types of muscular dystrophies one of which is all of which involve perturbation of one or more components of this network	test
audio_0_202367.wav	So, now we have finished all the mates available in mechanical mates, we have also covered this advanced and standard mates in previous lectures	test
audio_0_66260.wav	curare can block the neuromuscular junction in a very unique way	test
audio_0_205352.wav	This is the way we project these solids in the next class we will look at more examples on this projection of solids	test
audio_0_100846.wav	So, these are more for you self study than the discussions here	test
audio_0_105080.wav	So, it says that if I write any function and if I have one parameter, two parameter, three parameter, and if some parameter is defaulted then all parameters that I write after this default parameter all of them once this is the defaulted the next one has to be defaulted the next one will also have to be defaulted all of them till the end we will have to be defaulted	test
audio_0_165276.wav	Now let us talk about the source free parallel RLC circuit, so what will happen in this case you will have RL and C all this component in parallel, so what you need to do, you have to first figure out what is the initial condition, so let us assume that initial current flowing through the inductor is I naughtand initial capacitor voltage is V naught, so what you can write I at time is equal to 0 is nothing but I naughtand you can represent it like the integration of V at time t into dt where integration ranges between minus infinity to 0 because this is the time where the system is at rest initially, so what is the current flowing at time is equal to 0 will continue to flow in the circuit at time before t equal to 0, similarly for time t is equal to 0 we are assuming that capacitor is initially charged with voltage V naught	test
audio_0_210718.wav	Let us take a right circular cone; right circular cone, if we are dropping from apex a line, it makes perpendicular line to the base	test
audio_0_199168.wav	First of all, why did we have this RG	test
audio_0_63050.wav	these are four full adders and each of the full adder can be implemented by a carry module and a sum module	test
audio_0_121491.wav	One parent is very indulgent while the other parent is totally the opposite and the story doesn't give us any glimpse of a cozy domestic atmosphere where the three of the family members come together and exchange intermessies	test
audio_0_176342.wav	That is another type of activity and then what you call a tribute or deconstruct	test
audio_0_60928.wav	the idea is very simple	test
audio_0_165513.wav	So in that case, the as long as there is at least one uncontrollable state the system is said to be not completely controllable or we just call it as uncontrollable	test
audio_0_81246.wav	You now want to measure here, then what will I have	test
audio_0_101792.wav	If you do that then this declaration of i is local to this for loop that is once you come out of the for loop you are in the subsequent cout statement or later on i will not be considered to have been declared	test
audio_0_43902.wav	What I have got as a at the end of this calculation what have I got used	test
audio_0_228290.wav	This is a locking nut on this side, locking stray on the other side	test
audio_0_160983.wav	Once it gets also the lock for item B, it will then attain what is called the lock point	test
audio_0_144362.wav	Let us say in year 1 2, it's 5,000, 3,000, it's 7,000 and 6 7 it is 3,000	test
audio_0_165183.wav	So, if you take B as a reference node then it is potential can be at 0 degree, so at 0 volt and voltage V AB is nothing but simply voltage at node A	test
audio_0_41169.wav	I ended up with the differential equation right	test
audio_0_204784.wav	So, axis pass through that passing perpendicular to this plane	test
audio_0_109138.wav	While the focus of the Berne convention was rights of the authors the people who created the work, the Rome convention pertain to neighbouring rights; neighbouring rights meaning the rights of those other than the authors say the performer’s rights	test
audio_0_115608.wav	the integrity, because, as you have seen, integrity ah that ah during the message transfer the data is being altered	test
audio_0_25920.wav	Using a try and except block, we can check the type of error and take appropriate action based on the type	test
audio_0_50054.wav	take it, i is moving around i direction and whereas and the current is changing means the current is given as i as a function of t is equals to i naught plus alpha s t	test
audio_0_94012.wav	let me give you a very small example before we come on to define and discuss what is positive thinking	test
audio_0_201731.wav	Similarly, this portion have a curve comes in that direction	test
audio_0_220480.wav	So, you do not have worry about it, but in this discussion we just leave it out	test
audio_0_28180.wav	This is useful because now you can define local functions which we may want to perform one specialized task which are relevant to f, but it should not be a function which is exposed to everybody else and this is a possibility	test
audio_0_130135.wav	and what jules verne thought about, ah, when he wrote about this, we dont know	test
audio_0_13644.wav	So, one way one one thing is that polar form, I mean first thing is the polar form if you write v is equal to V angle theta	test
audio_0_178924.wav	So, basically that would be my design approach	test
audio_0_232123.wav	So, with this thought, let me conclude and just apart from the book of Saumya Sharma, the recent one it’s just one eighty rupees, available through Amazon, Flipkart so and your local bookseller also, Common Errors in English, that is published just this year, there is a slightly old book published in 1998	test
audio_0_137895.wav	So if you want to create back and forth motion then we have to continuously change the direction of flow automatically	test
audio_0_151655.wav	And it is also not encoded in Unicode	test
audio_0_149985.wav	So, I probably from Delhi I go to Agra, and then I do it check in all Mathura, I do check in Mathura, I do a tip or a done, that is what is actually capturing within 150 kilometers	test
audio_0_190455.wav	So, let us look at the following set: a plus ib, where a and b are integers	test
audio_0_50713.wav	the solenoid carries a current i, so it carries a current i and has n turns	test
audio_0_195142.wav	And if you rearrange these things, you can also see that VGD has to be less than VT	test
audio_0_113658.wav	Now in terms of total thing we could not have done that, total voltage, total current does not give us that inside picture, but the S parameter which is how the wave is flowing that gives us that intricate picture	test
audio_0_136358.wav	So, when we discuss the Indian perspective on decolonisation, we therefore will be actually discussing the perspective as presented through the nationalist discourse of anti colonialism generated by the middle class	test
audio_0_176743.wav	That will be the expected learning outcomes of the next unit	test
audio_0_77417.wav	So, in essential ECM network has some aspect of solid and some aspect of fluid and they are hence called, so, ECM networks are generally viscoelastic	test
audio_0_191880.wav	So, in this example that we did before we proving this preposition, this particular integer rational polynomial is contained c 1 by 12 and f 0 is the primitive polynomial	test
audio_0_26165.wav	The shortest suffix that can be incremented consists of something followed by the longest suffix cannot be incremented	test
audio_0_212002.wav	this is a clear indicator that they are not connected physically	test
audio_0_91652.wav	And now these are the references we have used for preparing this lecture	test
audio_0_122124.wav	And reading pleasure is heightened through such a narrative device	test
audio_0_40289.wav	So, its integration over a volume of the divergence of something; divergence of something being integrated we just saw by which theorem	test
audio_0_142366.wav	12 to 17	test
audio_0_82474.wav	Now, I had to see how the rate of change of current or the current change occurs in the enhancement type MOSFET	test
audio_0_5566.wav	And we are moving in this direction this is i 2 and here i 1 is there, so in upward direction is i 2 minus i 1 so plus 10 i 2 minus i 1 is equal to 0 right	test
audio_0_79333.wav	And so, in this disease you have build up of plaques which limit blood flow through the arteries and eventually might manifested itself as a heart attack and flow is completely stopped	test
audio_0_120220.wav	So, there is a lot of interesting metaphors that has been employed in this particular extract	test
audio_0_198872.wav	And fortunately you can do that because the R1 and R2 forms a voltage divider for this supply and it supplies the gate of the transistor	test
audio_0_231980.wav	15 and 16 the choice given to you was between personal and personnel, again slight difference only	test
audio_0_207521.wav	We have been working on this part section	test
audio_0_84489.wav	I took your first lecture and I told you what is within the IC, but, but you if you if I ask you, how you can fabricate the IC, I am sure now because of the because of the lectures that you have been looking at, you are able to understand how MOSFET is fabricated	test
audio_0_193220.wav	So, I hope the proof is clear, if not you should just the it is fairly similar to the previous videos	test
audio_0_208047.wav	Now, we have to locate foci which is at 35 mm on either side	test
audio_0_203986.wav	Here again, we have two little windows	test
audio_0_180849.wav	So, which means at even though you are close to your base station you may actually get affected by the fact that there is a interferer who’s at a much stronger level	test
audio_0_191891.wav	If c is in Z f 0 also in Z X, so f is in Z X; this now completes the proof	test
audio_0_178130.wav	Of course, this able to achieve this because of the error correcting code I am sure you have studied forward error correction right and your studied reed Solomon codes very very powerful codes, but the interesting thing is when pioneer 10 was launched reed Solomon codes were not yet invented	test
audio_0_142305.wav	You get fund from operations, then adjust for working capital items	test
audio_0_17149.wav	So, this is actually ah one current source is here, a 4 ampere current source is here, another one ampere current source is here and rest all the resistive circuit and this is your reference node potential is 0	test
audio_0_179345.wav	So, this is the non line of sight component basically now you have a line of sight component and a non line of sight component and this is what covers the line of sight component notice that m1 and m2 are non 0 values and therefore, there will be some contribution due to this in the case of the Ricean distribution	test
audio_0_225804.wav	So, let us see whether this intimation can be made formal	test
audio_0_6449.wav	Because this course is mainly for problems right and you have to you have to give you have to try different type of problems and understanding is starting from the basic concept, you try to see how things are right	test
audio_0_39711.wav	So, he is saying go around the structure and find out where the nodes are that is a very crude way is there a smarter way	test
audio_0_138550.wav	Now when you are trying to measure the temperature industrially you do not put those two pieces of wire directly into the fire	test
audio_0_36423.wav	So for example, this equation; so, k k i in general will have a xyz component, this interface is happening at z equal to 0, so k dot r will only have a kx x	test
audio_0_156556.wav	Now, there are certain rules of what can constitute a schedule	test
audio_0_182932.wav	But at the underlying it, what have you done what you have done	test
audio_0_139875.wav	So, that brings us to the end of the lesson 28, thank you very much	test
audio_0_179102.wav	So, here is what the model is going to do	test
audio_0_99754.wav	The name certainly refers to the fact that this function uses quick sort as the underlying sorting algorithm	test
audio_0_240168.wav	We cannot decide, what we need to get to where we want to be	test
audio_0_17815.wav	So, by using equation 1	test
audio_0_27794.wav	So, one by one the maximum value, second maximum value and so on will get into the same list or array in which we are storing the heap and eventually the heap will come out in ascending order	test
audio_0_147503.wav	30 and 6 pm	test
audio_0_163664.wav	So, if we say this then we can say that the loop may be treated as a point source	test
audio_0_102843.wav	They could be other run time errors like arithmetic overflow underflow try to add two numbers and that overflows the number it could be out of range for this	test
audio_0_35247.wav	Since there are n segments each segment has one centre y 1, y 2 all the way up to y n right	test
audio_0_215359.wav	okay, standby mode	test
audio_0_229975.wav	So, then this signal I wanted to connect it one Oscilloscope CRO and see the displacement to see that the data presentation which is happening in a CRO	test
audio_0_193077.wav	It is not difficult to now show that, now prove the Eisenstein criterion	test
audio_0_12871.wav	So, as it is open circuit, so V infinity is the final value will be just 60 volt, because this 60 volt is applied across, this and switch was closed at this position for long time that means this is open right, so V infinity will be 60 volt	test
audio_0_8309.wav	So, if that current I 0 is 0 suppose if initial current is 0, then we can write i t is equal to 0 for t less than 0	test
audio_0_209768.wav	From K point, pick another arbitrary point P such that AP is smaller than PK; so something like this is greater distance	test
audio_0_47325.wav	So you include this and now you simulate and see what are the effects on the various waveforms	test
audio_0_100416.wav	Now, here what do I have on the right hand side	test
audio_0_144654.wav	Then we went to some conceptual discussion	test
audio_0_24233.wav	This looks like a rope	test
audio_0_51548.wav	so what we are seeing is i have a surface on which the laser beam which is coming, let's, absorbed completely	test
audio_0_74346.wav	So, what you backtrack	test
audio_0_51823.wav	but notice that because i am going along the counter, along counter clockwise the path	test
audio_0_96670.wav	rather, you could say: we appreciate a detailed report	test
audio_0_184344.wav	So, which means that you know you will consume a little bit more power the latency reduces a little bit, but and then there is a class C which the receiver says you can talk to me anytime I will be awake I will wake up and communicate	test
audio_0_142132.wav	If court gives decision in our favor, we may not have to pay	test
audio_0_32901.wav	2D integral right, so this is going to be an integral over S d s , what kind of S should it be	test
audio_0_216058.wav	ok, a p i for a programmer	test
audio_0_42755.wav	Yeah you just have to take the z component of it and in your column vector over here this guy, put in the values because, that is the extra incident extra electric field that is coming over here, in addition to the scattered field due to induced current those are the two fields which are present in the conductor which should together sum to 0 ok	test
audio_0_185340.wav	Now, let me quickly do the next step of or maybe we can write it down here N naught minus, N naught minus summation n is equal 1 through N naught cosine to beta basically it will be 1 minus cosine 2 beta n cosine 2 beta n and then the outside term is sign square alpha	test
audio_0_25102.wav	Since we have already considered the fact that how a school student is going to take down notes, now let us get into the next activity of a student life which is preparing or going back to he is notes at home or studying at home, right	test
audio_0_46208.wav	Now you don't need to have generated the net file	test
audio_0_239932.wav	So that, the need for training is sustained	test
audio_0_235380.wav	So, organizations are investing, in career planning and management, of their employees	test
audio_0_24980.wav	You can see the Methaniance sitting there in an egg like structure with their long arms, their physique is different	test
audio_0_216411.wav	ah, the application thinks that you have entered somewhere	test
audio_0_65364.wav	now, one thing: we can obviously see that the space that is there in between two consecutive rows this is naturally a channel	test
audio_0_228251.wav	First circle another we can this x circle is generated here	test
audio_0_161373.wav	So it doesn't matter what is the time spent in the main memory, but the point is to optimize on the number of blocks that is read or written by the algorithm, so number of blocks that is accessed	test
audio_0_218089.wav	ok, this is a gate, this is obviously the source and there is a drain, because i have taken a ah n channel mosfet for, just for you know, keeping things consistent across all our discussions	test
audio_0_105922.wav	In India currently we find that various regulators like the UGC, AICTE and some ranking frameworks like the NIRF	test
audio_0_150422.wav	The problem with that comes with the spam is that it is not only high in these social networks, but there are actually they also stay for longer	test
audio_0_58464.wav	so the value of a is getting propagated, right	test
audio_0_27224.wav	You can actually do this in a more compact way, you can get do away with the name contents and just read directly every line return by the function fh dot readlines	test
audio_0_197272.wav	Let's see how to analyze this	test
audio_0_172515.wav	So you have to do it for 2 hours or 4 hours	test
audio_0_102089.wav	All base class objects will have to be constructed, because all base class objects will become part of the derived class object	test
audio_0_171284.wav	So in this case the balanced delta connected load having an impedance of 20 minus J 15 Ohm is connected to a delta connected positive sequence generator having Vab equal to 330 angle 0 degree volt	test
audio_0_113849.wav	In these lecture, we will see properties of scattering parameters the second tool that we have introduced	test
audio_0_52852.wav	if i come to this surface and make this again, this particular box of very vanishing height but area a, notice that on the inner surface the n is going out and therefore m dot d s from this is going to be the component of m perpendicular to the surface, which is m cosine of phi	test
audio_0_56950.wav	i have, lets say, one point here and one point here	test
audio_0_6433.wav	4 ampere and i y is minus 3	test
audio_0_220136.wav	So, supposing I had set k and an element s in it and I had another set k prime, then I decide to merge these into two single set	test
audio_0_227113.wav	99, well, this wire when it was purchased, it is purchased in the dimension 4 mm	test
audio_0_27929.wav	In this way if we have only these functions to access the thing then we have only conceptual values inside and these conceptual values are manipulated through these functions and we do not know the actual representation	test
audio_0_198669.wav	Now one extremely important thing to keep in mind is that when you do sinusoidal steady state analysis with multiple sources, all sources have to be at the same frequency	test
audio_0_105573.wav	That, if we now place that design of the landline phone class and the mobile phone class and look at them side by side then we see that there are several data member which have basically common, but there are others which are new	test
audio_0_225157.wav	So, I have to look at this configuration to see whether what I move the 12 into violates heap property or not and here again you can see that there is a problem because 12 is still bigger than its parent	test
audio_0_191583.wav	Because remember that is what we need for a vector space	test
audio_0_113805.wav	So, here we have tried to find out to see all the mathematical details are explained in the thing	test
audio_0_122055.wav	Because that is the reading pleasure, that is the satisfaction that we get out of reading fiction	test
audio_0_87552.wav	The 8 addresses should be designed in such a way or should be crafted in such a way such that each of them feels a particular way in a cache corresponding to that set	test
audio_0_124091.wav	ok, and let me say that the initial condition just before the first step is applied at zero minus, is zero	test
audio_0_184104.wav	So, the brilliant observation was this designing these codes of different lengths that have still preserve orthogonality is not a problem, I can do that by using this Walsh Hadamard codes I just have to make sure that I do not assigned parent and child I just have to make sure that if I assign 1 here I have to take the other codes from other parents	test
audio_0_150380.wav	And of course, high in degree which I think when mentioned the part Pagerank, I said, high in degree which has number of followers seen as a matter of influence on	test
audio_0_179358.wav	There is a Bessel function that comes in I naught times s where s is equal to s squared is equal to m1 squared m1 what I will say yeah m1 squared plus m2 squared I hope I wrote this is squared yeah s squared is equal to m1	test
audio_0_189353.wav	If you recall from the scatter plot, we saw there was a high correlation between food and service	test
audio_0_61559.wav	you can compact, ok, but the drawback is that it does not produce, ah, very compact layout as compared to constraint graph method, for example, because you are constraint	test
audio_0_60065.wav	we were basically representing the layout surface of the two dimensional array, where each element of the array represented as cell and we were labeling the cell and carrying out some kind of a search so that from source we reach the target right	test
audio_0_1596.wav	This can be deduced by Lenz’s law which states that the direction of an induced emf such as to oppose the change causing it which is of course, the applied voltage right	test
audio_0_46527.wav	But it is not just that	test
audio_0_222947.wav	So, now that we have that two rotations, then what does rebalancing say, rebalancing says that if I have node which has plus 2, then I will expose its left child and I will check it slope, if it is slope is minus 1 then first I will do a left rotation there and then regardless I will do a right rotation at the top	test
audio_0_31215.wav	So, f of r prime goes in because the operator only acts on the unprimed coordinates right	test
audio_0_235161.wav	There could be unsettling changes	test
audio_0_143767.wav	The number of employees are pretty high in terms of thousands, so it is 23,000 employees and now it is 187,000 employees	test
audio_0_76126.wav	So, if I were to draw this curve again between force and area FA area the nature of the curves remains the same	test
audio_0_50875.wav	if i bring an extra electron now, so the work done, bringing that extra electron is going to be v times e, which is going to b one over four pi, epsilon zero, n, e square over r	test
audio_0_162058.wav	Now obviously, seven element is small that is why rectangular is a like this	test
audio_0_182054.wav	So, which means that the amount of time for which you get to you get to do the channel inversion is very less and therefore, the channel equalization or the channel inversion is actually a quite a quite a difficult task for us to do in practice because the channel is constantly changing how do you keep inverting it and make him because	test
audio_0_165870.wav	Let us see what are those four circuits	test
audio_0_148089.wav	So, this is definitely not the real nptel page	test
audio_0_181374.wav	So, this is called the all call query	test
audio_0_40086.wav	So, it is like this that the string has now become bent due to the application of this force ok	test
audio_0_114156.wav	It processes and displays, now source of network analyzer it either a phase locked VCO; voltage control oscillator or a synthesized source synthesized source means the source at a particular frequency then from that various into 2 divide by 2 etcetera	test
audio_0_204087.wav	So, now, we will check this linear coupler	test
audio_0_189604.wav	Now, we are taking another data frame which contains 3 names Senthil Ramesh and Sam and the other column carries the department, where they are working	test
audio_0_203674.wav	Now, this surface is visible this surface is visible and this line is also visible, the surface whatever it is connecting; so, this one whereas, these lines are invisible	test
audio_0_32051.wav	What you call supporting	test
audio_0_71701.wav	So, these products somewhere lie in between organic and embedded	test
audio_0_188333.wav	Once I do this you can see that the console will get cleared remember clearing console will not delete the variables that are there in the workspace you can see that even though we have cleared the console in the workspace we still have the variables that are created earlier	test
audio_0_36384.wav	Now so, we will deal with plane waves ok; so now, when you looked at this kind of a problem I mean this is something that we have been seeing from high school, plane a planar interface and a wave falling over there that is when we have derived the Fresnel reflection coefficients for two different polarizations	test
audio_0_223291.wav	So, you have a slot which starts at s i and finishes at f i, now two instructors may have over lapping slot	test
audio_0_178026.wav	8 kilometers	test
audio_0_113847.wav	Now, in the next lectures we will see that how to design networks which achieves this conjugate matching	test
audio_0_29566.wav	And when my child is imitating me either my wife or say my mother or others in the adults in the family they say	test
audio_0_64658.wav	so you can see that the delay can be of the order of the magnitude higher as we go, for you can say intra chip routing to intra boards and across boards	test
audio_0_234874.wav	You do, whatever you need to do	test
audio_0_163547.wav	Now with proper, so what are the design parameters	test
audio_0_20898.wav	So you assume that this is the first budget	test
audio_0_219587.wav	Now, this is something that we intuitively do all the time, this is how we look for say words in a dictionary or when we play 20 questions, we try to ask questions about the age of a person, then you say is this person less than 40, is this person greater than 65 and so on	test
audio_0_232517.wav	But they are very essential for our happy, healthy and harmonious living if only we do not make them commercialized highly and then if you are able to use them in the free and natural forms	test
audio_0_234867.wav	We may institute, wellness pay programs	test
audio_0_144282.wav	Now gaps and accounting standards as considered as a theory base for all the accounting	test
audio_0_24940.wav	So, he asked the students to imagine a planet, fourth planet from the Sun, the Arcturus, not the sun, Arcturus	test
audio_0_84714.wav	Because in negative photoresist, whatever area is not exposed will be weaker in positive photoresist	test
audio_0_135135.wav	So we have to again press the green button from this response panel, we will do this	test
audio_0_235402.wav	Which is the first priority for any employee	test
audio_0_232152.wav	Now first one, Meet Madhav	test
audio_0_207552.wav	You can import it like this, and then again insert component in browse and other items that we intend to include	test
audio_0_146565.wav	Newspapers at that time, they reported that the Mars Pathfinder is experiencing failures	test
audio_0_31716.wav	So, this is this dirac delta function is a function in those many dimensions	test
audio_0_71753.wav	That when the product size increases in what, in which proportion the development time does not increase in that way	test
audio_0_223118.wav	I will split a, b as a and b, I will get this tree, then the previous step was to combine c, d e into c and d, e	test
audio_0_121165.wav	For them the world has shrunk to this particular chess board and nothing else matters except the game of chess	test
audio_0_123144.wav	how do find that	test
audio_0_145583.wav	Third task needs three units of execution every 20 units of time	test
audio_0_84486.wav	At the the same time, we will see lot of things which are really advanced right	test
audio_0_92782.wav	So, if we conclude the partial derivative of F 1 with respect to y then so, the first term will here with respect to y we will get minus e power x sine y and plus z	test
audio_0_39172.wav	It is called a Volterra integral equation which is almost identical to a Fredholm integral equation, can you spot the difference	test
audio_0_121586.wav	And I'll try to show you how an analysis of plot tells the reader something more about the various motivations and several characters in this story	test
audio_0_35497.wav	So, I do I how do I break into triangles what is the tool that I need for that	test
audio_0_108569.wav	Similarly, when we see an author writing a book, what we see him do is putting the pen on paper, and you seem laboriously doing that days and days together till is book is done	test
audio_0_33630.wav	So, we continue our discussion of edge based or vector 2D Finite Element Method and what we have seen so far is the most natural way of formulating the problem, unknown in terms of the total field right	test
audio_0_89124.wav	Now if the time taken is greater than some particular threshold in this case T0, then it is assumed that the response is obtained from malicious device or from an attacker device and is ignored and no authentication is done	test
audio_0_153614.wav	Proxemics is divided into four different zones of intimacy level	test
audio_0_80244.wav	So, this is the, this is a pipicturec that you are looking at, this amplitude you are looking at	test
audio_0_40929.wav	Yeah, I have made it into lumped components, but I do not know the value of the lump parameters what should I put for the value of Ra and Xa	test
audio_0_236045.wav	At the same time, civil society organizations, have a responsibility, have, are, accountable to their clients, to deliver the mission, that they exist, for	test
audio_0_152094.wav	I strongly recommend you to ask, check the forum before posting the questions	test
audio_0_104619.wav	So, it basically internally take looks at this, checks the corresponding, what is the virtual function pointer table of that object	test
audio_0_178232.wav	And the today’s lecture will pull those things together	test
audio_0_133629.wav	So, how truthful are you, that would be know the basically interpretation of these Metaneeds and while you are trying to maintain certain degree of truthness in you, you ensure that you are not going to be dishonest likewise now the lower level needs that is now the d needs which are more of physiological oriented and safety oriented needs	test
audio_0_178348.wav	So, what it says is this is the time duration over which I can expect to see worst case correlation anywhere between 1 maximum correlation to correlation of 0	test
audio_0_190842.wav	So, this is equal to this, but I n is also contained in I right because I n is one of the factors whose union is I	test
audio_0_208446.wav	So, as I am going beginning from 0 degrees increases to 10, 20, 30 and so on 360 degrees, gradually the radius also increases	test
audio_0_196362.wav	And you can see that although this RG is will be very large, this GMRL is also a large number because it is the gain, so the input resistance will be substantially smaller than RG in this case	test
audio_0_132202.wav	f is a number and ah it is of course like this: in counter flow arrangement we get maximum amount of heat transfer that is most conducive for maximum heat exchange between two streams	test
audio_0_187043.wav	So, this particular hypothesis test can be also reinterpreted as the null hypothesis implies beta 1 equal to 0 which means what we are doing is only a t of y i is equal to a constant whereas, if we accept in or reject the null hypothesis then we are actually fitting a linear model with beta naught and beta 1 present	test
audio_0_12542.wav	In this case there is no current flowing through this 4 ohm resistance is 0	test
audio_0_135964.wav	But the reason that Okonkwo murders Ikemefuna is that, as I have already told you, he constantly is haunted by the fear that others might think that he is weak	test
audio_0_40811.wav	So, all the hard work goes into finding out g, a lot of hard work will go into finding out g that is solving equation 2	test
audio_0_29228.wav	So I have a blank space, a blank space and a 4, because I was told to put 4 in a width of 3 and think of it as a number, so since its number it goes to right hand	test
audio_0_19360.wav	In monetary terms, it is 5 into 2 10 lakhs plus maybe some other expenses of 2 lakhs, so 12 lakhs	test
audio_0_181820.wav	Because is no fading there is no need for diversity, basically all you can get is the array gain and this is primarily in fading environments	test
audio_0_130276.wav	i talked about the hindenburg incident, where this air ships, which are hydrogen powered, ah the jet plane, which was the last air ship, crashed in nineteen thirty seven	test
audio_0_10164.wav	1 that is that means, percentage impedance actually given 0	test
audio_0_168236.wav	network as shown in the figure below and now the objective is to determine the mesh current I 1 and I 2 and the current flowing in the capacitor and active power delivered by 100 voltage with reference phasor as 0	test
audio_0_29925.wav	And from that there is a behavior which will again give a feedback, which will again determine how the whole thing is going to be recycled or cycled	test
audio_0_84269.wav	You can change the to whether it is a high level, or you can change it to low level, again if you want to change it you can see	test
audio_0_202432.wav	If there are anything like tapered features for example, here, we have a tapered feature instead of having a rectangle perhaps the object might be having such kind of feature	test
audio_0_135458.wav	And to get an idea about how big this change was, let us look at these two maps	test
audio_0_46447.wav	When the BJT is on, this diode is off the voltage across that is VIN	test
audio_0_135435.wav	And this becomes evident if you try and read the novel contrapuntally	test
audio_0_94768.wav	be specific, ah, while making or while describing list amounts or figures, whatever is applicable in your organizations	test
audio_0_149949.wav	So, if you see earlier, we saw that the there is high correlation between mayorship, tips and dones	test
audio_0_163090.wav	So, since this is done electronically, it is also called electronic scanning	test
audio_0_78135.wav	So I will stop here for today and we will continue the from here in the next class	test
audio_0_70139.wav	Laminar flow hood is essentially rectangular or circular structure which where the airs	test
audio_0_224912.wav	So, for example if you look at these values which have left sub trees, so for 5 we go down the left sub tree and we find the right most value which is 4	test
audio_0_163054.wav	The obviously, with experience you will rectify those mistakes that you commit in your earlier things, but this will I hope will give you a good starting point for your antenna design or analysis career	test
audio_0_213838.wav	so p	test
audio_0_32955.wav	So, del G by del r that is what I have to do ok	test
audio_0_60754.wav	so they will become like this, like this: similarly, you apply a horizontal cut on the top to divide these four rectangles and a horizontal cut on the bottom to divide these four rectangles, so finally you arrive at sixteen rectangles where each rectangle contains only one gate or one node	test
audio_0_59553.wav	lets try to just work out	test
audio_0_155278.wav	Sometimes it may generate confusions among people in cross cultural situations	test
audio_0_145807.wav	And this R is actually a shared non preemptible resource	test
audio_0_173116.wav	Explore and select a method of solving a formulated problem	test
audio_0_94096.wav	but then, in order to have a proper interaction, in order to have a proper and satisfactory association as well as a satisfactory transaction, you will come across people with different tastes and habits, as i said, and you have to work in a team, and the team members are often different	test
audio_0_224988.wav	So, it will not come back to this case it will just stop at the earlier two cases and it will get successfully deleted	test
audio_0_52542.wav	recall what did we write there	test
audio_0_185715.wav	So, that is an other important difference between k nearest neighbor and logistic regression for example	test
audio_0_102196.wav	So, here we are just assigning some values to the different array elements and printing them, only difference is in terms the using the printf or using the cout	test
audio_0_112200.wav	Now, the impedance matching network is either adding either an R or L or C any of them a single one	test
audio_0_34519.wav	But I do not know the electric field is sitting in there which is itself an object of computation I do not know the electric field	test
audio_0_239034.wav	So, retention or termination of individual employees	test
audio_0_56387.wav	this much time the data must be stable	test
audio_0_176569.wav	I gave that as an example to say different educationists may use these words to mean something very specific	test
audio_0_191879.wav	So, this shows that the expression of any arbitrary rational polynomial into its content times a primitive polynomial is unique, ok	test
audio_0_35105.wav	Gauss quadrature Gaussian Gauss Legendre any quadrature rule	test
audio_0_183788.wav	So, at 0 lag you get 1 at all other lags you get some small number minus 1 over Q	test
audio_0_206832.wav	So, now, we have points ABCD and this is the first isometric view because we are observing it from right hand vertical face	test
audio_0_205478.wav	So, we do not really require to show this hatching thing	test
audio_0_219067.wav	So, they cannot be any edges with in U, therefore, U is an independence set	test
audio_0_104071.wav	At a later module we would like to take up the phones and actually do a complete design of the inheritance structure but now, let me move on to the concrete semantics of what the C++ inheritance would mean	test
audio_0_125330.wav	so just by looking at this analysis, it looks like regardless of in which way u have op amp input signs, the circuit will work in the same way	test
audio_0_193661.wav	So, this is short form is gcd that you all are familiar from high school, right we know about gcd, LCM and so on	test
audio_0_161716.wav	So it removes the named data item, whatever the data item from the young one, it makes it release it and it preemptively grabs the data item even though the old was holding it	test
audio_0_159682.wav	So it doesn't matter which order they read	test
audio_0_236077.wav	They may have a lack of resources	test
audio_0_102178.wav	So, if I have just invoked the base 1 constructor and base 2 does not have a default constructor then I will have a compilation error, because to be able to construct a derived class object I need construct both base 1 and base 2 kind of objects	test
audio_0_189069.wav	Now ultimately what I want to point out is the following now we have an answer for why there are so many methods	test
audio_0_159203.wav	And how does one remedy	test
audio_0_202300.wav	And we will make let us just make a copy of this	test
audio_0_28399.wav	If you have base 16, if you have studied base 16 ever in school, you would know that, you have the digit zero to 9, but base 16 has numbers up to 15	test
audio_0_68776.wav	So, cell lines are cells which are continuously dividing and people isolate such colonies of cell and store it in liquid nitrogen and take them out and again culture them again subculture them we will come to these words do not worry about it what is culturing what is sub culturing and all those things	test
audio_0_66916.wav	Now, if you ask me that how all these things are known it is 100 years or last 56 years people are being working	test
audio_0_220244.wav	Then, so we will assume that we have done this of course, we can do this we know in order n log n time right to the beginning	test
audio_0_182768.wav	Again definitely would encourage you to make sure that you do write it down in full	test
audio_0_207486.wav	Now, release your mouse button	test
audio_0_228037.wav	So, same way this backlash also happens if we have in these linkages	test
audio_0_103499.wav	So, to recap, this is the inheritance aspects of inheritance semantics	test
audio_0_58209.wav	you are increasing the actual arrival time by two	test
audio_0_135874.wav	Which means that we are readily able to sympathise with the Africans of the Umuofia village when they can neither make head nor tail of the new religion of Christianity that the white man brings along with him	test
audio_0_95129.wav	it is always better to maintain, it is always better to follow the aida process	test
audio_0_160911.wav	That means all the things that are in the disk buffer etc	test
audio_0_34684.wav	So, ideal world I want F H r is equal to 0 for every r that is the solution of the wave equation not possible	test
audio_0_50690.wav	the charge in this ring of thick width delta r is going to be its area: two pi r, delta r times sigma and per second this charge passes omega over two pi times on the frequency times	test
audio_0_239520.wav	The top HR executive should report, directly to the CEO	test
audio_0_237713.wav	You can choose from this, this, this	test
audio_0_238285.wav	Local offices, often feel, left out of corporate planning	test
audio_0_102479.wav	As you know by now is the const ness turned out to be such an important improvement in the C programming that C language standard actually went forward, and have taken const as a part of C standard back way from C++	test
audio_0_235897.wav	And, the opportunity to work from home, depending on, what is really the driving force	test
audio_0_153397.wav	They have a point of beginning and a point at which they end	test
audio_0_201584.wav	So, if we are drawing a vertical line here and a unit of 2	test
audio_0_68445.wav	you should be able to see the spontaneous beatings right	test
audio_0_71969.wav	You need to plan, it's a large activity	test
audio_0_105462.wav	The landline phones, the typical ones that we had been using maybe 20 years back, 30 years back	test
audio_0_5961.wav	So, now the now next is the next is this is your what you call voltage source, now current flowing through a dependent current source is determined by a current or voltage elsewhere in the circuit for example	test
audio_0_175653.wav	At operative level, we have selected four general categories of knowledge namely Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge and we gave a brief overview of these four categories of knowledge	test
audio_0_65192.wav	so, if you recall, we talked about area or grid routing, where we are able to connect arbitrary two points on a two dimensional grid, like structure in the presence of obstacles	test
audio_0_28724.wav	If I have no letters left, if I have gone i j I am looking at difference combinations i and j	test
audio_0_147990.wav	Now, getting back to the token, we can also see the name of the user who generated this token, which is Tom in this case	test
audio_0_107166.wav	Patents are granted by the national regimes and protected within the boundaries of the national regime	test
audio_0_19403.wav	So, let us start collecting the important data and we know in marginal costing or in CVP, we segregate the costs as for their nature	test
audio_0_54142.wav	this becomes conceptually very important later when we talk about electromagnetic waves, of fields propagating	test
audio_0_80874.wav	So, when the temperature rises to 35 degree this is called the drift, bias current offset current offset voltage change with temperature all right	test
audio_0_66578.wav	ok, so, depending on the force generated by the myotubes, there will be a certain kind of an oscillation which will be happening out here now while this oscillation is taking place	test
audio_0_5538.wav	Because, this is theta Y, similarly at when omega tends to 0 right angle of admittance is minus 90 degree; that means, angle of impedance is plus 90 degree right	test
audio_0_67817.wav	So, one thing which could happen is the Schwann cells will migrate towards the axon and along the axon the Schwann cells may form exactly the way it happens they may slowly divide like this and they may form what I was trying to tell you is something like out here something like this or this may not even ever happen	test
audio_0_147352.wav	So let me show you	test
audio_0_150043.wav	And then use it for finding the difference between what did I say and what I actually have, that is the graph here	test
audio_0_221369.wav	So, if we solve, this is, this general m plus n m plus n choose n, right	test
audio_0_35256.wav	So, I can take all of these guys and put them into a column vector b right and you can see that all of these equations have the variables a 1, a 2, a 3 all the way up to a n in one string right	test
audio_0_151519.wav	005, where the anger is higher is again could be that citizens are actually expressing the views and they really want to get things done and they are approaching the police to actually get things done as quickly as possible	test
audio_0_116986.wav	the cv gives me idea to do that right	test
audio_0_62564.wav	and if you have a bad placement, obviously i have mention it earlier you may not be able to complete the routing	test
audio_0_221592.wav	So, you update every edge again and then you update every edge again, now we know that a shortest path between any two vertices as at most n minus 1 edges	test
audio_0_149632.wav	So, this was the example of a line chart	test
audio_0_219302.wav	So, we have now two contributions to our complexity	test
audio_0_130617.wav	yes, is the conductor moving relative to the magnetic field	test
audio_0_102565.wav	So, having said that I would also like to point out a few features; now what we have not covered is very difficult to list out because C++ is actually so huge that it is very difficult to say what we have not done	test
audio_0_81241.wav	So, once again if I see the definition of an integrator, if I see the definition of an integrator, it is a circuit whose output is proportional to to the negative integral negative integral of the input signal with respect to time	test
audio_0_184140.wav	So, this is something that you would be able to understand in many different ways probably the easiest way is to look at the power of the transmitted signal P s	test
audio_0_195043.wav	And in the incremental picture we need it to be VS, that is the source has to be connected	test
audio_0_59093.wav	so you can easily see that this stick diagram of this layout	test
audio_0_221988.wav	So, what quick sort Tony Hoare algorithms says, do not necessarily pick the medium, just picks some value in A and do what we said	test
audio_0_65025.wav	so you select one module at a time, computes its zero force location and try to place it there	test
audio_0_202871.wav	So, line by line it construct it and fills it by particular kind of colors	test
audio_0_118916.wav	time to read data from disk performing computation, write back to the disk	test
audio_0_84963.wav	It will auto scale it and it will be very easy for you to understand	test

audio_0_227763.wav	So, transfer efficiency like magnification, this is very important in terms of transducers the detecting or the sensing element of the measuring system first makes contact with the quality to be measured and the sensed information is immediately transduced into an analogous form, ok, you are sensing the stage and you are converting the sensed stage into a data are the primary	test
audio_0_103044.wav	You say this is a volatile variable i and you read the same code now it does neither gets optimize, and what you expect is this code will actually work because you being a volatile variable you expect that there is some other agent, there some hardware, some port, some kernel system, some thread possibly is changing its through some other means	test
audio_0_474.wav	For series motor your flux actually professional to I a because in series motor your I a is equal to I f	test
audio_0_91491.wav	The second one if this point z is equal to z naught is a simple pole then how to get this residue	test
audio_0_27217.wav	We might just want to make sure that all writes up to this point have been actually reflected on the disk	test
audio_0_108826.wav	So, the survey tells us that for every 2 million dollars that is spent in research and the search includes setting up labs, paying’s for salaries, for researchers everything the outcome is one formal disclosure and one US patent is filed for every 5 million dollars in research expenditure now this is the data for you to understand that there is an input before IPR comes as an output and one tech transfer or licensing agreement is entered for every 8	test
audio_0_183757.wav	The correlation is between the basic sequence and sequence that is right shifted by one	test
audio_0_231063.wav	This can be in turn link with the distance which I said in the seven basic as meters	test
audio_0_104690.wav	So, we can demonstrate that here	test
audio_0_103494.wav	Since the last module, we have been discussing on inheritance; we have noted that inheritance is a basic mechanism in C++ of modelling, encoding, there is a relationship of object oriented programming, the generalization and specialization relationship	test
audio_0_40898.wav	So, this I can replace like this	test
audio_0_121876.wav	Please note that as I mentioned before, the daughter plays at his feet while the father writes his novels	test
audio_0_55156.wav	so what does this involve	test
audio_0_64302.wav	so longer the line, longer will be the values of rc and, as you know, for any rc kind of a network we refer to as it as rc delay	test
audio_0_101228.wav	So when we use parameters, reference variables in parameters, we call them as call by reference mechanism	test
audio_0_150156.wav	So, let us look at the most common 25 words and we say print token comma count	test
audio_0_185316.wav	So, let us verify the and again it is a very in instructive exercise I will skip some steps, but I would request you to definitely validate them	test
audio_0_200633.wav	And our operating point is over there	test
audio_0_191873.wav	So, leading coefficient of f 0 is positive, leading coefficient of g 0 is positive that means, f 0 is equal to g 0	test

audio_0_70474.wav	Some of the projects might be healthcare related projects	test
audio_0_26632.wav	Similarly, we go to the left of the two sub problems Fibonacci of 3 requires 2 and 1; 2 requires 1 and 0	test
audio_0_205150.wav	So, remaining sides also rotated by the same amount, once that is done this entire pentagon will be turned into that direction, once that is done again project these lines from e, c, a, b and c and already we have rotated into 45 degreesin the vertical plane	test
audio_0_220773.wav	So, when we sort this by marks of course, we need to exchange the position of Bharathi and Ashwin, but we do not want to exchange the position of Aswini and Chander	test
audio_0_107368.wav	When the follow up happens in India using the PCT route, we call it a PCT national phase application	test
audio_0_55202.wav	when contrast the grid routing algorithms which you discussed, they are used, not directly associated with global or detail routing, but whenever we run into some problem, we use are routing because area routing is considered to be one where you can find path between two points which are otherwise not so easy to connect	test
audio_0_182405.wav	Properties : integral 0 to T mod g i of t whole squared d t is equal to 1 is it correct, would you agree, yes	test
audio_0_178585.wav	For co phasing we need only the argument, but you know if once you take Z K conjugate you will get the negative of the angle as well	test
audio_0_134816.wav	So up to 30 seconds maximum of 9 chunks and if you combine them together, then this helps us a lot in terms of arriving at a decision	test
audio_0_150589.wav	So, you can actually look at if you are interested you can actually look at this project called livelihoods	test
audio_0_84725.wav	So, now, I have photoresist which is negative SiO2; silicon, SiO2 after that I will etch; so, after photoresist is developed I will do the hard bake, I will do the hard baking 120 degree centigrade per minute	test
audio_0_213454.wav	let me show you in the code the point where i r q stata is actually: ah, this particular register setting is actually enabled	test

audio_0_97600.wav	And being a global function it has to be able it will be able to access only those members which have public	test
audio_0_136349.wav	Das or M	test
audio_0_99631.wav	If we look at this now using this, assuming that all that goes into the stack dot h the header, then I just instantiate it much like the way we are instantiating the function we just instantiate it say it for the character	test
audio_0_220756.wav	So, the total work done in this loop is going to be order n	test
audio_0_33675.wav	So, finite difference time domain again, we will visit this over here right	test
audio_0_20312.wav	Now, some costs have already been incurred and they cannot be reversed and that's why they play no role in the decision making	test
audio_0_71045.wav	And for this, it has invited bids and the project managers, they visit the company and understand what the company needs	test
audio_0_59101.wav	so this source of one transistor, it is connected to the drain of the other transistor and this channel is formed on the diffusion layer	test
audio_0_39431.wav	And in this case N is 2 so, this is accurate to order 3 my given function over here is a cubic polynomial	test
audio_0_56068.wav	buffers may be inserted into long critical wires	test

audio_0_210180.wav	These are the modules what we will cover in computer graphics	test
audio_0_166447.wav	Generally, we use only the Kirchhoff’s current law because it is more convenient in walking through this circuit and then we obtained the input	test
audio_0_83692.wav	It means that when we take an amplifier and when we insert the amplifier in the circuit; then we can see that the output voltage is proportional to such common mode signal	test
audio_0_76188.wav	So, there are 2 pools of actin or actin exists in 2 forms have F actin and G actin	test
audio_0_101568.wav	So, in summary, we have introduced the static data members and static member function, and we have shown that they can be used for various purposes of counting objects for maintaining any data at the class level and specifically for creating singleton objects	test
audio_0_118828.wav	that means we are increasing the data load number of processor fixed and it will means it will basically approaches one	test
audio_0_160636.wav	Monet DB is an example of a columnar relational database, Munadip	test
audio_0_197069.wav	Similarly the drain, it is only an output	test
audio_0_6369.wav	44 watt this is the p L max right	test
audio_0_9381.wav	So, it is a linear it is it is a linear equation basically right	test
audio_0_213173.wav	so, yes, oh, something went wrong in this simulation here	test
audio_0_58123.wav	delay budgeting concerns that, that some delay values i dynamically calculating in a alterative way and at the end it will give me by how much units i have to increase the delay in certain lines	test
audio_0_99306.wav	So, in this module what we have shown is, if you are programming in C++ then you get a major advantage in terms of using stack	test
audio_0_182957.wav	So, the criteria for choosing a modulation, again we will approach it in a very intuitive way in this lecture and then build the detailed into the next one	test
audio_0_240042.wav	Businesses complain that, schools award degrees	test
audio_0_199928.wav	And you can also include the output conductance of the transistor in saturation region	test
audio_0_152948.wav	Is a esoteric knowledge on the other hand; is no widely known and it is mostly a hidden understanding	test
audio_0_122008.wav	As I climbed the waiting buggy, I thought that we could not manage the Onum festival sales without Ravutha	test
audio_0_217020.wav	you have to look out and actually purchase something that you will get in that range	test
audio_0_35427.wav	In addition to this what equation, I mean what else I needed was the Green’s functions G 1 and some G 2, G 1 was free space	test
audio_0_225806.wav	Well, one of the reasons is just from experience or it is empirical	test
audio_0_187759.wav	This idea is what is called as regularization	test
audio_0_76713.wav	This might be another possibility	test
audio_0_185838.wav	However, if you notice, if I get a test data point and I have to find let us say the 5 closest neighbor, there is no way in which I can do this, it looks like, unless I calculate all the distances	test
audio_0_212431.wav	in any case, further processing of this data is required, which brings a brings us to a very important part of the i o t architecture: storage of the data, either locally or on the cloud	test
audio_0_119992.wav	so these are the	test
audio_0_75724.wav	So, it is obvious that if you have a filament against the wall so, what is the wall in case of a moving cell	test
audio_0_164052.wav	Now, if you are asked to find out the current through the capacitor you have to just simply differentiate the voltage equation which we have got	test

audio_0_83248.wav	What is Vplus	test
audio_0_188362.wav	So, we might not have enough variables to satisfy all the equations	test
audio_0_227441.wav	So, these are certain precautions we can so it can be used to mark lines, vertical lines using the proper vertical lines, ok	test
audio_0_62568.wav	let say i have a block, b, one here	test
audio_0_175346.wav	And then record the attainments in this form	test
audio_0_19502.wav	Concessional fee, the only one answer is there, that is 108	test
audio_0_99963.wav	Coming to the last, when you invoke h in terms of this p B and you try to see it will turn out to be B colon colon h because you certainly look here, you have B type object	test
audio_0_97163.wav	The size of, to find the number of bytes of any variable or type cannot be overloaded; the ternary operator cannot be overloaded and so on	test
audio_0_147708.wav	Now, the size of the labels will be in line with the size of the nodes, because that is how we have sized our nodes	test
audio_0_39255.wav	So, when I put on the integral sign a loop over here like this it means that it is a integral over a closed path starting point initial point is the same and this is going to be zero right	test
audio_0_201312.wav	But it will be valid only for VDS more than VGS minus VT and how much is VGS minus VT now it will be 1 volt okay so this will be the curve for VDS equals 1 volt	test
audio_0_107163.wav	The national regime is nothing, but the domestic patent regime	test
audio_0_77950.wav	But if f is small then probably that wall can be pushed back	test
audio_0_215728.wav	before we go into sessions, let me spend a little more time on persistence time	test
audio_0_104584.wav	And the resultant I keep in p B, which is a B type pointer	test
audio_0_180100.wav	And the trunking efficiency was the Erlang B discussion that we had, again not going into the derivation of the Erlang B, but just use that to, given the number of channels and the blocking probability probability of blocking which is grade of service GoS	test
audio_0_210012.wav	So, if we are rotating that, we get this view	test
audio_0_168283.wav	So, if you want to know that what the power active power being delivered by the source you have to simply find out what the power being absorbed by these two resistances	test
audio_0_55105.wav	ok, so after you have placed ah the cells, you can carry out global placements	test
audio_0_100983.wav	This is a case where the associativity is right	test
audio_0_132417.wav	it can be used as a topping cycle in an st plant, in a steam turbine plant, or as a bottoming cycle in a gas turbine plant	test
audio_0_218179.wav	so you can see that this is indeed one megahertz, right ah, down to eight mega hertz, right, ah, sorry, is it eight ah	test
audio_0_114590.wav	what sort of processes are	test
audio_0_221021.wav	But essentially, the sequential speed of a CPU is stuck at about 10 to the 8 operations per second	test
audio_0_58066.wav	so this notation i am just repeating for your convenience: this i and j indicate two blocks	test
audio_0_104635.wav	It is what is known as it throws a bad cast exception, now we have not yet discussed about exception	test
audio_0_47338.wav	8 volts for many most of the digital circuits so you need to see that a power a power supply, something like a power supply is built which will do this job of properly converting a DC of one level to DC of another level	test
audio_0_91775.wav	So, we have six points 0, 1, 2 and the 4, 5, 6 they are also not equidistant and then corresponding values are given	test
audio_0_120423.wav	And if you, as I mentioned in my previous lectures, the narrator kind of obsesses about meals	test
audio_0_103338.wav	And you cannot create an instance, but the fact that a function is purely virtual says that an implementation for that function is not necessary, but it does not say that I cannot have an implementation	test
audio_0_237809.wav	So then, we talk about, disparate treatment or disparate	test
audio_0_43910.wav	Because there will be shaded this everything in that way	test
audio_0_222481.wav	So, it could incur cost of 114 to the store, this spanning tree	test
audio_0_100185.wav	It does not know how many fields what size it should point to	test
audio_0_6267.wav	And plus your ah plus the right hand side, this i 1, this is also your i 1	test
audio_0_205379.wav	So, when you are slicing it, you always be having some material within those portions; wherever the plane is passing through that we will show it by hatched lines	test
audio_0_25635.wav	This inversion does not mean R going to S or S going to R that may happen if priority changes	test
audio_0_36111.wav	So, the short form for finite element method everywhere you will find is FEM and it is a relatively recent method	test
audio_0_121460.wav	And Minnie replied, the Khabeliwala gave it to me	test
audio_0_185950.wav	So, if you look at this and the one constraint case you will see the similarities	test
audio_0_84301.wav	So, if I put a pin inside the vacuum, what will happen	test
audio_0_173156.wav	The whole bunch of non functional specifications and they will all come from let us say the many times they come from cultural and societal considerations	test
audio_0_201059.wav	This is what you would do if you came across an unfamiliar circuit	test
audio_0_102953.wav	So, if you put that on then this at assert feature would not be there	test
audio_0_41677.wav	Lhopitals rule right	test
audio_0_140428.wav	Then you have filtering, filtering is required for noise removal, as we will see it is also required for a phenomenon called anti aliasing, so and we could do some linearization in the signal conditioner itself or you know, sometimes you can do the linearization as one of the, one of the benefits of digital data acquisition is that you can do that in linearization probably much more easily in software so	test
audio_0_145169.wav	One important variation is called as a minimum laxity first	test
audio_0_181725.wav	So, the advantage is that this is a finite range, finite range 0 to pi by 2, 0 comma pi by 2	test
audio_0_233576.wav	Or, for some reason, they may not feel, , they may not be, in tune with the requirements of the, the changing requirements of the organization, at which point, those attitudes, will also need to be assessed	test
audio_0_188675.wav	However, there is no need to do that because I already found a feasible point here	test
audio_0_164148.wav	Forced response is the value of the current after a long time when the switch is closed	test
audio_0_95942.wav	some people also write, ah, thanks for a letter dated such and such	test
audio_0_138612.wav	So the main, so there are two things done one is variable conversion, second thing is big amount of power amplification is to be done	test
audio_0_41675.wav	So, a log a minus a	test
audio_0_101815.wav	C99 introduced explicit Boolean type and that is given by the name underscore bool, where b is written in capital, but that since that is not a very normal natural way to write bool, it has also provided a new standard library header called std bool dot h, where three macros are provided	test
audio_0_50032.wav	four omega sigma by three, two cos theta r cap plus sine theta theta cap by r cube	test
audio_0_95422.wav	you may work alone because you are qualified enough, but then when we have to achieve a goal, we have to work in a team	test
audio_0_198576.wav	Again, as with the case of the voltage control voltage source, although there is no gain, this is still useful as a current buffer	test
audio_0_77072.wav	So, what is typically done to get around it, but you know that your protein is folding stably as per other experiments	test
audio_0_226287.wav	One is refraction; the other one is going to be diffraction	test
audio_0_109863.wav	So, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is sufficient to get VSWR, that is why we take the magnitude of the reflection coefficient, and that turns to be these ultimately you will see that we some mathematical manipulation it become a some trigonometric relations	test
audio_0_149573.wav	Now since we have to represent the values as date formats, we need to include another inbuilt python package called as datetime	test
audio_0_154726.wav	She has referred to the brand of Kombi which sells a warm winter clothing suitable for the Canadian climate	test
audio_0_158281.wav	So, that is the thing if it is view equivalent to some serial schedule	test
audio_0_45727.wav	So whenever you want to measure a signal here, it should be with respect to some point on the output side	test
audio_0_26617.wav	The Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1 and then you add	test
audio_0_31996.wav	So, remember to stick in the e to the j omega t and that gives you the full time dependent ok	test
audio_0_62455.wav	so these two faults will get added to this list	test
audio_0_19608.wav	Here I have tried to show you the calculation	test
audio_0_169593.wav	So, basically in this particular lecture, we will try to understand the basic concepts which are required to analyze those circuits which are connected with some time wearing sinusoidal voltage or current source	test
audio_0_88892.wav	The ring oscillators PUF is something like this, to actually start the Ring Oscillator PUF the user would have to give an enable signal essentially, essentially change the enable from 0 to 1 and also specify a challenge	test
audio_0_119112.wav	ah, shreya will join, she will	test
audio_0_180538.wav	So, then we say that this is expected value of let me keep consistent with the notation that it is the expected value of a gamma which is a random variable, but that is itself for the constants	test
audio_0_173083.wav	But in all these through the analysis or researching the literature, formulation, you have to be always using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences	test
audio_0_95061.wav	please also stay there, for there may be some questions and you should always be prepared to answer those questions	test
audio_0_67473.wav	so for age related systems you needed something which is age related, matching systems	test
audio_0_67887.wav	Then your requirements will be kind of different, similarly if it is a tissue engineering lab where cell tissue interaction with the materials are being tested, again the requirements will be of different type yet if you are a chemistry department which wants to a nurse cream different kind of fluorescent molecule, different kind of anti cancer drugs, a different kind of newly formulated compounds your requirements will be different	test
audio_0_77723.wav	So, because this is only an elemental length of delta x which is very small, I am putting a pressure of p plus delta p here	test

audio_0_112961.wav	Now, there are some components used in the laboratory	test
audio_0_224614.wav	Of course, this implementation may use various optimizations such as randomization and other things to make it faster, but at the underlying algorithm the heart of it is usually Quicksort	test
audio_0_28666.wav	We just write p 1 less then p 2 for readability enough in our program, and internally it will call a function less than lt, similarly greater than will call the function gt, and there is something for less than equal to greater then equal to and so on	test
audio_0_101636.wav	And more often many of the organisations prescribe that you should not actually use this should not use diamond in the multiple inheritance scenarios of course, that restricts the total use of multiple inheritance in a severe way	test
audio_0_172560.wav	As you can see as per Mager 1962 where his first book came; they already gave a mechanism of defining how to write a learning outcome or he called it instructional objective	test
audio_0_145914.wav	When the processing power is small, if we want to run a sophisticated operating system, then the overhead of the operating system will be so much that there will be hardly any time left for running the real time tasks	test
audio_0_113765.wav	Their difference is the power that is lost in this mismatch process, due to mismatch how much power is lost	test

audio_0_169914.wav	Now, we will it is easier to find the initial and final values for v and I because these are some things which can be considered or you can derive it while just doing the inspection of the circuit for time t is equal to 0 or time t tends to infinity	test
audio_0_156604.wav	So now this is the one schedule	test
audio_0_25868.wav	So, you could have as many except blocks as you have types of errors which you anticipate errors for it is not obligatory to handle every kind of error, only those which you anticipate and of course, now you might want to do something in general for all errors that you do not anticipate	test
audio_0_77098.wav	So, these are two imaging modes; contact mode being more suitable for flat rigid samples where there is no chance of damage to the sample because you are in perpetual contact with the sample and you have the tapping mode in which your intermittent contact and what you control is the amplitude set point	test
audio_0_191878.wav	We have concluded that, c equal to d	test
audio_0_2040.wav	So, this is sin 90 degree minus theta cos theta or cos 90 degree minus theta sin theta, there should not be any confuse right	test

audio_0_158186.wav	Traditional file systems may not be useful	test
audio_0_190007.wav	So, then we will show that then a1 has no factorization, that is because which violates then that factor terminates, because if this continues like this what we have is a1 can be written as a 2 times b 2 right	test
audio_0_229820.wav	What is monitoring of a process and operation	test
audio_0_174567.wav	And what happens as there is no sharp demarcation between cognitive levels	test
audio_0_38680.wav	So, that term c is equal to minus 1	test
audio_0_222438.wav	Then, we say that the level of the start vertex is 0, and now whenever we visit a new vertex, if it is level, if it is visited, then it must have a level	test
audio_0_44516.wav	So, what I am going to do is if I choose these points basically to be the midpoints of the segments, then I have a very clear unambiguous way of specifying how to solve this problem right	test
audio_0_146609.wav	If there are two tasks which are waiting, one is medium priority, one is high priority for the resource, then the lowest, the low priority task that is executing using the resource gets the priority of the highest of these two, so which is it	test
audio_0_204440.wav	Now, at 1 prime onwards, we have to draw horizontal	test
audio_0_13485.wav	But impedance, let me clear it, but impedance when you write z is equal to later we will see r plus jx, right	test

audio_0_114323.wav	So, that from the transmission line in the left or source side you see a Z naught thing	test
audio_0_165171.wav	Now, if you know the values of Z A, Z B, Z D, Z C, Z E so you can simply put the value it will be very simple equation, sometimes it is difficult to write in this form what you can alternatively do	test
audio_0_66389.wav	So, essentially the term which is coined was tissue culture, but over period of time; what we will be talking mostly about cell culture because the reason is there are different terms for all this things when you start with single cell you allow it to grow to form a mass or form a tissue; there is a next level, if you allow the tissue to in a three dimension that is called a plant sometime people directly get the explants	test
audio_0_110297.wav	So, there the constant reactance circles will be forming as if arcs	test
audio_0_109789.wav	So, the use of purple in Cadbury chocolates is one such instance	test
audio_0_97450.wav	Now this will have to get constructed	test
audio_0_56653.wav	and also you cannot use it in the event driven mode	test
audio_0_19286.wav	So, for different types of losses, we divide them into normal and abnormal and normal losses are treated differently	test
audio_0_50374.wav	what about physical interpretation of a	test
audio_0_132538.wav	so lets look over here again and make sure that we are doing it correctly	test
audio_0_26707.wav	So, 1 plus 0 is 1, 1 plus 1 is 2, 3, 5 and so on	test
audio_0_31165.wav	So, I mean yeah we usually thing that c is the very large value	test
audio_0_9164.wav	Now if we want that this will be your frequency domain the reactance mutual reactance will be omega into l l omega we have studied	test
audio_0_55161.wav	then from block level global placement you move to physical synthesis	test
audio_0_220415.wav	By this minimum separator lemma, this edge must line every spanning tree	test
audio_0_102570.wav	But we have new concepts here where it will say that a function can be instantiated, it could be an object it could have a state	test
audio_0_179292.wav	So, 2 of them have got the same asymptotic behaviour	test
audio_0_90485.wav	So, this occurs quite often what we see is that for example for this program is malicious it has found a bug in the operating system and it has created and exploit and has compromise the entire operating system	test
audio_0_204102.wav	So, now, we have completed this advanced mates and in the next lecture, we will go about learning this mechanical mates that are cam, slot, hinge, gear, rack pinion, screw and we will we already have	test
audio_0_234920.wav	I just want to stay at home and read	test
audio_0_106921.wav	But most likely there are if there are any objections either it could be technical objections, or it could be some substantial objection	test
audio_0_202929.wav	One way is you can always connect by lines, but you want better description naturally you require additional information on the curve has to go downward direction in that way, the curve has to go upward direction, the curve has to go upward direction and downward direction	test
audio_0_12008.wav	Now, here for your for our understanding what we have done is, here we have not taken it your what you call a sinusoidal waveform like that	test
audio_0_222830.wav	So, what we have seen in this unit is that we have seen, that a very natural algorithm, which we would apply if we did things by hand called selection sort can be formalized both iteratively and recursively and it gives us a complexity, which is order n square	test
audio_0_40561.wav	So, we should not apply any boundary condition on that, let's do its own thing	test
audio_0_185088.wav	52 B, the net benefit or the net capacity is 8	test

audio_0_202823.wav	This is the way we construct projections of lines, check our solution both the points a’ a on one side above that XY line	test
audio_0_48454.wav	so let this black one carry charge density rho, the red one carry charge density minus rho	test
audio_0_222236.wav	We ignore, may be the initialization that takes place before the loop or some print statement that takes place after the loop because that does not contribute as much to the complexity as the loop itself	test
audio_0_220693.wav	So, in general we can ask this question, if I think of these as DAG as representing courses, what is the minimum number of semesters	test
audio_0_100740.wav	Suppose you have called a function which is not within the try block and then this my exception has been raised	test
audio_0_181521.wav	For the 2G system, because GSM was designed with a 200 kilohertz system and if you recall the 200 kilohertz system means that your board rate, your symbol rate is basically as is 200 times per second approximately	test

audio_0_134976.wav	Many other concepts might not generate concrete images say for instance if you are told you know that there was a king he was very honest	test
audio_0_5616.wav	25 watt	test
audio_0_173612.wav	But the criteria remain the same for both	test
audio_0_193147.wav	So, it is a UFD and you have a factorization of a monomial like this	test
audio_0_190494.wav	So, let us say a plus b by 2, a and b are in Z ok	test
audio_0_148364.wav	The assignment 1 is actually pretty simple	test
audio_0_86127.wav	The way to do it is by specifying minus f no stack protector which would disable canaries and minus z execute stack which would permit execution from that stack	test
audio_0_63756.wav	so here you are saying that we are making the pipe line stages simpler, just like you do divide a computation into simpler sub computation and each of this stages we can either reduce the frequency or we can reduce the voltage, power supply voltage	test
audio_0_121453.wav	I asked the Kabiliwala, why did you give all these to her	test
audio_0_74556.wav	In contrast we have this other protein called dystrophin which kind of drugs when there is increased amount of water added ok	test
audio_0_214271.wav	so the next question will be: why did we actually start the discussion on risc and cisc at all	test
audio_0_221361.wav	So, this path is no longer a valid path	test
audio_0_173930.wav	You should be able to relate to that	test
audio_0_131677.wav	as we will see later, the splitter plate is also used	test
audio_0_217929.wav	so thats a good thing	test
audio_0_195510.wav	The common source amplifier is the other one	test
audio_0_190035.wav	But that means, the ideal generated by a is in the ideal generated by a1 right because a is a1 b1 ideal generated by a1 is in the ideal generated by a 2, because a1 is a 2 b 2, similarly the ideal generated by a 2 is in the ideal generated by a 3 and this continues forever, this does not stabilize	test
audio_0_111976.wav	So, this is a network analyzer you can connect with these; this is 1 port, this is another port, with this you connect your devices	test
audio_0_166443.wav	Basically it involves walking through this circuit	test
audio_0_128736.wav	this node at the bottom is the reference node and i have these three variables here: v one, v two and v three	test
audio_0_9408.wav	Now, the energy stored same as before in the capacitor is given by minus infinity to t p dt right	test
audio_0_235408.wav	Now, this is a very profound statement	test
audio_0_105331.wav	But if it does not match then I go and check if it is a manager	test
audio_0_97488.wav	The derived class object and you do not expect the base class the generalized object to be able to satisfy that	test
audio_0_91247.wav	Typically, in the passive mode or the output of this logic will be 0 in which case it acts as a regular 4 to 1 multiplexer depending on the values of S1 and S2, one of these inputs A, B, C and D would get switched to the output M	test
audio_0_188241.wav	When I print this confusion matrix, the result what I see is as follows	test
audio_0_71974.wav	So far we have only said that a task is much simpler, often repetitive, and no project management is necessary for a simple task	test
audio_0_132828.wav	why light and mass	test
audio_0_147927.wav	So, there is this whole idea of privacy the whole idea of using policing and online social networks, there is also credible information, misinformation on social network	test
audio_0_166540.wav	So, here we can say that the network is connected in series because you are adding up the voltages to get the complete network	test
audio_0_99435.wav	We are discussing about Inheritance in C++	test
audio_0_38164.wav	Circuit’s people call it impedance boundary condition for different reasons ok, but the physical interpretation is this I do not want to field to come back from a hypothetical non existence surface ok	test
audio_0_224972.wav	But, we assume that this should be recovered and we do not at you worry about it, if you are doing this in a language likes see, then you have to be very careful to this store this back to the free space	test
audio_0_13020.wav	So, similarly here also if you have this 3 ohm and this is 12 ohm 12 volt	test
audio_0_181543.wav	The other elements which I just wanted to point out the triangular or shape also tells us another important element that the radiation pattern of a cell phone tower is not 360 degrees it is actually only 120 degrees	test
audio_0_240123.wav	What kind the skills do we need them to have, in order to achieve the goals, that we set for them	test
audio_0_208413.wav	So, let us join these points through a smooth curve	test
audio_0_82616.wav	Because this is non inverting amplifier	test

audio_0_81243.wav	Now, since the same current flows through R and C right, if you see here current i1 flows through R and goes through C	test
audio_0_239676.wav	So, praise in public, and punish in private	test
audio_0_66144.wav	So, I will close in here please go through the points and think over it ponder upon it and develop your own philosophy about the subject	test
audio_0_230038.wav	Or you try to talk in terms of degrees it is possible, very very small deviations can be measured	test
audio_0_153802.wav	The theoretical approach felt that these conventional cues helped us in registering a social presence that is associated with certain levels of association	test
audio_0_39993.wav	Actually yeah, we have to move to the relative frame of the antenna element, so, even the original thing is fine as long as you are sure that z and z prime are in the same	test
audio_0_225151.wav	So, the first thing is that this is where the new node must come to contain 12	test
audio_0_94545.wav	and then the language, even if, as i said, you cannot send a message in marathi to a tamil or in tamil to a marathi or vice versa, because the words that you use may not be understood by the other party	test
audio_0_181388.wav	In the case of prepaid you know maybe this you carry your balance forward I do not know how it works, but in the case of postpaid you have to settle your accounts make sure that you know they have to return your a deposit and things like that	test
audio_0_230973.wav	What is the function of measurement	test
audio_0_35721.wav	So, this one is we have already interpreted in this case what is it saying that if I am inside V 2, the field is simply the field that is produced by these surface currents right, phi 2 is equal to this	test
audio_0_171367.wav	So these two things you have to always keep in mind, when you are asked to find the final value of the function f t that is f infinity	test
audio_0_133413.wav	You have the other expression now and then you realize that there is an outer brow movement to	test
audio_0_215901.wav	let us first look at what is the existing e p c code	test
audio_0_66177.wav	ok, so this journey becomes complicated when you are adding into the system another component which is a neuron which never divides	test
audio_0_211446.wav	he says: if you take my teg, my ah, my chip, my chip, three, one zero nine, l t c	test
audio_0_58075.wav	this one will be considered to be normalized, so for representation will be using only normalized expression	test
audio_0_45456.wav	This is the ratio of the on time by the total switching period	test

audio_0_83928.wav	So, what is it input offset current the difference in magnitudes of I b 1 and I b 2 is called input offset current; so, easy right	test
audio_0_84757.wav	It is used as a synchronized or trigger oscillators also used in pulse generation	test
audio_0_5713.wav	3 answer has to be same, so 2	test
audio_0_140838.wav	So, but, it so happens that for example firstly the secondary loop output is not a real output, so even if there is a steady state error we are not going to, we are not interested as I mean, per say to control that output	test
audio_0_72791.wav	These are some of the very fundamental principles of the Agile Model	test
audio_0_66380.wav	They are suspension and this is called the word which I used in the previous slide; single cell suspension	test
audio_0_170243.wav	So, the alternate way can be that, we represent the same into state variable methods	test
audio_0_181953.wav	What was transmitted by antenna 1 at time 1, what was transmitted by antenna 2 at time 1, multiplied by the corresponding coefficients	test

audio_0_121925.wav	So even though he is dull and inert physically in the context of traveling, he has a desire which he kind of satisfies by talking about traveling, by talking about other spaces and other places	test
audio_0_67280.wav	So now you have a collection vessel where you are collecting all the green ones similarly if there is a yellow one coming through	test
audio_0_192616.wav	So, the kernel is intersection	test
audio_0_64871.wav	so it was a technique which was using some analogy from the process of annealing of glass or metals, the way they are crystallized	test
audio_0_165203.wav	You have to just simply solve it because here you have only 1 unknown and you have got one equation to solve it, you simply take V 1 out and solve it you will get the value of V 1 as 79	test
audio_0_228760.wav	So, we are working on the type A uncertainties	test
audio_0_27619.wav	The second property about the heap is the values themselves	test
audio_0_233200.wav	You want more technology, to deal with	test
audio_0_216337.wav	peak detection algorithm is applied on vertical acceleration readings of accelerometer to detect this peaks	test
audio_0_76070.wav	In that context we had said I had said that there are 3 different types of Focal Adhesions the smallest being Focal Complexes	test
audio_0_231170.wav	Then we talk about levels of measurements; there are three types of levels; one is called as a primary level, the other one is called as a secondary level and the third one is called as a tertiary level	test
audio_0_132779.wav	ok, now, both the input and output to the flywheel because we are using a motor or a generator has to be in the form of ac or alternating current	test
audio_0_175873.wav	Now all, let us say you take a mechanical engineering program in several colleges	test
audio_0_81046.wav	So, when we look at the absolute maximum ratings at 25 degree centigrade, what we see supply voltage right Vcc we have seen that differential input voltage	test
audio_0_28453.wav	Supposing, we have defined a function square of x, which just returns x times x; and now we can say, apply square to the value 5 twice	test
audio_0_171690.wav	now, you need to find out the power delivered to an element at time t is equal to 3 milliseconds	test
audio_0_171686.wav	So, voltage is nothing but 3i that is 3 multiplied by the value of current i that come out to be 15cos60 pi t	test
audio_0_123035.wav	And then he leaves the world of Minnie because he has been arrested and he has been put in jail for several years, eight years in fact, and then he comes back later to kind of reclaim the friendship with the little girl	test
audio_0_2002.wav	Now, we will see the star connected load right	test
audio_0_31219.wav	Actually you took plus	test
audio_0_205492.wav	Again we have this symmetric object here and we would like to retain this part, remove this part	test
audio_0_61122.wav	so i have a circuit under test, c u, t	test
audio_0_221923.wav	So, we want the minimum value for any k in the middle, k between i and j or going for M i to M k and then from M k plus 1 to M j and the cost of the last multiplication which is r 1 into C k into C j	test
audio_0_20465.wav	I think you are right, it becomes a fixed cost because it becomes a cost for a period for one month or for 10 weeks or for 15 weeks or so on	test
audio_0_7902.wav	So, in that case what we what will do, will consider one source at a time, once will consider this voltage source or will consider the current source right	test
audio_0_219811.wav	It is useful to know that vertices is the plural of vertex, so vertex is one node, many nodes are called vertices and these connections are the edges	test
audio_0_1394.wav	And this is the mainframe it is cut actually it is cut right, and this is a typical slot to allow winding coil space need right one of many	test
audio_0_118579.wav	if the if demand is flat, penalty is zero	test
audio_0_147657.wav	Let us click on run	test
audio_0_24281.wav	You do not know which notes where have you kept those notes, you need an answer and you ask Suprativ do you have these notes	test
audio_0_138726.wav	Now for this purpose we, it is said it is that more than about 80 85% of all industrial controllers are a particular class of controllers called PID controller so they are generally this control algorithms used as a generic	test
audio_0_8888.wav	So, ah; so, if this all equation this is this is v 1, this is v 1, this is v 1, you can easily solve for voltage your v 1, right	test
audio_0_50481.wav	on the outer surface is the other way: p cosine theta is positive on the oppressive sphere and negative on the lower sphere, with the dependence b given as p cosine	test
audio_0_159786.wav	So we will define concurrency and all those things carefully	test
audio_0_159746.wav	So, suppose the previous example, transaction writes the new value to A and then it fails before B is being updated	test
audio_0_168211.wav	Now Q is measured in voltampere reactive just to distinguish it from real power P which is measured in watts	test
audio_0_217850.wav	you just remove it because there are no subscribers	test
audio_0_181549.wav	So, we have talked about frequency division duplex, time division duplex, uplink downlink, basic structure of a cell phone tower, but I do wanted to add to you a few more things which are useful for us to keep in mind as we study our first understanding of the cellular system	test
audio_0_227036.wav	Because it is it is working on the principal of the nut and screw it is just like loosening or tightening a screw, ok	test
audio_0_26854.wav	And if we have multiple keys then essentially this is one whole entry in this dictionary, and for the key test 1, I have these values; for the key test 2, I have these values	test
audio_0_140383.wav	And then, that those lines are those bits have to be transfer, transferred to the computer, so you need an interfacing mechanism by which the computer can accept the digital data, so these are the typical, you know, this is the part which is called the data acquisition system, this is the data acquisition system which will sometimes refer to as the DAS, so this overall process, what, does it, the sensing part is comes from the sensor which is typically not a, not part of the signal conditioning	test
audio_0_110408.wav	So, basically you have a so and so and C of so and so at 500 mega hertz	test
audio_0_57601.wav	ok, so this delay will be not just t p but u times t p, because the charging and discharging will take u times more, because the capacitance value will be u into c in	test
audio_0_132775.wav	so, flywheel over here, as the schematic is showing, its a rotating device, and what is happening is it is connected to a motor generator set	test
audio_0_20763.wav	Budget is always prepared for the next period	test
audio_0_80645.wav	When my I reference increases my M 2 is already in saturation right, I need to go back towards the current Io	test
audio_0_35096.wav	No more complicated what are the combination of sine and cos called you studied in first year singles and systems	test
audio_0_20433.wav	That is a total cost line	test
audio_0_163976.wav	Now, let us assume that at time t is equal to 0, the inductor has an initial current I naught and we can represent I at time t is equal to 0, is nothing but I naught	test
audio_0_223925.wav	Now, when we do breadth first search, we do a level by level explorations starting at one vertex, when we do depth first search each time we go to a new vertex, we switch the exploration to that vertex and whenever we reach a dead end we backup	test
audio_0_226173.wav	So, what is the effect to diam best wire method diameter, diameter is nothing, but P by 2 into secant x by 2 which is nothing, but where x where x is equal to 60 degrees, 60 degrees for metric thread	test
audio_0_50145.wav	in the first demonstration i have this tube on which a lot of wire has been wound	test
audio_0_8060.wav	So, from that you can find out there should not be any scope of confusion right so; that means, i 2 expression because i 2 is needed, because we will apply KCL at node 1 and KCL at node 2 so, i 2 is needed	test
audio_0_159911.wav	And once more we can argue that the second tree is more efficient than the first	test
audio_0_225098.wav	Therefore, we need an operation called delete max which will search for the highest priority job among those that are pending and schedule it next	test
audio_0_47324.wav	I have put two other schematics too let me show them to you in this folder one other schematic is like this you see here I have included two non idealities one is the track inductance from the source to the center of the bridge on the AC side	test
audio_0_97375.wav	So, you cannot pass it there, because if you can pass it there, then it can violate change anything and go ahead	test
audio_0_114740.wav	sequential placement locality existing when two instances run sequentially, right as we have seen that ah previously a and b parallel placement locality exist when two instances run at roughly the same time are often assigned to the same machine	test
audio_0_94383.wav	now, some of the group members has to show that responsibility that if there is a one person who is not trying to participate, you will have to ignite, you will have to encourage	test
audio_0_20374.wav	There is one more method known as constant gross margin method where it is assumed that the gross margin is constant and reducing that much of gross profit the cost is estimated	test
audio_0_11830.wav	So, all this angle you have to voltage and angle you have to consider right	test
audio_0_27171.wav	So obviously, it reads from beginning to the end, but if you are reading one line at a time then the way it works is that when we open the file we are initially at the beginning of the file	test
audio_0_84624.wav	Then we have seen closed loop amplifier trade off gain	test
audio_0_1250.wav	If you I mean based in this assumption you substitute those your S max t your S max t your what you call your expression, you put r Thevenin 0 and S Thevenin 0 you will get S is equal to S max t is equal to r 2 dash upon x 2 dash	test
audio_0_8559.wav	This one is unity power factor as 100 KVA transfer half load the half into 100 into 1000 into 1, so 50 10 to the power 3 watt right	test
audio_0_40053.wav	So, Tm dot this is going to be a scalar	test
audio_0_229891.wav	So, in there are processes where only one is involved, there are processes where two thing two process variables are involved, there are where are all the three is involved	test
audio_0_151223.wav	So, this is generally the structure that we saw even the last time, meaning almost all papers appears see the structure would be the same a paragraph about the 30,000 feet high view of the problem	test
audio_0_13049.wav	So, 6 ohm and 3 ohm, they are in parallel, but we have to find out v 0	test
audio_0_138672.wav	Similarly for safety you will find lots of you know various kinds of really pressure release valves, or various kinds of interlocks, because these are you know powerful devices so if the malfunction they may cause accidents	test
audio_0_166859.wav	Now, what is the next task	test
audio_0_107083.wav	So, universities with predominantly doing the role of doing the research, but the research that the university would do; the moment it comes within the purview something that commercial entity is interested	test
audio_0_56599.wav	here we generate a test vector, t i, to detect a fault f i	test
audio_0_220930.wav	So, initially, in the first iteration, if I have my heap looking like this, this is my maximum	test
audio_0_68437.wav	because whenever we talk about any kind of culture as i mentioned in the last ah couple of classes, i am continuously hinting out on that just growing them, throwing them in a dish, something grows, something happens, doesnt make any sense in the modern day	test
audio_0_132046.wav	so we burn, basically, primarily we burn, fuel in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine and the hot ah gas, hot product of combustion does some work in the gas turbine	test
audio_0_83245.wav	So, this is the first thing we are considering, this value which is i1 then we will consider the value which is right over here i1	test
audio_0_171344.wav	So at infinity the value will be zero	test
audio_0_148893.wav	As I have said before, abstract only summarizes what is in the paper then in the introduction you talk about the whole growth of Twitter, in terms of why it is, how users are actually using it and what kind of data is being pushed onto twitter, so that is what is being discussed here	test
audio_0_27775.wav	A final use of heap is to actually sort, we are taking out one element at a time starting with maximum one	test
audio_0_188197.wav	The arguments it takes are train, test, cl and k	test
audio_0_145639.wav	The rest of the time T2 can run and you can see that it will complete at 90	test
audio_0_147504.wav	Location, blah, blah, blah, not a single police posted here, I was waiting for an auto at the circle blah, blah, blah right	test
audio_0_180794.wav	Good evening, let us start the lecture	test
audio_0_53445.wav	i should have the pointing vector is coming in incident should be equal to the energy which is transmitted plus the energy which is reflected, s reflected plus s transmitted	test
audio_0_180746.wav	If you know only if you full response you will able to what is not full response becomes partial response full response	test
audio_0_239671.wav	One formula, that faujis is that, that the people in the armed forces, have taught me is, praise in public, punish in private	test
audio_0_185147.wav	Retransmission, no problem we have solution for that	test
audio_0_55448.wav	so n two will be following first c three, then c thirteen, then c nine, then c eight, then n three	test
audio_0_21023.wav	So, what is going to change is only your contribution which will change the operating profit	test
audio_0_239276.wav	This is what, I am going to assess	test
audio_0_103175.wav	We have put messages in the construct and destructor, so that we can trace and understand what is going on	test
audio_0_99556.wav	Now, naturally if the compiler provides a free invocation then a compiler cannot set a parameter to the base class constructor	test
audio_0_201729.wav	Here, there is a hole which goes all the way down	test
audio_0_158034.wav	So data redundancy is done to improve the reliability	test
audio_0_47793.wav	But the switch, if it blocks, then you will see that the inductor current goes like that	test
audio_0_120373.wav	A number of times he had beaten them with his own hands for theft or for not coming to work as they had promised	test
audio_0_143722.wav	Of course, we are going in a hurry	test
audio_0_130982.wav	in ah proper sense we can extract the waste heat to the maximum amount possible	test
audio_0_180314.wav	So, lecture 22 we did look at the following the Rice or Rician fading	test
audio_0_32490.wav	The trouble we said is that we do not typically know how is the current distributed along the length of the wire; I mean, I know what is the voltage at the current at the point of connected, but across the length I do not know what is J as a function of space	test
audio_0_65792.wav	So, and you have to have a chamber this kind of a chamber like you know where you keep the animal, and you have to have a gas supply something like this and we allow the animal to have a peaceful death and then whatever way you wanted to dissect it out or you decapitating the head or you wanted to remove some kind of a gut tissue or some kind of muscle or you wanted to do a isolate the cardiac tissue you want to isolate the brain	test
audio_0_194513.wav	Now we are left with positive integers beginning with 2 and I claim that for each of those we can determine whether it is a prime ideal or not simply by looking at n	test
audio_0_174826.wav	So these represent really action verbs	test
audio_0_3566.wav	So, with this thank you very much we will be back again	test
audio_0_210644.wav	So, for that purpose we go to sketch, pick hexagon 6 units from here draw it	test
audio_0_94562.wav	in addition to this, you also need to see that you have employed a sort of curse in your communication	test
audio_0_26263.wav	Earlier, we had given a map filter thing	test
audio_0_163576.wav	5 lambda not, so that is why, if you see an Yagi array, you can easily identify the reflector and the directors by this, reflector is the maximum of the log, the driven dipole you can always identify what the feed is given and director	test
audio_0_186323.wav	Since the sequence runs up to 5 the sum will be 15 at the end of 5 iterations, sometimes it is necessary to stop the function when you feel that the required condition is satisfied	test
audio_0_61169.wav	that will you reduce the volume of the test data to a relatively small volume and you can use a small rom to store the correct response for that small value after compaction	test
audio_0_59380.wav	i assume that the pins are residing at the centers of blocks and i calculate how many interconnection lines are there between this block and this block, that is, c i j between block i and block j	test
audio_0_44421.wav	So, this is where r prime should be right for equation 1 and this is where r prime should be for equation	test
audio_0_211303.wav	v out and the i out, the, the current and voltage out at the output	test
audio_0_186224.wav	Now instead of leaving one out, we will leave one group out	test
audio_0_217123.wav	this is the big summary of ah, of the system	test
audio_0_34745.wav	Now, and this does not in any way force me to have H to be you know sub domain basis functions or entire domain basis H is H whatever it is so a very general	test
audio_0_198151.wav	So, what we have done is to use the principle of AC coupling to connect the signal source to the gate source and the load RL to the drain source	test
audio_0_196689.wav	Let's now come to the capacitor C2 and while computing the constraint for capacitor C2 the independent source of course is set to 0 so it becomes a short circuit, it is a voltage source which is 0 and the capacitor C1 we assume has been chosen properly so that is also a short circuit	test
audio_0_162211.wav	We will you see that the oscillations also so, are all confined to plus 1 to minus 1	test
audio_0_11690.wav	So, it is angle is 45 degree now V L is j into X L	test
audio_0_226874.wav	So, heating, focusing, vertical plates, horizontal plates, screen, luminous happen; so, this is the schematic diagram of a CRO	test
audio_0_176742.wav	And understand the centrality of closing the quality loop at the attainment of outcomes at the levels of COs, POs, and PSOs	test
audio_0_55560.wav	this means that what is the total negative slack sensitivity to the net weight	test
audio_0_145991.wav	7, less than 0	test
audio_0_147882.wav	So, the messages were sent on Twitter or Facebook saying that lets go to this site in this street	test
audio_0_65279.wav	it means net	test
audio_0_158467.wav	It is essentially one seek because it needs to go to the beginning of the where the relation is stored	test
audio_0_61911.wav	so w and two w is our typical value	test
audio_0_47291.wav	Now see the operation is exactly same as before	test
audio_0_174742.wav	So to that extent course outcomes have to be related to the POs and PSOs	test
audio_0_66321.wav	Similarly, several mathematical tools similarly like statics there are these are tools, but if you know the tools and the origin of the tools and the power of the tools, it will help you to become much wiser in designing our problem	test
audio_0_34895.wav	Electric field let us see what happens electric field which term should I keep	test
audio_0_212174.wav	see, this one is being an n mos series pass element	test
audio_0_110514.wav	Now, if you take that alternate part you can get 2 other things	test
audio_0_103366.wav	They just say that the pure virtual functions do not have a body, but I am just clarifying that it is not the pure virtual functions do not have a body; pure virtual functions may not have a body	test
audio_0_172437.wav	So, we will again put the Independent Sources back to the circuit, and then we will find the voltage that is open circuit voltage across the terminal of network A	test
audio_0_141272.wav	Then we have started looking at the long term liquidity of the company	test
audio_0_175829.wav	We ask you to do two	test
audio_0_121603.wav	Earlier, Rauta was the only one who was supreme in numbers, who was extraordinary in calculating numbers and who was extremely efficient in doing the sums	test
audio_0_207168.wav	So, we are having a slice in that direction, it looks like circle	test
audio_0_221983.wav	So, of course, there must be a catch and the catch is how do we find the median	test
audio_0_175083.wav	Knowing one’s emotions you have to manage the emotions	test
audio_0_231248.wav	With this we try to see will try to understand what is measurement	test
audio_0_49398.wav	so again, if i write, if i, again, if you are given a cylinder shell having information density sigma, so potential at point p, and this is the charge element which is given by r, t, phi, prime, d, z, prime into sigma, so this is a charge element	test
audio_0_83255.wav	So, Vplus would be nothing but R2 by R1 plus R2, v plus would be nothing but R2 divided by R1 plus R2 into V2 right	test
audio_0_144814.wav	So capital 2 lakhs, mortgages 4 lakhs and payables 150, they are same as in earlier balance sheet	test
audio_0_169123.wav	So in the linear circuit the output is linearly related to it input	test
audio_0_32636.wav	So, case 1 is this	test
audio_0_209778.wav	The first step is from K because now B is a shorter line if we are picking very large radius; from K, if I am going to mark, it will be extending	test
audio_0_31677.wav	n 1 right this is the outward normal, because I am looking at all the flux that is leaving this volume	test
audio_0_175563.wav	Nobody will ever touch that	test
audio_0_227952.wav	So, the deflection type transducer works on the principle that a measured quantity produced a physical effect that stimulates an analogous effect in the opposite direction in some part of the measuring instrument I repeat works on the principle that the measured quantity produces a physical effect measured quantity is displacement quantity produces a physical effect that stimulates an analogous effect in the opposite direction in some part of the measuring instrument	test
audio_0_37219.wav	So, with these considerations its sort of very common choice for the TM stencil is as follows right	test
audio_0_9000.wav	So, hence phi 1 is equal to phi 1 1 plus phi 1 2 right the total flux	test
audio_0_228991.wav	219 so let me bring it back to the second place of decimal, ok, lower control limit is there	test
audio_0_138831.wav	Things like, you know functional block diagrams or ladder diagrams, these are graphical languages, on the other hand there may be some several text based languages, for example structured text or instruction list, these are some of the kinds of programming paradigms, I already told that, that although we are learning about the RLL, there are several other programming paradigms which are also supported by various manufacturers	test
audio_0_56264.wav	but what if the pulse that is apply to clock is so narrow that the flip flop is not able to register	test
audio_0_163629.wav	It has also been found that at a given frequency the currents in all elements, except those that are close to lambda by two long are very small that is obvious, because actually what is happening at a particular frequency only one structure is resonating, so that one is having sizable current	test
audio_0_162434.wav	So, we can easily say that A will also be z directed and vector Helmholtz equation turns to be that del square Az plus k square Az is equal to minus mu sorry, minus mu Jz	test
audio_0_152760.wav	Another aspect is that his mouth has been covered which is indicative of a possible deception or a desire to create a certain barrier between himself and the other people	test
audio_0_12556.wav	And now you connect that R L is equal to 4 ohm resistance in terminal work loss terminal 1 and 2	test
audio_0_1123.wav	So, V Thevenin will be v into j x m upon r 1 plus j x 1e plus x m	test
audio_0_219143.wav	Now, to continue with Fibonacci of 3 I need to go back to Fibonacci of 1, of course, it is the base case, but what my table thing tells us, tells you is that you should look at the table first	test
audio_0_101331.wav	There is a side effect of using reference parameter	test
audio_0_20786.wav	Because budget is essentially a plan, it is a set of targets or goal which is often essential to lead and focus individual and group actions	test
audio_0_183466.wav	So, what I would like to do is not go through the complete derivation, but give you enough pointers that you can then pick up and read the proofs that that are given to us	test
audio_0_224585.wav	So, now the behavior of this algorithm is not fixed, it depends on how this die rolls	test
audio_0_99141.wav	So, that has no constructor, but the other three strings will get constructed next, which give you the street name, the city name and the pin and then the address object gets constructed	test
audio_0_174166.wav	Like sometimes saying the teacher should like facilitate the student to learn something	test
audio_0_58272.wav	so if you do it, the delay, the slack that was four, that will get decremented by four, because now the entire path delay has increased by four units	test
audio_0_43710.wav	Is a relation between the magnitude of E and the magnitude of H right there is a eta	test
audio_0_12874.wav	So, that is your 5 volt	test
audio_0_50783.wav	so the pointing vector this is magnitude and direction is readily awkward	test
audio_0_38669.wav	So, integrating the delta function and our integral is including the origin over here that is my S epsilon right	test
audio_0_98421.wav	The notable of this is a very first point, you see an operator is always written in the terms of an infix notation, this is how an operator written	test
audio_0_166058.wav	But if you can redraw the circuit in such a way that it can become a planar circuit then you can use the mesh current method to analyse it	test
audio_0_239852.wav	I do not know, how this will be made available	test
audio_0_1693.wav	Similarly, here in this 6 ohm resistance 6 ohm resistance when you see that there what is that voltage drop across 6 ohm resistance it will be actually because we have to apply your what we call that your KVL	test
audio_0_222587.wav	We can have two types of edges, undirected edges and directed edges	test
audio_0_106176.wav	By property we understand as something that can be possessed, and something that can be transferred	test

audio_0_15199.wav	62 into n 1 upon n 2 actually, 1 upon 0	test
audio_0_60075.wav	the idea is that suppose i have a rectangular area in which i have to layout the points	test
audio_0_44644.wav	So these two are going to decide the value of R and the power dissipation is determined only by frequency and the inductance and magnetizing current components	test
audio_0_13549.wav	Or current reaching to 0 before your what you call after your voltage becomes 0 or currents lags from the voltage	test
audio_0_34824.wav	So, what is its saying	test
audio_0_236184.wav	We have, egoism	test
audio_0_130681.wav	i put a magnetic field, by the way, that i should ah first also denote over here by this green dot	test

audio_0_13289.wav	This is equation 38, this equation can be written like this; that r t is equal to 0 or t less than equal to 0 and is equal to t for t greater than or equal to 0	test
audio_0_26612.wav	So, we can in general talk about x i to x j	test
audio_0_14623.wav	So, to get this what you do apply here K V L	test
audio_0_180115.wav	Now, let me ask you an interesting question, you saw this graph for when your talking about interference limited system	test
audio_0_149344.wav	This is exactly the same response you saw from the Graph API explorer, except that this has no line breaks, so it is harder to understand in this format	test
audio_0_79215.wav	So, what you see here this molecule called FAK	test
audio_0_53551.wav	ok, i leave this as an exercise for you	test
audio_0_200415.wav	So, what happens is whatever train current is there or the output current that goes through R1 and there is a voltage I0 R1 across R1 and that is also the source voltage of the MOS transistor	test
audio_0_173176.wav	So each branch has its own research methods	test
audio_0_91710.wav	So, having this format what is the beauty now that we can write down in the form of a sum that this P 1 here is i goes from 0 to 1 we have this so called the Lagrange polynomial of degree 1 and then we have f x i the value of the function at x i	test
audio_0_146197.wav	And once a task acquires the resource, its priority is increased to be equal to the ceiling value	test
audio_0_147253.wav	And of course, there the police is being part of the social media, social networks for some time now	test
audio_0_142435.wav	So, differentiation of capital expenditure and revenue expenditure was made and expenditure is of two kinds	test

audio_0_1414.wav	Wherever you see the current this conductor are there	test
audio_0_44523.wav	So, that will become clear as we go along ah	test
audio_0_125068.wav	ok, up to node n, there are total of n plus one nodes in the circuit	test
audio_0_221921.wav	So, I will add some M j plus 1 to M k, so I would get arbitrary segments from 1 to n as my sub problems	test
audio_0_115458.wav	but these are the possible threats	test
audio_0_5874.wav	So, either generator and batteries you can you can be regarded as your ideal voltage sources that way we will think	test
audio_0_153767.wav	Now, that we know that there can be differences even within the western world it is not surprising that middle eastern nations different (Refer Time: 29:28) from the US	test
audio_0_71322.wav	There is a overall design and then each time one increment is taken, developed, validated, integrated with previous increment, the system is validated and delivered to the customer, feedback is taken, next increment is developed and so on until the final system is obtained	test
audio_0_81759.wav	So now, why I have kept both the power supplies here is that lot of universities may still use this DC power supply or may use advanced version	test
audio_0_229640.wav	02 plus and 0	test
audio_0_204315.wav	For concentric selection we wish to have this particular face to align with this face as concentric and the faces to be coincident are this face and this face	test
audio_0_184074.wav	So, basically here is the proposition, I have a following scenario	test

audio_0_149693.wav	The third V is veracity and the forth V is Volume; volume is the size of the content that is getting generated which is very much connected to the velocity also, which is 400 hours of videos getting generated every 60 seconds on YouTube, which is also the space that its, and that much of space it is going to occupy, which is the reference to volume	test
audio_0_34946.wav	We took Maxwell’s equations and then and did finite differences right so, finite	test
audio_0_76952.wav	So, that is the challenge how can you assign the peaks to specific domains	test
audio_0_143291.wav	Now let us go to a small case where perhaps you will understand how to make a small P&L and balance sheet	test
audio_0_81983.wav	But so, you can connect resistors like this, you see resistors are like this, all right	test
audio_0_63364.wav	so this allows multi terminal nets also	test
audio_0_171716.wav	Now, physical sources such as batteries maybe regarded as approximation to the ideal voltage sources	test
audio_0_21176.wav	That's why this is a more detailed recording of costs that is involved	test
audio_0_119725.wav	the software layer	test
audio_0_139883.wav	So, we will take it, somewhat detail look at these	test
audio_0_155342.wav	As far as social stereotypes are concerned, male roles are associated with proactive behavior, whereas women are normally associated with reactive behaviors	test
audio_0_5655.wav	So, let me clear it, equation will see later	test
audio_0_151451.wav	This just gives you a sense and the highlighted is basically to tell you how the differences are, where in terms of the topics	test
audio_0_163075.wav	So, we can written the array factor since it is two dimensional, so we are writing explicitly the sin angle that we are expressing in terms of theta phi, where you can note that we have used this that a r cross a x is sin theta cos phi, and a r cross a z	test
audio_0_237768.wav	And, these things are, culturally determined	test
audio_0_166072.wav	Now, how you will do the mesh analysis	test
audio_0_19562.wav	That means your variable cost should be 15	test
audio_0_100192.wav	And then if we take their addresses and try to print the fields	test
audio_0_37961.wav	So, when I when I take dot product means I multiply the x components you will have y squared	test
audio_0_169287.wav	So minus i4 would because of this one open resistance 10i5 because there are 3 resistance of total value of 10 Ohm minus 20 for this voltage source and plus 5 i0 double dash for this dependent voltage source	test
audio_0_181634.wav	So, from the broadcast control channel you will be asked to move to another frequency another timeslot and then that becomes your channel on which the communication happens	test
audio_0_219914.wav	So, it is not saying that there are not optimal values away from vertices, but definitely there will be some vertex which has an optimum value	test
audio_0_47673.wav	And during the time when this is off, the diode is freewheeling and the port voltage is connected to the ground	test
audio_0_5704.wav	Then example 6 are using nodal analysis, you have to determine i x right of the circuit	test
audio_0_25875.wav	So, finally, if I had only a zero division error in this particular example then, since it is not an index error and it is not a name error, it would try to go through these in turns that would come here find this is not a type of error	test
audio_0_3215.wav	So, this term you put is equal to 1 such that 1 plus 1 you are getting 2 right	test
audio_0_225493.wav	So, we can instantly find it in constant time	test
audio_0_196079.wav	Then you have this current division between this resistor and this branch	test
audio_0_58645.wav	so you will have to multiple this by this: t into f	test
audio_0_1531.wav	Because it is going into the paper right or in to the plane and this is the direction of the flux	test
audio_0_132567.wav	so what do we need	test
audio_0_193245.wav	So, now, if you expand this and combine; so, I will quickly do this and you can check the it is correct you will have X cubed term plus 3 X squared and there will be another 3 X squared that will be 6 X squared plus there will be a 3 X here and 6 X here	test
audio_0_197809.wav	But of course frequently you can very quickly dismiss some of the possibilities	test
audio_0_102098.wav	Now in terms of the layout therefore, we have discussed about the layout that, in the layout if a derive class inherits from a base class then it contains an instance of the base class objects	test
audio_0_237006.wav	Concern for process	test
audio_0_76789.wav	ESCs are cells which are isolated from the Blastocysts	test
audio_0_63742.wav	lets assume their all of equal size, means they take equal times	test
audio_0_185881.wav	So, there are 2 terms here 2 x 1 squared plus 4 x 2 squared and the lowest value that each one of these could take has to be 0 and that basically means the unconstrained minimum is at x 1 equal to 0 x 2 equal to 0 the objective value at that point is also 0	test
audio_0_134533.wav	But experimental method basically it gives you accurate and objective measurement	test
audio_0_47722.wav	So you see that you get again here a lot of information in rating the components	test
audio_0_96086.wav	this language appears to be very insulting, isnt it	test
audio_0_142869.wav	Now go to 1C that is deferred tax asset	test
audio_0_26901.wav	So, this is just to emphasize that the order in which keys are inserted into the dictionary is not going to be the order in which they are presented to through the keys function	test
audio_0_202101.wav	Let us click this four view	test
audio_0_38441.wav	Can you think of a relation or a condition where you will get the ratio that like we got in this case, we got the ratio that omega by k is equal to c over here when I took delta x delta t tending to 0	test
audio_0_47607.wav	But the uncoupled part there will be some leakage inductance and that will give rise to an LDI by DT drop	test
audio_0_193079.wav	Remember, what is this ring homomorphism	test
audio_0_210245.wav	So, in wireframe model we do not show this kind of hidden lines, but it contains vertices V and these edges	test
audio_0_8459.wav	Determine the voltage across the inductor and the energy stored in it since we know that v is equal to L into di by dt and L is given 0 point 0 1 Henry and i t is given 5 t your what you call into e to the power minus 10 t it is given it is given, so v is equal to your what you call L into d dt of i e	test
audio_0_54661.wav	in other boundary condition is that again, look at in this surface, look at e here: e on side one, e on side two	test
audio_0_152084.wav	So this is one of the questions that I asked which is what you feel about privacy of your personal information on your online social network, which is about Facebook	test
audio_0_16858.wav	So, this is your this is your E 2 this is your E 2, right in this circuit also this is my E 1 this is your E 2 and this is plus minus, right	test
audio_0_230659.wav	However, in modern days slip gauges or gauge blocks owe their existence to the pioneering work done by Johansson, a Swedish armoury inspector therefore, the gauge block is sometime called as Johanasson’s gauge	test
audio_0_148935.wav	So, as I said before in related work that there is mention of three different types of domains in this three different areas that this paper attacks which is evolving user behavior how users are actually changing the behavior online	test
audio_0_159052.wav	Now let us consider another schedule and see what may happen with such a schedule	test
audio_0_93763.wav	you will find that there are many people among us who do not take part in any organizational activity only because he feels he will have to listen to others	test
audio_0_168772.wav	Now, the basic understanding of singularity function will help you to understand the response of first order circuit to a sudden application of independent voltage or current source	test
audio_0_14774.wav	So, moving downwards, so it is v 2 by 3 right now with this ah you apply your K C L at the because this is a common node you apply K C L here	test
audio_0_135225.wav	So that you can make the line equivalent to the arrow headed line, please do	test
audio_0_173680.wav	Either locating the outcomes at the right level or making the assessment in alignment with outcomes or planning instruction making sure that your instruction is in line with what you wanted your student to be able to do	test
audio_0_79684.wav	So, you would discretize this network into small small zones, you have these zones levelled from 1 at one end to whatever let us say 40 at the other end and you would plot, your x axis is time and y axis is whatever you are plotting but along the edge	test
audio_0_29260.wav	Let us revisit what we lean by a data structure	test
audio_0_156710.wav	So, log is maintained on a stable storage	test
audio_0_66291.wav	ok, so in this frog segment, what we are trying to do and is kind of exposing you to those technologies which are still not part of textbook	test
audio_0_183445.wav	Well, number of fades per second tells me that I have to send as that many training sequences so that I can estimate the channel, because I assume that every time there is a fade I lose track of the channel and I must need a help the receiver needs help	test
audio_0_39720.wav	So, the Q factor also comes out	test
audio_0_9710.wav	So, at resonance omega 0 is equal to 1 upon root over L C that you know	test
audio_0_131121.wav	ok, so what i have also shown at the bottom is a link which will, which also nicely explains, ah, um, the functioning of pressurized water storage	test
audio_0_59340.wav	and the individual blocks are there	test
audio_0_142191.wav	There are equal number of debits and credits	test
audio_0_72740.wav	Also we will discuss about this the size measure because I have already told you the one of the initial measure is size	test
audio_0_53889.wav	so in free space if i have a charge distribution which has this charge distribution, rho r prime, then the potential at r is going to be given by this formula: v r equals one over four pi epsilon zero	test
audio_0_185024.wav	So, both R x and T x know the PDF like before, they know that it is Rayleigh statistics or Rician whatever it is both R x and T x know the PDF of gamma	test
audio_0_222311.wav	Now, one thing we observed is that, typically in many graphs, this matrix is largely 0, most pairs are not connected	test
audio_0_102126.wav	And what I have done is this is f int in the derived class I have included a member function with the same signature which means this is a case of overriding	test
audio_0_174248.wav	Now you have to write for a complete course making sure that all the items in the checklist are addressed to and do’s and don’ts are also observed	test
audio_0_28577.wav	And on the other hand, if I have x and y then I can recover r as we just did for o distance it's the square root of x square plus y square, and theta so y by x is actually if you if you divided y by x you get tan of theta that is because it's sin divided by cos and the r cancels	test
audio_0_36422.wav	But, can I say that while looking at this equation	test
audio_0_60043.wav	now you see, from here again you have take another detour to reach t because there is no other path in the right direction	test
audio_0_56695.wav	now, after i compute z, i make corrections or modifications to the bits to incorporate the effect of the faults here	test
audio_0_209588.wav	So, that specialized algorithms it takes and by just clicking it it automatically takes and chamfers the thing	test
audio_0_48366.wav	so if you want to calculate the potential and electric field in this region, we place an image charge q one at x equals minus d	test
audio_0_132801.wav	so if you need high omega, then what happens	test
audio_0_75276.wav	First of all, read the Pelham and Wang paper	test
audio_0_203929.wav	In the last lecture, we learned about some basic assembly methods that were some standard mates available in solid works	test
audio_0_161713.wav	And it is restarted	test
audio_0_76518.wav	So, FN 3 has 15 individual domains which fold by themselves	test
audio_0_139289.wav	Points to ponder, give, so you have, you mentioned what for, what kind of processes cascade control is likely to be effective, so take some examples and an examine how the, how the two subsystems should be such that process control using is effective	test
audio_0_168979.wav	So at this axis it is shifting and we are trying to find out the value of the product at each and every point and ten you are integrating means you are summing up all the products and then you are again you are taking another location and finding out the product	test
audio_0_169810.wav	So lets us first take the voltage source	test
audio_0_9106.wav	When both are your both sized current are your injected we will see later right	test
audio_0_86735.wav	The third instruction this one here moves the content of X that is present in this location EBP plus 8, which essentially is the argument this particular function	test
audio_0_168537.wav	Now Vf is the forced or steady state response so if you see from the figure which is the modified circuit when the switch is opened so the Vs the final value that is value of Vf is nothing but Vs because when the capacitor is charged to its value the current will be 0	test
audio_0_183166.wav	So, the duplex method that is used for GSM, GSM uses an FDD’s duplexing frequency division duplexing, it the CDMA system uses a FDD system FDD also and the LTE the fourth generation can have an FDD or TDD system	test
audio_0_191732.wav	It is a simple fact, right if you multiplied two nonzero polynomials over an integral domain the product is also nonzero	test
audio_0_71540.wav	For example, suppose there is a safe deposit tracking system that saves 20 minutes preparing customer notices compared with the manual system	test
audio_0_75471.wav	So, this limit the authors named as a nuclear deformation limit	test
audio_0_94153.wav	the the reduction of this hidden area can promote in ensuring a sort of cooperation, trust and help in learning and in creating a sort of atmosphere where all the members of the group, in some way or the other, they are enriching each other and they are working for a common cause and for a common goal, and that is possible only through a proper interaction	test
audio_0_94851.wav	so, because you know, a good presentation or a good speech also attracts its audience in the beginning and that interest of the audience has to be sustained	test
audio_0_95033.wav	also, time yourself either where you want, with the help of the cell phone or with the help of a clock whatsoever	test
audio_0_51524.wav	so what i have is a bulk here which is giving out radiation in all the direction and we want to see at one meter, what is the associated electric field	test
audio_0_239926.wav	If you help the employees, break up this goal, of going through their training, into smaller parts	test
audio_0_76497.wav	So, in essence if for example if this is your first domain your first domain will not unfold, but second and third will	test
audio_0_167604.wav	So you say that there are 3 meshes that is i1 may be i2 and i3, so rather then writing the mesh equation and correspondingly finding out the nodal equation what we will simply do we will simply use the analogy, we will say what is the dual of which particular circuit element and then we will draw the dual circuit	test
audio_0_230698.wav	005 millimeters	test
audio_0_185127.wav	So, the system has to operate at a fixed rate, has to operate at the fixed rate	test
audio_0_48830.wav	Let the size of the box be a in the x direction, b in the y direction and c in the z direction	test
audio_0_27220.wav	Here is a typical thing that you would like to do in python, which is to process it line by line	test
audio_0_3887.wav	So, this will be in active because it is a short circuit right and in that case you have to your inductor will behave like a short circuit ah your	test
audio_0_78894.wav	What you see is underneath the cells there are these zones, which has is present as black patches, which are absent and which are present right underneath the cell	test
audio_0_58644.wav	sw multiplied by t, this will give you at how many times this charging and discharging is taking place within this time period t	test
audio_0_225289.wav	So, this is the component j and it contains i, j, k, l, so you can see that the element i has a pointer not to itself, but to another nodes	test
audio_0_215577.wav	you put a high gain antenna	test
audio_0_102682.wav	Now the special window decides to override the on resize function and implement it again	test
audio_0_230345.wav	The availability is pretty high	test
audio_0_163682.wav	So, let us recall that for a current element ideal what was our magnetic vector potential magnetic vector potential was mu naught; this is for current a current element hertzian dipole	test
audio_0_6400.wav	So, question is that your this is shorted this is shorted	test
audio_0_155039.wav	However, it can also be understood as a negative quality in those context where women are being judged as mannish in patriarchal context	test
audio_0_100620.wav	We will say try throw catch; kind of or try catch for simple terms	test
audio_0_34063.wav	So, corner region over here where will it get the wave from	test
audio_0_200245.wav	What is the measure that we want	test
audio_0_114450.wav	So, you see that we have taken instead of Z l, we can represent the load as Y l from Y l after adding these things	test
audio_0_141365.wav	They are sometimes also called as efficiency or performance or turnover ratios because here we calculate how better or how efficiently the company is able to utilize their assets	test
audio_0_59321.wav	ok, those are called flexible blocks	test
audio_0_32750.wav	Now is the term which I have to be careful of r hat dot n hat which is going to be give me now	test
audio_0_52544.wav	just like we identified an electrostatics, this vector, epsilon zero e plus p, as it is placement vector, we are going to identify here, this vector, here b minus mu naught m, as an auxiliary vector	test
audio_0_187992.wav	So, in order to check, if your linear model is good	test
audio_0_174032.wav	So to that extent all instruction design theories are design theories in nature and they are intended to provide direct guidance to practitioners about what methods to use to attain different goals	test
audio_0_236015.wav	And, that can be detrimental to humanity, at large, sometimes	test
audio_0_8836.wav	So, minus 2, then encountering plus terminal pass plus v 2 in encountering minus terminal pass	test
audio_0_141311.wav	75 by 25 means 3 is to 1	test
audio_0_35369.wav	So, scattering problem a typical problem is for example, there is a aircraft right, this is supposed to be an aircraft and it has some various components inside it and what are we trying to do, we are trying to find out the RCS of this object now, if I were to solve this	test
audio_0_115131.wav	so there are, because whenever i communication	test
audio_0_180564.wav	And the expression for the Ricean pdf is given here I naught being a Bessel, a special case of a Bessel function	test
audio_0_199365.wav	If you don't want to use a large inductor here you have to use a resistor	test
audio_0_182128.wav	So, at the receiver what the receivers sees enemy receiver will receive this red it has no clue what this red means	test
audio_0_105707.wav	For instance, somebody comes up with a medicine and calls it cancer cure and wants to get a mark for the word cancer cure	test
audio_0_131365.wav	in the first case, when there is regenerative feed heating, we will get higher efficiency but, as i have told, the work output will be lower	test
audio_0_228733.wav	66 degrees Fahrenheit	test
audio_0_175397.wav	That is continuous improvement	test
audio_0_38434.wav	No, that is to enforce the I mean let us assume courant stability satisfied ok	test
audio_0_230148.wav	If there is a difference in flatness, then you can see there is a shift in the fringe patterns which is done	test
audio_0_220407.wav	So, we have a target and we want to introduce u to v	test
audio_0_82116.wav	Now, why it was close to 49	test
audio_0_59507.wav	directed acyclic gra acyclic means no cycles	test
audio_0_47280.wav	So the mass fat, the gate voltage crosses the threshold, the MOSFIT starts entering into the linear region, this resistance starts decreasing	test
audio_0_84409.wav	Another one should be at the bottom	test
audio_0_117615.wav	so it is more that whether it is suitable for my organization, where i suitable for my personal dream need, etcetera	test
audio_0_174895.wav	slightly more obviously more complex than remember	test
audio_0_93718.wav	moreover, there are many situations where either you are trying to negotiate there also, you have to be a very good listener you have to look at the pros and cons of what has been said by one party or the other party when you invite a bid or when you call several people	test
audio_0_190107.wav	So, you can think of this as a polynomial with integer coefficients and let us say g is 7 x power 6 minus 8 x power 5 plus 5 x squared minus 8 ok	test
audio_0_60892.wav	here f is not moving, but d, e have moved	test
audio_0_117211.wav	so here what we have: have a large geographical space, why, which is different into regions and which has, say, for wireless sensor network and if there is a aggregated ah, some processing is required, then these are switched on and give a aggregated view on the things	test
audio_0_173230.wav	So both disciplinary and professional requirements are important for a graduating engineer	test
audio_0_46322.wav	Of course there is one major problem with this R	test
audio_0_130183.wav	so we have to take good care and we have to be careful	test
audio_0_184231.wav	Now what about interference	test
audio_0_99945.wav	So, if this assignment has to happen, if this assignment has to take place, then some A star object as to get cast to B star which happens to be a downcast	test
audio_0_58181.wav	this is sometimes called re budgeting	test
audio_0_147669.wav	And after it starts to look stabilized, click on stop	test
audio_0_202232.wav	To do that what we have to do, after clicking ok, now again click mate, command pick one of the surface	test
audio_0_139088.wav	To, you know, come to a compromise between these we could	test
audio_0_11840.wav	Now, we will start for your AC circuit	test
audio_0_146025.wav	So, there is again a context switch	test
audio_0_53422.wav	b reflected is equal to b transmitted	test
audio_0_219557.wav	So, you do not need this table at all even to compute back the witness for the given numerical solution	test
audio_0_94229.wav	they will try to prove their mettle by bringing logic, by a bringing a say, arguments, by bringing ideas which go against	test
audio_0_18431.wav	That means, if you in AC circuit, you basically, we will term with impedance	test
audio_0_212155.wav	and this is v ref, and you can see this is a quite simple to do	test
audio_0_46468.wav	That is one rating which you can have for the diode	test
audio_0_151491.wav	3 comments are there for post, where as likes is about 9 likes, only citizens is about 3	test
