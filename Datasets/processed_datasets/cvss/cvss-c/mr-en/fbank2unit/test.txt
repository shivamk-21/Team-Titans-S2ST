so, now you have got vth as well as zth
so, anything that was printed other than by this company would be regarded as an infringing work or that will be regarded as something that was done without authorisation
now, this was repealed from the criminal laws; when the trademarks act, 1958 was enacted and we had a special regime the provision which criminalized unauthorized use of marks was removed from the criminal statutes and it was now a part of a separate act in itself
if you substitute all the values i infinity i 0 and tau you will get i t is equal to 2 minus e to the power minus 2 t ampere right
so, when we have the number in memory if it is an int, then the entire string is just considered to be one value where as if we have block of digits which represents a float
we have discussed three examples particularly of complex numbers; of rectangle objects with points and of a stack
so, if you apply this and this is the connection then it will be forced to connect to this particular point and your circuit would be like this
the next emf is like this; the third emf is like this
so, here thevenin’s initially when first time those who are studying first time for them just you have to be very care full that how you do it and how you can get it right
so now if we see the specification for design of splices we can see that when the ends of the compression members are faced for complete bearing over the whole area these should be spliced to hold the connected members accurately in position and to resist any tension when bending is present
we divide it by the characteristic polynomial of the l f s r and after all the bit patterns are fed whatever remains in the l f s r, that is the signature, that is the reminder after division and that reminder we are calling as this signature
although no rhymes and jingles are mostly verbal you can think of a visual and auditory formats of rhymes and jingles
so will there be an induction in the stator if i have a current flowing in the rotor
so, the quick brown, the first line end with the backslash n, fox end with backslash n and then over and above that if you remember the print statement adds a backslash n of its own
so, we have to rotate that object in such a way that; when i visualize that object, these edges supposed to make 120 degrees
so, first we will see what is the force current analogy
in the partial reporting condition, the participant was basically supposed to identify the subset of the character within the visual display and it was realized that memory was better in this case
we saw that an entry will take time proportional to it is distance from the diagonal
so, if we have french curves, one can smoothly construct a nice line which is passing through that c p 4 p 5 and b
so, init is what is called a constructor
so, no current is flowing here also and this is closed right
so here i am showing a metal line in between
let's take this magnet with a small magnetic moment and put it through this tube channel
if this profile plane makes an angle beta with the horizontal plane, we called auxiliary inclined plane
you talk about the wheat floor
in that list, there will be a category of executive and non executive directors
the twos cancelled off
and at that time we told that this response is nothing but the natural response of the circuit
welcome to part 2 of module 10
y coordinate ok
so you have to make a good estimate on the length of the interconnections, for which some interconnection topologies may have to be assumed
so, part c, we want to calculate δn 1 millisecond later
so, once again for low frequency it will oscillate plus 0 like that and at high frequency as frequency increases plus minus plus minus plus minus very fast plus minus plus minus plus minus only a vibration and then no movement at all
after solving i 3 is equal to 1
if we connect this net to three and this net to one
this is a convention which the designer tries to follow so that the capacitive effect is minimized
first when to use a technology tool at all
this is where we left of from our last class
so, what about that side with vertical plane if it is making naturally any angle making with vertical plane we will see it in the horizontal plane
if we want to mark these construction lines, drop down these vertical lines and mark by arrows 70, and the other inclination is this is 60 degrees
this is my armature and this is the field and field is being separately excited
in the next couple of slides, we will quickly take look into different examples of lifetime and try to understand this better
if the required clearance between the conductors and the water midway between the tower is 45 meter and if both the towers are on the same side of the point of maximum sag, find the tension in the conductor the weight of the conductor is given 0
so, when you when you are asked to find the laplace transform you will use the expression for conversion of laplace transform that is laplace of ut is nothing but integration between 0 minus to infinity 1 into e to the power minus st dt
i hope you understand because hysteresis will always talk about some amount of remnant flux density
now, what is that again
so, the circuit for this wilkinson power divider is like this
so, this incident is actually a scattered field only and if this a boundary condition was perfect, there should not be any reflected field
we set the standards for both
suppose our direction of propagation is along the +z direction and x and y are the other coordinate axis, then in tem waves, we have ez equal to hz equal to 0
the point that is of interest is here and that is called vc
then what will happen
maybe i will just check autism in the next session, but let us look at the way problems handle
so, here also you can advance or delay
here we have a block and cylinders, something like a cylinder and there is a block, that block we can see it in the top view it is something like a rectangular block, there is a circle
so, let us just see this side first; , left side first
now we come to the liabilities and capital
1700 is the 85% of some value and what could be that value you can easily find out that that value is 2000 that value is going to be 2000 because 2000 and into how much is the waste is 15% divided by 100 so this works out as how much this is 15% so
that is what we have shown at this point
so that was our assumption
so, let's keep that in mind and use this as a basis for the formulations
i am assuming that there is an h between every pair of vertices, so every connection is possible
there is no specific order that you can get from this
so, its value is let us say 1 over here and at x 2 e
so, if you calculate this, so for this calculating the rate, standard rate, we will have to do some adjustments, some updations or some upscaling of the standards
one particular point i had forgotten which i have to mention in the next class as to why the wattmeter reading in no load test represents only iron losses, why the wattmeter reading in the short circuit test represents only i square r losses or copper losses, why not the other way around, okay
so, far we have covered detailed discussion on financial statements, balance sheet, p&l as well as cash flow
therefore, what becomes important if you are actually going to make rigorous calculations on capacities which the code does not require but if you were to design something which is not a simple confined masonry construction you will have to make calculations, you may have to make ultimate capacity checks and any model that you look into must have the interaction effects of the unreinforced masonry wall panel with the confining elements and there is a body of literature particularly coming from eastern europe works by tomazevich and group in zagreb and also from south america on analytical approaches for understanding the lateral load behavior, strength and deformation capacity of confined masonry constructions is available and you can we are also looking at a couple of such works to understand the in plane flexual capacity and the in plane shear strength of confined masonry constructions
then plus your it will be 6 into i i 3, because current through this branch is i 3 is equal to 0
1 is sine omega t plus 180 degree
now let us see the significance and use of this test method
that means that there is no time factor coming in this particular expression
then finally, we look at 14 and find that 14 does not appears so we skip it
because it is a copyright issue, so mostly we do not get it but… yes mostly we do not get it
what other items
so, for a dc problem what is the you know you have a charge and you want to find out voltage that is your dc problem
now, i was going to play a specific sports because of my keen interest in that, i was not interested whether i would become a great player or anything like that, but then the object of my joy is now converted into a mechanism
notions of universality were initially suggested by ekman and friesen and later on there had been a large critical support for them
e2 is 30 millisecond period is 150 and e3 is 60 millisecond and p3 is 200 millisecond
now, v o is already negative ok; so this is minus v supply
so you can take it out
now one way we can do that is again you know you take a compass with the origin of the gamma plane as the center and draw an arc till you are crossing the r equal to 1 circle
so, if in the case of voltage source, we have to sort it; if you do so, now what will happen now as soon as suppose this current is ah suppose this current say i 0 this current is i 0 right
so, this will go up this is going down this is going up
as we go from mobile to smart phone we find yet some more functionalities coming in and in that way the phones form a very nice small specialization generalization hierarchy
f at x is equal to zero, to the function of time t here
now, certainly we cannot explain all of this right here
when it is called, i have actual parameters
so, you can see that d r is a cosine of theta, so i can write this small volume element as r square d cosine of theta d phi times a cosine of theta
now this factor is directly dependent on the aspect ratio of the wall, h being the height of the wall and l being the length of the wall
now, another 1 case is bc is equal to your 11500 volts, in that case this is v 2, this is 1 possible connection
so, finally means after balancing everything, after recording for all the say opening balance of the cash, closing balance of the cash, making the payments, then going for the collections from the sales, everything when we prepare the cash budget for the three months here for the quarter
for the triangular taper we get the lowest height of the ripples but we also get the lowest bandwidth and klopfenstein taper is somewhere between the two
purely normal right; so, that purely normal will this dot product with this whole expression over will end up being 0
in the second which is a parallel gaze it’s a recalling a sound gaze
and then finally i will get 81
so, this performance evaluation of the different products by a firm, about all the products being manufactured by the firm, the decisions can be taken and the marginal costing is very, very helpful
that is the purpose of the budgeting
one principle which is very important is the affordance principle which tells you what is to be clicked and when
so, the grid is let me use a different color the grade is this, this is still the grid i am considering
ok, now here when you do routing, you may also land up in something called a wiring congestions
so, this boundary condition will not be strictly true because there are more fields over here
do you remember what is interim dividend
we raise money by way of shares
that is what we are taking as the inductance
then if we now have a system where we can use this error, where we can you know remove this error, so to do that what we do is this output signal is now subtracted from its own version using a delay, so as to account for this delay of this amplifier
so, this redistribution is something that is not going to be considered in your, in the expressions or the failure plane itself
edf, we saw that it is the optimal algorithm, there can be no other algorithm which can schedule a set of tasks if edf cannot
you assume shear deformation profile or a cantilever deformation profile, you will be able to establish what is the elastic stiffness, lateral stiffness of this wall
so, that was step 1
so, we a denote the two inputs with plus and minus symbol and we call them as a inverting and non inverting inputs minus for inverting plus for non inverting inputs ok, you can also call for simplicity plus input minus input ok
now to find the vth, what we will do will find the value of voltage across the terminal a b
we insert into the tree all these values and now we are print t give me a sorted version of this
no the u 2 two enough this two refers to left or right
but in this group, we look at the two people are standing with certain closeness in comparison to the third person and the third person who is slightly isolated in comparison to others is also showing his isolation with the help of other body linguistic signs
and this series resistance is known to me
so, third part means let us use our protractor 30 degrees, again 60 degrees and 90 degrees
and then we can write i do you want it on or you want it off
8 right, then minus terminal encountering first, then minus v o c is equal to 0 hope i have not missed any term
so that is why this circuit is drawn analogous to your say dc circuit say this is analogous to dc circuit so, your phi is equal to f m upon reluctance
we can have heating coils and we can have the silicon rod to push the wafer further inside the furnace
and, you can work through the math you will get an answer 4 in this case also
so, that is p into l
therefore you you have to again series means it is like a your find equivalence in parallel, for same way for series one you have to make it for capacitor
so, what is del
one interesting application of the smith chart is to read impedances and impedance transformation
so, we do not see anything depth and this one follows that one
so let us now let us take one example to understand what we discussed related to energy stored in the coupled circuit
now, this is a circular ring so, what we will do is we will take your what you call that you are mean path, this is actually mean flux path, we will take the mean distance right
so, this i this is this is actually i x and this is actually v by 50; that means, in this expression you put also 3 by 2 into v by 50, then we will get the solution for v
so, next one you look
it is interesting that this smart mass scale reading of body language uses the same metaphor design; uses the same metaphor the same design, which had been used in the 19th century
you could just use reference
so, you are the person, who is looking at the monitor and the object is slightly inclined with you
c and just specify that s is equal to 60
but unfortunately neither could sir humphry davy solve this problem and neither could mr
so that means torque will be in all probability a function of both stator current and rotor current
lets say a four input and gate
if i want to increase the gain, right
then these partial derivatives will have different dimensions, that is all that is there to it
the next part is to use this vulnerability to inject malicious code into that particular application
2, 66 – 6
the width of the depletion region is inversely proportional to the concentration of the carriers
now what is so special about this range of frequencies
if two people are already engross in the dialogue and the third person wants to participate in it, the two people who are already in the dialogue have to move in such a position that the third person feels invited
the open circuited winding will be hv winding, whereas this will be lv winding, lv corresponds to low voltage winding, the other one is high voltage winding
otherwise we will use minus n
00979 per unit megawatt and if you take up to 7 decimal places a bracket i made it it is minus 0
but, you can see that this is where our observations were going in
ok, the last example that i take here is with respect to designing memory
so, just to be even more explicit, this is what i made
this shine and a sparkle allows the interviewer to think that what you are talking about is actually an aspect in which you are interested and at the same time you are revealing and information of which you are proud
we are not going into the derivation of why this is required, but you can just take it as a statement of fact
so, when you plot a shot noise against frequency you will find it has a constant value ok
05 mm
that means if there is an electromagnetic plane, electromagnetic wave going in some direction, in the same direction, per unit area, per unit time, the energy that flows is one half square root of epsilon zero and mu zero e zero square
so, 4 into i 2 minus i 1 and i told you earlier i 1 is equal to 2 ampere
so, in the last week we discussed about two very important theorems those were superposition theorem as well as thevenin's theorem
so in the next lecture we will start our discussion with the delta wye connected circuit or delta star connected circuit
sputtering is another way of depositing the atoms on the substrate, it is a more of mechanical way we will see what exactly is sputtering does and how the system looks like that is our understanding this we are not really looking at the physics behind how these things are done alright, because there is not scope of our course scope is that we understand that these are the techniques that we can use in the process alright
unless this is being retained the purpose will not be achieved of having a model which is close enough
the transconductance here is smaller than this and so on
the applications that we will be showing can be run using both arduino uno board as well as stm board
so in electromagnetic waves falling on steam in where get absorbs, apply the pressure equal to energy density
now, once we know this which is our theory part which we have kind of repeated, right
the second equivalence theorem is called the surface equivalence principle ok
using zero gravity simulator, which the simplest of all is called a clinostat
next would be editing
so if i take my fingers around, l clockwise or counterclockwise thumb gives me the direction of a
for steel these values are much lesser because it's a material which is not affected so much by variability but for materials like masonry and concrete fy by fs is a significant number and cannot be neglected
so, we often see in the small towns that people who are there at 40, 50 are actually taking care of not only their parents, but parents of their friends and everybody
and this is your what you call say this is my v a, b and c
when i tell parents that the kid is actually if you want a term for it, is undergoing emotional disorder which is depression, this is how can be depressed, how does a kid does, he internalizes it and it becomes aggressive or all that jumpiness
at the same time, we interpret the smiles, and at the same time we also become conscious if the smiles are absent
lists are mutable values we can go and change values at given position without affecting the name in the rest of the list
we have revised the concepts of fundamental concepts in c; variables, data types, literals, control constructs
now as time progressed and memories became more and more complex it was required to actually scale down and have more dense memories
that is what happens whether it is a generator or motor
the easiest polygon what i can really fix is something like a tail, a rectangular tail i can put maybe a rhombus i can really construct or perhaps a triangle i can really construct
now this feedback connection are the structure of this l f s r can be defined by something called the characteristic polynomial, like this: particular for for l f s r is represented or characterized by this polynomial
so, i have lay down and noted down other things which is the factors do for the firms, for the manufacturing sector firms which you can go through here they are self explanatory
and after that once we go from here to this point, we have to come back to this point at the origin
thisese isare another exercise that when we are when we are learning, when we are understanding something; now our focus should be completely on what we are learning and not to other things
that will be my v in; that means, this much voltage at the input i have to apply to make my output 0, easy right
i cannot call f2 by f 5
mark alexander: i may not be here for that much long but to see what the future holds that i think that this material concrete is just absolutely essential to modern life, to development of the planet
if you want to process a dictionary then we would need to run through all the values; and one way to run through value all the values is to extract the keys and extract each value by turn
exactly; so, just like in the case of the current discussion if i had a volume charge distribution a charge that is distributed through the volume then what will happen is the finite charge residing in a volume that is shrinking to 0; so its contribution will be negligible
so there are several indian codes and specifications that look at concrete design, of course if you look at the list of codes inspects it is massive specification for concrete construction with ias, with irc, with irs, with most and then there are guidelines and specifications drawn up by various metro construction projects and highway construction projects and so on
then life is good and everything is consistent
similarly, we kind of print lot of things using the screen printing technology and this is thick film
from circuits you may find that you need one thousand test vectors
so, ob dash is equal to l minus x 1 is equal to 250 minus of minus 123
so, they are looking mainly at what we will see later is the most important process which is the clinkering which has the most impact
so that’s the assumption i have, okay
so, once you have the basic compressive stress, you need to check if permissible compressive stress in compression can be augmented, particularly if you have a condition of eccentricity, significant eccentricity above 1 in 24, you will apply an increase in the permissible compressive stress
suppose if i if the current is flowing in this direction, which may possibly create flux, say from left to right
now x in, that is the input reactance of this gap coupled resonator is equal to
how the output resistance will behave with respect to ambient temperature
but for arbitrarily relative deadlines where the deadline may be different from the period, they may produce different schedules
if we just quickly compare it with the polymeric c++ solution this was basic approach to the solution and this was a solution
standard cost of revised standard cost of revised standard composition minus standard cost of standard cost of actual labor composition
so in the previous slide we looked at what goes into making a unit mass of clinker
i have question about telestration
we have sold how many units in the market
it is only driving the buffers, not the capacitive loads
so, the relationship for an in this is non invert originally it was non inverting amplifier
so this is how the top down estimation this works
sir in the corner region will there be exactly a lossy medium
this is global routing
i would base my initial discussions over this concept on the findings of edward t hall
now this is when circuits start becoming apparently more complex and difficult
similarly, each and every point mapped there a point, e point, d to d, c to c, b to b points, this is the way we connect these maps
k will remain
these tips may help us in overcoming the negative aspects related with our body language
and this is basically our output voltage which is also a perfect sinusoid, so this is the class a operation
now, so to measure this current i have to insert a pmmc meter
it has got this is 5 volt, ground, and this is the tx and this is the rx
because in most of the power electronics and most the dcdc converters, the central figure, the central component is not only the power semiconductor device, but more, in fact, the magnetic components components that is the transformers and the inductor so you have to pay a lot of attention to that and try to see if you can scale scale up your skills in trying to make the transformers and these inductors so with that i will close this topic or this course and probably meet you in future again in some other course
we are removing that part, and we are now concerned about the exact sms
is a relation between the magnitude of e and the magnitude of h right there is a eta
now, these three types of frictions which we have just discussed are considered to be the practical model that has been devised to describe the frictional phenomena which we find in the physical systems
so there might be a maximum gain gt max and all other gain will be lesser than gt max other possible is that say a particular gamma s which gives lowest noise or optimum noise as we call it or say it might give the maximum linearity
so, make sure that you know you are aware as the leader or as one of the members of your team
now, in case of a point dipole placed in free space, we know divergence of b equal to zero and curl of b is equal to mu zero j
similarly comes the hold time, which is denoted by t hold or t h, t hold
so, inventory, knowing the inventory, status of inventory, how much inventory is already there, how much inventory we want to keep even at the end of the quarter in question, finally we have to decide that what is the requirement for the current period
so, what is the design process that we follow in industry when you have to create any learner content
so, in last class we looked at semiconductors and how a bind gap evolves in them
so, project that and based on this origin transfer this length or radius in this direction to get point a
now, 20 kva is given as 20 kva is given as the rating of the transformer, how much is the current on this side
so i have: e is equal to e zero sine of k x minus omega t and b equals b zero sine of k x minus omega t
so if i take something with constant potential surface close surface, constant potential over the surface then field inside will zero
so almost all the blocks in a design that you want to layout on a vlsi chip will be requiring the power and ground connections
so, connect e 1 to e' by dashed lines
the output of and gate will be one if both are one
so, it is very difficult to read resistances values which are very of very high value ok
there should be a reference dimension, something like this is 95 units from the object from this center to this one is 95
they were recommended to the central government ministry of finance that this type of the concession should be withdrawn
so, the symbol of a schmitt trigger is like this like op amp and inside the op amp you draw a hysteresis band or a hysteresis loop like a b h curve ok
whereas this current is still i so the total current that is carried by the brush is still i plus i minus i plus small i so it is 2i still that is not going to change but the problem with this coil is it is not very sure whether it is carrying the current in one direction or the other, that is the problem
and in this process the independent sources in the circuit are shorted
if i have three errors for example, if i have an index error and a name error and a zero division error then, what will happen is that, it will first go here and find that there is an index error
in that way, we will in that way we will construct points p1, p2, p3 in the bottom view also
i think we should also, because of the way the admin would be handling this content, we should always have like parallel content being saved all the time because if i have to go to some point in the past and see what the structure of the note was at that point of time, so that i can come and edit or remove whatever it was, then the past content should always be available with the admin to ensure that the content is
so, it means what is the standard cost of standard mix is the 6800s and we have already calculated and the net standard output
i will just repeat again
and once we have that then with that object, we can use the data member, the data member here is top using the dot member notation
so, i have to remember that if i am using a row vector and a matrix by name of the function has to be multiplied underscore vr underscore m or something similar that is whereas if i am doing multiplication of a row vector by a column vector, then the name of the function has to be something different vrvc
so, if we can just recall we have taken a look into the const ness of values and variables which is critical in terms of a getting read of manifest constants being able to maintain better type all through the c++
in figure 51, the switch has been closed right for a long time and it open at t is equal to 0
so this, if we just look at the property of this x, this will shift to three because at three, definitely both of them are at zero
so, the way we will be going about discussing these components is based on the number of oats each component has
that is how we are applying or we are using thermal energy to evaporate the material cool alright excellent
now i am hundred percent sure that you guys know what is a semiconductor, what is conductor, and what is insulator
the unorganized sector uses molds and casts bricks
that is the rent payment is or the payment for the rent is 8050
and i am substituting this value here, what i get isé now we should know that this is not always possible, we cannot always have conversion from the for a domain to the laplace domain using this transformation
weights
so you need some kind of a buffer, either a current buffer which can be fit to a number of different clock points, or you can have a some kind of a network of buffers like this, so from here you can possibly feed
to simplify things, the rectangular stress block is something that is acceptable for which you need the equivalent stress block dimensions and here the equivalent stress block is a factor k that's multiplied into the ultimate strength in compression, fu is the ultimate strength and compression of the masonry
first of all i am undoing it, so that this object can be easily moving
but, it has to be done in a very conscious manner; otherwise the other person may feel insulted
so, if you take the first figure, normally we expect an increase, i have deliberately taken a company where there is a decrease
researchers have pointed out some very interesting habits and preferences in this context
so, what is this, what should i write for this arrow
so, this node at the bottom right must be deleted because the structural property of the heap says that we must fill the tree left to right, top to bottom
you repeat this process for every pair of vertices and see at every step which pair gives you the best benefit or gain
so that is 3, third step of the activity, anything more a student would be carrying out while studying at home
i hope you are able to solve it
so, it will there
so, we will put it as na and don't include it for the total purposes
i assume that you all know this where at the call site, the example is here
thats why here i am writing, assuming that ajj is equal to p, m two, r jj plus qm two, xjj minus point five, vm one square
given a set of cells v in a set of nets e, we define x, v, y v to be the center of a cell v, there should be belongs to see this symbol has not come small v belongs to capital v
so for a clock is concerned, but for ah for power routing, with vdd and ground
we are almost at the end of the course
so l f is recomputed
but if you put a thin layer of chrome and then deposit gold it will stick properly
so delta v means change in voltage across this point zero
place it in between its jaw and just press it
so rule of the thumb is that if a signally coming later, you assign it to an input pin which is faster at first
here we have to write r2 dash by 2s and here we have to write r2 dash by 2 into 2 minus s
the extended blinking suggest that the brain does not want to tolerate dealing with the other person who is talking or the person is not interested in the content at all finds it extremely painful
and if you have an query you can ask, if you have an query feel free to ask
in this circuit if you see the circuit we want to find out the thevenin equivalent but in this particular circuit we do not have any independent voltage or current source, so the circuit would have only dependent source
do it like this: you add both dividing plus differentiation factors, so you are parallely, giving them both the signal, say for zero to five days or for four to five days, ok
so, now i hope that we know most of the components are discrete components
there are other things also there
so, dividing the whole flexible budget into the different departments, sub departments, units and subunits is not, means is very much desirable and though it is going to take some more time but it is very much desirable is very much useful because it will support all your entire say the manufacturing process as well as the comparison between the budgeted and the actual performance
so, i will indicate it like this and this was surrounded in a bigger region i call this boundary s infinity the source s and there was some current source over here j
so, when you are going for new versions, new updates will be there for the software still the older versions work for practicing the simple engineering drawing problems
we do not know whether it is a true pentagon or not
so, again, you have got long term liability, short term liabilities
this will be valid for a function i can have a default value like 2 plus 3 what their compiler will do it will compute 2 plus 3 while it is compiling and it is said that default value as 5
measure from s dash to v, use the same length; mark other point t dash, join t dash and a new point
question number two: we have a uniformly charged spherical shell
so, it is actually compensating some of the reactive load at the your what you call at the receiving end
so, the change in conductivity will be more or less driven by this excess whole concentration
for example let us say that we have operating system specific data present in this specific row
when there is objective or there no object
employees are issued shares either as free or at a discount which they can convert into equity shares
from that center if we are measuring the radius we usually go with that
now see, it is printing 1
if you recall the previous equation was a equation only in electric field
suppose annual energy saving that is beyond the scope of this course, because it will consume lot of time and at the same time you need the help of computer without writing code it is not possible to actually explain that how things are, but ah, but we will see that ah how the energy ah saving is possible using your sand capacitor it is not only that that if you if you design sand capacitor in a distribution system in such a fashion such that ah i mean; if you can plan that ah you that all the all the reactive powers that actually load requires plus the reactive power losses in the ah distribution network
u 1 will appear and
so l a will contain only those faults with change, the value of a, which means only a stuck at one right
this is the purpose of the function declaration or the function header
so, if you make average power for inductive circuit 1 by t 0 to t p dt, it will find 0 because, there is no resistor here
so, in the case of gate oxide, we should go for dry oxidation, whereas for field oxide or masking oxides, we can use the wet oxidation
so; that means, insulation level expressed in impulse crest peak or peak value, which is standard wave not longer than this one, i mean 1
and then similarly i have a e transmitted again the way the plane should be the same, this is the transmitted wave
so, with that we conclude the course and that was the last module and the last part of the module on special topics looking at assessment of mason reconstructions
so, storage department can be the one department which can be the one independent center
so, using the relationship, you have ah you have to it is written that if that is asked to derive this right
i will expose this wafer with uv light; expose this wafer with uv light, alright
this is your basic r box
so, i am going to have a potential divider, which is actually connected to a dc source and i am going to have this ammeter connected here and this is going to be connected with the help of a jockey point right
we can also have permanent magnets rather than having winding, i can also have a real magnetic which is naturally available, i can try to make a magnet properly shaped and i can put it in rotor structure, in which case i do not have to really depend upon any winding for the excitation
so, if you simplify it will become 31 v 1 minus 15 v 2 minus 10 v 3 is equal to 2 40
so, ultimately, i have to scale everything to get the hysteresis loss
so, how to design using the operating power circle
it converts this recursion into a kind of iterative process, where you fill up the values that you would normally fill up in the mem table by recursion to fill them up iteratively starting with the ones which have no dependencies
so, in figure 42, switch s 1 has been closed for long time
then as you compile, you may compile through an ide
so, we start with the empty list of factors of n for every j in for this range if it divides we append it
but mechanically it is weaker, mechanical it is weaker that is what he is saying hhence the limiting range of such oscillators would be 200 hertz to 300 kilo hertz or 200 hertz or 300 kilo hertz
and then it gives you the rule to compute it
so, that is where cem comes to the rescue right so, cem we calculate j
so this also will give me per unit resistance, i thing one of the problems gave this, at rated condition, the ohmic losses, where so much percentage of the overall kva rating it was given, the rated copper losses where 5 percent, 2 percent of the rated kva, that means essentially r equivalent is 2 percent
you may have posted on a discussion board or a chat forum
so the property of distinct numbering also holds for this
5 ampere and i am essentially getting a wattage reading of 1600 watts and when it is freely running let us say it is running close to a speed of 1800 rpm let us say 1760 rpm
normally we draw circuits with the ground as the bottom rail and that's what i'm going to do for this as well
and the blue once here the dynamic cast operator and the typeid operator is what we discussed
so it is greater than equal to 0 and it is strictly lesser the length of l
also the maximum spacing of horizontal and vertical reinforcement should be the lesser of the shear wall length or one third of the shear wall height or 1
so, it will be i 1 minus i 2, right
this must be familiar to you from regular circuit analysis
income is of two types
so let us understand what we have done in these demonstrations
remember we are not talking about the passage of genes from parents to children rather we are talking about the trait
so, when we go through each of the phases of the addie process now, we will discuss the key questions that each of us has to keep in mind as we design learner centric e content
again there are prescriptions given as to what should be the size of the second unit and that's h2
he had used this word in 1963 publication of his book with a title, the hidden dimension
so if i can find ah path in the circuit such that this property is true, then you consider that's path together at a time
for mosfet you can see very clearly 1 2 3 4; 4 mask
again, these are the characteristics of an operational amplifier
the entry for a function in the plt comprises of these three statements, first there is an indirect jump
you have also seen what is virtual short; very important parameter virtual short
our payments are more by $15,400 as against the receipts
so, i have my update equations in the variables of my choice plus one term over here which i can interpret as a current, but it is coming exactly as the value of incident field over here
we know i 2 by a is equal to i 2 dash therefore, this i 2 denominator you multiply by a again
so, that is why that is why this circuit this circuit is like this is actually mechanical output right
so, r prime which is this point over here stays in v 2
so, this is just a fact that we will have to take it and go back and read this part
so, this structure that kind of connects a coaxial cable of this width to a coaxial cable of this inner width, this is that discontinuity
in one hour of how much is output
stopping corrosion was measured by the depolarized potential getting to 150 milli volts, 150 milli volts with respect to calomel electrode
that since the deformable heights could be different because of the sizes of the openings, the deformable length that you see in this next figure here, the deformable length of the frame element could be different
so, n r and r is equal to your b by 2
so, for gallium arsenide, the absorption coefficient mu is given, so μ is 5 x 105 cm 1
you may have coal handling plant which will have n number of drives maybe in pulverizing the coal, transporting the coal through the conveyor belt and so on and so forth, all of them need to be energized, all of them need power so that power might come from the tertiary winding of your generator or power transformer itself
problem 4 is also related to a solar cell
so, this is my maximum frequency and this fixes indirectly this fixes delta x right
for the top view the rectangle has to make 30 degrees equal angles on both sides
from these things we have to eliminate i1, i2 and v1
on the other hand if i look at the is operation then list1 list2 is list3 happens to be true, because we have seen that this assignment will not copy the list it will just make list3 point to the same thing is list2
in this case you can use the word pass in order to do nothing
so, because it is 10 into delta t minus strength is 10, right
although it is not energy efficient, it is not really allowing you to save energy, it is only dissipating the energy in the resistance
here i mentioned verification guarantees and here i said testing tries to guarantee, because, as i have just now said, using testing you can never guarantee hundred percent free from faults or failures
so, what are those pins
so the privileged instructions essentially should be used as a super user where you have instructions to create pages, add pages extend pages, remove enclave, and create an enclave and so on
so, at this moment we may need to reset the counter
welcome back, just now it is told about star delta transformation not delta transformation right
the adxl 355 is a small, thin, and low power 3 axis accelerometer with signal condition voltage output
now, in the last session we had seen that this profit which is plowed back is a reserve
that means at the end of three months, you have to pay one fourth of 10,000 or say 2,500
so, its like i have one valley over here right
so, this is what you get the value of xs
so the operation is pretty simple here
so, this balance sheet you will prepare by taking the balances from the previous balance sheet
and, if v 2 is positive output is also going to be positive, that is why it is called non inverting ok
now, certainly the first thing that we see is this is a p b points to a
so, i should not be trying to write update equations for scattered field
then we will consider one more transformer which is chebyshev, so let us see what is a chebyshev
you heard the word divergent, divergence means we say views are diverging, there is diverging light rays coming
so aggressor is the wire on which signal transition is occurring and victim is the wire on which the noise is is getting coupled
in that case those pin numbers we can refer to as a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5
this is the jack, what you see at the center is the jack but on either sides of the jack, on the two sides of this of where the jack is the jack is actually fixed onto a central brick unit where the red dot is is one brick unit
because it is a standard practice, then whatever the closing stock you keep, you keep from the current years or current periods production, not from the previous period production
793, but it just match right
so, a n, b n, c n, we call we will come to that we call it is a phase voltage
consequently, the potential v one r goes to v two r, which is v one r plus f rho two minus rho one, through this f, which is between zero and one
expected standard cost that after adjusting for everything as for the current time or the current situation or the current scenario in the market, what is the expected cost of production that is called as the finally standard cost
in these situations, it is advisable to engage the whole body open the whole body towards the audience turn in such a manner towards the audience that the person feels that you are actually turning to look at the person listen to the question, which is being asked and then answering to that
that means, because this q c is coming from the shunt capacitor all the total is q l right; without without considering any loss and this is the power triangle
any idea, what is windage
now, to determine the energy stored in magnetically coupled coil, let us consider the following circuit
for example, the dot text section, these two columns specify the offset and the size for the various sections present in the object file
or the snake that cross in my mind
then, if you have a call with just 2 arguments, then, this will be associated with a and b, and so, this will be interpreted as f 13, 12, and for the missing argument c and d, you get the defaults 14 and 22
all of you guys know that if machines are not there, we are not going to be able to get any electricity and you know that literally we are our you know it is as good as breathing, electricity
litv labor idle time variance
regarding dimensions when we are showing, dimension lines and extension lines; these shall be on the same plane
so, you have an act, which is done by parties, which is what we refer to as interaction
now see, in typical wheel is a physical design
now, once this is done, we take every routing regions, one at a time, and try to complete the exact inter connection patterns to route that particular routing region
38 times 10 to the minus 23 joules per kelvin
so, most of the drawings what you work on this area graphics area what we call will consist of triad
if you try to display a dictionary in python, it will show it to you in this bracket in this kind of curly bracket notation, where each entry will be the key followed by the values separated by the colon and then this will be like a list separated by commas
now, there are specialized objects like slots, something like you have a plumber blocks, maybe any mechanical device where you want to keep something like a plate with holes and other things that kind of things what we call slots
so, the axial stress ratio being low, you can get this special case of flexual mechanism which is flexible rocking
it is pointing to a new list constructed from that old list with a 9 appended to it at the end
the second thing i would represent this by is a resistance, so we are going to represent the ferromagnetic core by a resistance and inductance in parallel with each other
so, the plane is very, very fast when it lands
so, delta p l upon this p l delta p l p r it will become per unit that is why this and this, but this will remain hertz frequency will be hertz right; that means, unit of d will be per unit megawatt per hertz
all these things projected
now, somehow this means that if i do this and i must call that particular function appropriately which multiplies, post multiplies a square matrix with a column vector
so, in this case it will be move starting from here
so lets start by showing you some scripts on the producer side, ah, so, so lets take the first script which is on the producer side, and so let me move this
so, what we will do in this module
we connected a drain bias resistor rd and the current through this was id 0 whatever the operating point drain current of m1 is so the voltage across m1 is vdd minus id 0 times r d okay we have to make sure that this is more than vgs minus vg s minus v can use exactly the same technique here
so, this is my k z for a matched medium
so with this condition for our equilibrium we are neglecting the portion which is basically cracked and we are working on the partial section and in this partial section from the triangle the geometry of the triangle we get an expression of what is the compressed length of the wall in terms of the total width of the total thickness of the wall and the eccentricity of the load itself
so, let us start with the magic tee
so, based on the slice angle and location, we get different conic curves; that is a reason we call, from the cone
you just survive through the inertia through many years, but for reasons; known unknown we still do not know the cause all with there are many theories
so, it helps you establish what is the morphology of the cross section and then you can also look at the condition of the masonry, condition of the units and condition of the mortar
so coming back to our curve here, if the group velocity is constant, then there will be no distortion or dispersion between frequencies
now, let us take one another example in this case the node voltage needs to be determine but here the source is one is independent current source and second is the dependent current source
let me consider an example where we censored the drain and feedback to the source
another thing is that an intermediate point v 2 also it has been asked you find out right
so, when it had to do this conversion it has silently created another location, so p j actually
now, what we want to do is we want to extract this information
it because if you run a wire like this, it can unnecessary stop the other wires from coming in this area
so that also competes for your gypsum
so, on this side right side we have v p minus v n greater than 0 and on this side we have v p minus v n less than 0 this implies v p is greater than v n and, this implies v n greater than v p
so, what it does it simply implicitly converts the enum to int and adds by the operator of int
so, now as we have seen earlier the direction of current flow is conventionally taken as the direction of positive charge movement i told you, that current when you take the battery symbol plus minus form the plus the positive charge is flowing
and by ohms' law, by ohms law this current is a your clock clock wise we are taking this current actually i 1, it is entering into the positive terminal
so, you when you moving it , look i moving clock wise direct clock wise
it should be able to control the washing machine in a proper way, so that as a user you would be happy with the performance
so, it is coming see 646
so, we know that if in the same expression there is multiplication as well as addition; multiplication has to be done earlier wherever it occurs in the expression
so what we need to do is look for this text between the strings, so we want to split the column into lines into chunks between the commas and this is done using the split command
so when you want to connect them, you run a part on one layer, a part on other layer, so that this another connection that is going side by side does not intersect
before a person files for a design, the person can do a design search
understanding
similarly in this the edge is common to both elements
now, you have certain degree of authority invested in you, you are part of a law and enforcement agency which has invested great deal of authority; you can stop anybody, you can check anybody, you can examine somebody, you can take somebody in to custody, you can file case again somebody
so, this latch becomes 1; so this q bar becomes 0, as a result this transistor is turned off
now each signal here is the sum of signals flowing into it
so now let us see, ah these latches, how they can be implemented using mos technology, because in v l s i chips we normally do not implement flip flops like this using nand gates
in practice having a got table just like how we have done with data is quite time consuming
so we will come to this aspect
in our numerical example it was 3 volts and this appears across the gate and source of the mos transistor
so we are not unnecessarily allowing the input of the other block to toggle, because this will be use useless transition
so, we will choose the centre point axis so, what becomes like this again exaggerated drawing ok, so this is my observation point ok
in our next module we would look at kinesics as an independent part of nonverbal aspects of communication
if this is the mask here which is shown for the positive photoresist we will retain the same pattern
9689 legging
so, what is given as the voltages is 400 is the line voltage in star
i also know from gauss's law, which is true even in this dynamic situation, rho over epsilon zero, that e is going to be equal to sigma over epsilon zero between the plates and therefore d e d t is uniform
here i2 by i1 is also n1 by n2 because the 1 is going inside the dotted terminal other is coming out from the dotted terminal
if the power has a plus sign this is this is interesting this you have to understand; if the power has a plus sign power is been delivered to or absorbed by the element
so, whether i have manual, whether i have electric, whether i have petrol fluid and so on, instead of deriving this object jointly from two hierarchies i will derive it on one here on this particularly wheel side and then refer to the engine hierarchy as a member, as a composition
so we can write: b is also equal to zero
so let me just run qsim
so obviously, the current will be kind of interrupted and it will be forced to confine itself to only one particular stamping, i may call this as lamination or stamping
similarly you talk about any in the services sector have become very very strong now
so, the next mate available over here is width mate
and in this case, the drain is common to input and output
complex permittivity is one thing, but when i do complex permittivity the implicit assumption there is that i am going to i expand the fields as in the e to the j omega t form
so, once once you make this one and this right hand side actually we have made it to the what you call left hand side because will move from your what you call that your governor then your ah there is steam valve or governor then will move to the turbine then will move to the regenerator part right
now if i want to convert this sine wave, or if i want to apply a square wave instead of sine wave, then what is there
so what does this global routing problem or algorithm generates as output
now, similar to the spring, linear spring which we saw in case of translational motion, we can also define torsional spring
it is bent into a ring so that it becomes a torrid which is kept at center, at the origin
and, we have to wait before we can take the reading
so, this is just one choice ok
that should not change
in this case, we have already calculated b
if the width of the active region is comparable to de broglie wavelength, in that particular case we can get quantum confinement within the active region
so we will see that in the previous year we had the four quarters and in the four quarters over the different quarter first to fourth
so this circuit is the common source amplifier using current mirror bias
so, or if your search is particularly to enter a particular jurisdiction; say, a foreign filing then you would stipulate that you need to understand what is the patenting on this invention in a particular jurisdiction
then we say that we have an array of base pointers, so staff is a array of base pointers which is engineer and we put all these pointers there in the same order that we have done earlier
hard bake is done at 120 degrees and for 1 minute
so, this depends upon the material of the solar cell and also the kind of the dopants the concentration of the dopants, the width of the depletion regions and so on
because if sometimes while creating your files, version issues happened that is your earlier versions have been improvised, and that is why you have a latest version
so we see there are 3 loops now for each loop if we apply the kirchhoff's law then for i1 the current would be 4 ampere which is straight away you can see from the figure
only in the third category we could save some money where we paid actually the lesser rate as against the standard but as a net result because of increasing the number of weeks, because of changing the labor composition and because of paying the higher rate in the first two category of the workers your total labor cost variance has become negative or your labor cost has increased by a whopping sum of 13,000 rupees
so that is why what i will do is to have several number of conductors connected together
now, it is convenient to define a set of state variable and set equations to model the dynamic system
so, what you can what you can do this right
the actual resistivity or the conductivity depends upon the impurity level and also the crystalline state whether you have a single crystal or a poly crystal
we can also include short assessment questions, formative assessment questions in between the chunks where a learner can click a multiple choice question just like you did at the beginning of this learning dialogue
so you see, ah, when you design some chips which we except to cell in millions, for example the processor chips which intel manufactures, the pentiums, the multicore chips, cpu chips they are, they can effort to spend lot more time and effort in order to create a chip which is much better, much faster, much optimize
so if you see the particular condition in the a complex plane so sigma is varying in the at the x axis and g omega at the y axis
so, if i have to call function f3, then what is to happen
so for a general simo circuit, so any on transistoric and model as a resistance and some pull up and pull down network, any such things, you can model as ah r, c, r, c, r c kind of a ladder and there you can make a quite accurate estimate of the dealing
so, whenever a class is instantiated in terms of an object, the object will have the data members, and those data members we know can be accessed from the pointer of the object or from within the member functions of the object
so if suppose i apply zero, zero, so in presence of the fault coming is, lets say first, in the absence of the fault, the output will be vdd or high, because both the transistors will conducting and both the pulled down or off
so what do we total length
so, we will just work through this
we plug in delta sigma y into this expression from here and you get the final expression which is sigma a or b is the a of b is the average compressive stress under the action of both gravity forces and lateral forces as being the original pre compression in the wall sigma y plus or minus the shear stress into two times the geometry components delta x by delta y of the unit itself
you can substitute these values in this expression
i would first like to outline that when you talk about semantics of inheritance in c++, these are the first level items that you need to be very careful about
so short circuited line will have this kind of an input impedance
now the picture here i showed in most concrete structure what you see is if this is a pile you know coming out of water body you can see that the more corrosion is happening right where the pile comes out of the water body
so, that is why cross sectional area of flux we call it is a flux path at radius r, it will be 2 pi r l upon p; 2 pi r l is that your so we are assume this is cylindrical
so, now let us see
so there are implications
if i know the tangential field on a close control they act like
as an antenna designer if you are given these parameters right you do not know cem you have given the results of cem looking at this what will you say
power is nothing but time rate of expanding or absorbing the energy
again it has to be remembered that this needs to be true only around a certain operating point
it is common in sports people, it is also commonly visible in security forces and it is an impersonation of the toughness; the person wants to convey a mental toughness to the other person
and this gives me chi m plus one m equals chi m b over mu zero, or m is equal to chi m over chi m plus one b over mu zero
so why am i telling you this
i have i can see here sio 2 right you can see here sio 2 see why because there is a window created
so, therefore, the clearance between the conductor and the water level midway between the towers will be then 40 plus 14
and therefore what happens the nature and the nurture they act together to shape us an individual the way we look in our real life to others
so, this is the principle of pml the rest are all details
so, it's very different if you consider the condition of rigid diaphragm and estimate the shear forces coming onto the individual walls versus the situation of diaphragm flexibility
let us do that these steps on a graphical sheet
now this net list would translate in to physical domain where you do some kind of a chip level floor plant, like you decide that on your chip you can place your processor here, first memory here, second memory here, the i o, chips here
one more generally that is done is we try to make, we never make the core broader and thicker, we try to make them thinner and longer like this, i am sorry for the bad drawing, okay
37 ohm resistance have to be your what you call has to be in in inserted in that in that right
you have applied here where are the bias voltage bias voltage is here, you see the red pin and black pin in the center in the center red pin, right in green pin, right
now let's look at the inheritance clause
06 into 10 to the power 6 newton millimetre
so we are saying that the blocks connected to each other are suppose to exert attractive forces, just like as if they are connected by springs
so, you want what about maxwell’s equations in free space, no current, no sources, nothing right
but, you are not interested to specify how actually this funct function computes the result integer from the parameters x and y
so, we are going to have 1400 rpm when we were working at, you know 220 volts, now i am reducing it to 200 volts, when i reduce the voltage to 200 volts, va minus eb divided by ra is going to be the current
and in this case n is 2 so, this is accurate to order 3 my given function over here is a cubic polynomial
the question is what happens to z
so, this was an initial way by which when a trader or a seller of a goods when he had to have some kind of control over his goods, he would put a mark on it, so that marks could identify the owner
so remember, in this integral r is over the object either surface of volume and r prime is far away correct
so, next is you are determine the current through 10 ohm resistor of the circuit shown in figure 49 using thevenin’s theorem right
so, let us say you are sitting over here right, so this let us call this a top view and this is your let say this is a window and let us say there is a door over here and your mobile tower is somewhere over here right which is sending out signals everywhere
so, in this section, we will learn how to replace two terminal circuit containing resistances and sources by simply equivalent circuit that you have learned
we often use images with labels to represent facts and concepts
so, this is cutting edge science which is being learned along with an element of fun and competitiveness
i i will give you 20 seconds to understand what exactly you understand with this particular process flow
or if i draw it with the moss symbol i have vs and rs appearing across the gate source and rl appearing over here
so, i hope i see you in the next class and we will keep our journey on and we learn more with every class
so, i will just substituted over there and h is the unknown which in which i will replace the basis functions
we looked at as an extension of the manmuller criterion which works at the level of stresses, the extension which looks at resultant forces, and we have examined one of the criterion based on the flexual failure mechanism in the last class
so, string also is not a built in type, but it is a type added through the standard library and you will have to use the string header of c++ standard library to get the strings and it has some amazing behavior like being able to write concatenations of string as an addition expression
now, at a particular value this function value will be constant
so, consider the case of silicon, where we have 2 temperatures t 1 and t 2 and there are 2 intrinsic career concentrations n 1 and n 2
yeah, student, you can see that the number of lines here, each line is like one detection
so, in case of this e beam evaporation as only small source area is heated
now if you do plot this, what happens is in this region where the current is substantial, you will get approximately the same value
and such functions will be called quite naturally will be called member functions like re is a member of the class complex, we call it is a data member, similarly double norm this function is also a member of the class complex
but, this simpson’s rule tells you gives you one expression which is accurate to order second order
now at the receiving end means at the load end zp is given
and this is a evident in the example have given about the effect of background music in your content
similarly, when i am speaking, there is a pleasure wave that is going, but does not mean that air is moving from one side to the other
and we know that from normal kvl, kirchoffõs voltage low, at low frequencies or dc if a signal is applied, then the entire copperplate as long as it is a good conductor, entire copperplate will have the same voltage but that is not the case here because here the wavelength of the signal is comparable to the dimensions of the plate
now they have two options available, either to close down the business, pull the shutters and go out of the market
i do not need it i do not use it i just disconnected, always be safe, right
so, because it is 100 unit in length; so i would like to use same 100 units to make it like a l angular bracket
80 thousandths level of the sales and actual performance has gone up to 4 lakhs
and then finally, in the p side the concentration becomes equal to npo
this kind of a sensor can respond to gases like ammonia, sulphide, benzene and also alcohol and other harmful gases, but depending on the type of gas, how much change there will be in the output voltage will vary, it varies from gas to gas
because human mind does not blame in one line, it always has a possibility of contradiction
so, we will just say self dot value is none self dot left is none self dot right is none
in other word, just to take you a little bit to the molecular side of it, while we were discussing the muscle, i told you the muscles are made up of two key structural proteins: myosin and actin, or actin and myosin
now, those of you who have done course on special functions whatever in your math courses might recall what is called the bessel differential equation
look at other way: if there is a potential difference between two points on or in a conductor, this implies there will be a filled, because field is nothing but delta potential divided by the distance
so administrative overheads given to us are, for example, if you are given the administrative overheads here, 30,000s and selling and distribution overheads are given to us are, for example if you are given the administrative overheads here 30,000s and selling and distribution overheads are given to us are 20,000s, right
but again and again i will not write per unit then things will become clumsy; i do not want that, but equation 10 onwards, everything is in per unit and frequency of course, is in hertz, h will remain second, f 0 also will remain in hertz right, but this delta p g value delta delta p l value d all are in per unit right
4 you can but if i am going to give this to a ready mix concrete operator i am better off giving him number like this rather than telling him 26 and a half percent, 32 and a half percent because he is going to make mistakes
so, beyond this node any nodes are there it will not be affected
what is the effect
it will take a little bit more time
now, these are the takeaways from this particular coherence principle
58 kiloons is the worst case torsional shear for this wall
so, if you look into that; that your delta t is your differentiation of d u t by d t right
but i can't see how this performance report helps me evaluate cost control performance
let's now come to the capacitor c2 and while computing the constraint for capacitor c2 the independent source of course is set to 0 so it becomes a short circuit, it is a voltage source which is 0 and the capacitor c1 we assume has been chosen properly so that is also a short circuit
now hopefully it is clear; each of the points in space are apart spread apart by delta x, each of the time instances are spread apart by delta t, that is the discretization in space and time right
so, conductance is always positive it is v square or i square; whatever may be the positive or negative value, vi does not matter if this p is always positive, right
so, such kind of representation represent steel
so, we will first try to find out the equivalent resistance of the circuit
so, in the last class we discuss about the basics of norton's theorem and we did some the examples with the help of the sources which were independent in those circuits
so, as soon as this voltage is improved basically numerator is increasing right so; that means, compare to this one then what will be the your sub just just for just for your sake of understanding suppose suppose this one ah this one suppose p loss let me write you in a better fashion such that understand your ah your concept will be clear
i did not choose a testing function right
so, it will become 29
that ratio would be sales to working capital, which is known as working capital turnover ratio, which is just a transposition of this ratio
so, the parallel beams from satellites coming, they will reflect touch this parabolic mirror, reflux at different locations; from there finally, converged to a point focal, focus or foci point and this point what we call vortex for a parabola
now, out of the this part here ok, in this part counting will the counting happen no, so, here also no counting
so, implicitly if we do not say anything it is like we put a 1 here right
so some simple noise implication says that if the noise is less than the noise margin which your circuit is suppose to tolerate, then you should not worry about it
peak to peak voltage is decreased, you see peak to peak is 14
500 into 28,000 divided by 4,000
so, will see that there are two data movement instruction one is sorry one is mov and the other is movx
there is a; there are beautiful movies which have come up on this; when the person starts forgetting and they did
now, to give you a brief history of this case study itself, is that, arcturus is a star in a constellation called bootes
so we consider an example like: let us just draw this circuit separately
so, you have just simply 4 ampere current source 3 ohm resistance short circuit and this 15 volt voltage source in series with 3 ohm resistance
we use dry oxidation when you have gate oxides, thin layer of oxide because wet oxidation creates a path for the electron that can flow, which causes a problem in your circuit
so, r norton will be is equal to your 8 plus 5
so, this is my mean flux path
now normally what we have done, we are using one control line from the microcontroller to control the speed
so, r thevenin basically v thevenin by i sc is equal to r norton v o c is v thevenin
so, after taking these six items you get total expense
without losing, so what is essential is the peak capacity is retained without drop in the peak capacity, deformation capacity should be available
and this much of the surplus cash is invested in the market, then again we started receiving the cash and uhhh cash started going up then we started using the cash should went down again it is going up which is going down and when it came down to this level that is the control limit that is the lower control limit it means it became a 0 level, when it be reach at this 0 level immediately we took action and sold the securities in the market
so, locate 80 mm from one of the edges 80 mm on this scale, this is the edge all the way to 40 mm we have to locate a slot
so we had seen that some of the timing constraints maybe corresponding to false path
so, this is where right so basis function a is like this, basis function b is like this
so, i am showing something like the cross section or longitudinal section, are you get my point
so even frame size 3 is okay and we have 24 by 3 which is 8 frames available in one major cycle and we have 7 task instances in a major cycle and therefore even this is acceptable
so, along that shared edge the direction of the field is unique, there is no flipping happening across so
now why it has been done or why it is suggested to be done just to find out that if anything at any time or at any point of time things go out of control
so, you will have l wrench kind of thing through which you will operate it
if i look at the negative charge it gives me a field like this towards the centre, because the negative charge at any point
we can quote the example of marilyn monroe who is known for her breathy voice
so, that is why it is plus v 1 , and here also when we move in this loop, it is your what you call plus ah terminal it is encountering
incident wave is some wave is given to you
though, thin film or thick film can be used to fabricate active components and it will further result in increased size
next one is trade payables
ok, you, of course the input connections are not shown, but these are incomplete inverter
now if the load is delta connected, in that case the neutral point will be absent
at that time, this if you if you imagine, you will find it is a single turn, you will find all the flux will link to this; that means, voltage generated will be maximum, right
gn plus 1; this pulse would be to the will it overlap with the previous function
the outline will be visible on the left of the slide as always
so this gt is given by this expression gp is given by this expression and ga or the available power gain is given by this expression now you might ask me what is the problem with gt see gt if you notice carefully it has it is a function of this gamma out this term but then gamma out itself is a function of gamma s isn’t it here for example here i have written the expression for gamma out as we can see gamma out is a function of gamma s
so let us say i take the same structure, so this is a c shaped magnet and i am going to have one more movable part
so, in this particular session, we discussed about 2 theorems
the one we will be using is stm32f401 nucleo board, it is based on arm cortex m4, and it has got 96 kb of sram
so unless otherwise mentioned for operating point calculations and for gm calculations omit the effect of lambda but the lambda will cause the most transistor to have an output conductance gds
so, that is why i have written like this that minus 5 t by 4 into t dt
this smile is passed on when we know that we are not in a situation to help the other people
05 units and that is what we call detail dimensions, any intricate things which we would like to specifically show, then a separate thing like rounding it off into circle and show it
now this whole plane is the z plane
2 very light and then totally off; and this cycle repeats
and it is hollow, so again we have that hollow, all the way we have this hollow portion which goes all the way down; this is the way we represent front view of this pedestal kind of bracket
i mean ok, it is not nothing but it is of the order of fifty thousand euros which is fairly low
the symbol is r
so, we can say things, supposing, we want to print the value of x and y, but we want to indicate to the output, which is x, which is y
so, how do i deal with it
now, if you try to do this, what will be your expectation
so, this is the open circuit test, where i have not shown any isolation transformer, what i could have shown is directly apply it through a variac and the variac in all probability will be connected to the top point, no isolation
suppose we know that v is equal to v f plus v b, but when traveling will be arriving here the capacitor give the short circuit
today most of us develop the software in some high level language, either in c or in python or in java, but it is always good to know the lower level features of the processor in order to have an informed decision that which processor may be better for a particular application
so, v will be 4 unit distance
welcome to module 12 of programming in c++
and we know that most of it is arising from the calcination of limestone
the formula was standard rate into actual yield minus standard yield
similarly, from that reference base this one is at 30 units
and, a parametric form if you have point p0, p 1 and p 2 any new point perhaps p one can construct in terms of your p0 point
summising is that when you prepare a journal you prepare the leisure trial and finally the trial balance
so we have made an estimate of the eccentricities
so, this particular resistance value this is ifrf line i told you, so the slope of this line basically is going to give me whatever is the resistance value
so anyway i migrated from the dc machine to the induction motor
in practice what is done is we have an inequality that is c1 much greater than 1 by omega times r1 parallel r2 plus rs
so, i got 14 variables 7 equations
you should remember that the output side is not at the ground potential
then we have something called gross direct co2 emissions which excludes this electricity production in addition to the biomass
so so if c is zero means i have y equal to open
but if you were to look at a perforated reinforced masonry shear wall, the one item that would change and you need to adequately consider that in your calculations is the overturning moment causes different axial forces in pairs
let us see what equations tell us about these amplitudes and the fields, if they exist, like this
so, we saw that our opening balance was $5,000 and we had to keep $5,000 as the minimum cash
so, it is coming 2 into your 7 by 17 by 18
so, it can be analyzed that if input is not connected vin equals to 0 and ideally vout equals to 0, but because of input bias current there is an output voltage even at 0 input
so, we also have to keep a table which allows me to go from a local edge to a global edge numbering
we can grow silicon dioxide using lpcvd, now we have coated spin coated photoresist after spin coating we know, it is time for soft bake and we already know that whenever we use silicon, we had to clean it
that is what he is expertise on
so if you want to find out the value of r1 in terms of delta branches, what you will do
so, in this case it is n to s naturally upper part this is the plus plus can carry on as per our convention current entering into the plane
out of them, one is good, so number of faulty signature will be this minus one that map into the golden signature
important points, yes, i would like to write
so this is the basic concept as i said on which the smith chart, concept of smith chart arises
now, instead of instead of your what you call d g suppose instead of if it is a if it is a capacitor, if it is some capacitor say suppose this is your load this is your load this is load i say this is your p l plus j q l and this is your capacitor this is your capacitor
so, it means that it the class a to which this a belongs, this a belongs to class a must have an operator assignment which takes an operand of type b which does not exist
so i have to decide on that, i have to decide on which function i would need to call
so when this clock h comes, clock one, this data is already ready
you need to have some special circuitry to do a/d conversion
so, only 10000 coefficients were needed, then i got a little bit greedy i did a little bit more optimization within this wavelet domain and i look at only 7 percent coefficients
so, it is given v1 = 2400 volt v2 is given 400 volt i0 is given 0
for geometric tolerancing it allows for specification of tolerance, for geometry of the part separate from its size
ok, just an example that a good placement can lead to a much neater network, much shorter wire lengths
basically, the major passive elements in our electrical circuits are resistor, capacitor, and inductor
and also when you say negligible, you have to specify some accuracy
we have a low priority task that is holding a resource
we primarily know mcluhan for introducing us to the term global village in his works, but he has also talked about the concept of time
so then we go for something like we call it as currently attainable or expected standards
and that money if where we are investing that money if the rate of interest we are earning from that investment is more than the cost we are going to pay to the suppliers
the moment you solve for ia and i have the speed as 400 rpm i should be able to calculate what is the value of vt, vt will be eb plus ia ra
similarly if i say this cell is these community of cells what i am growing is suppose to secrete insulin, then i expect that they will form this kind of clustering and should be able to see they are secreting insulin which of course, i have to quantify by some kind of titration or whatever right
if you look at type 1, you can see that it's important to have a limitation on the eccentricity of loading because if there is going to be significant distance between the line of action and the line of action of force and the line of support, you are going to have additional moments acting on the joint
now, instructor 3 seems to have two goals here one of which is to use more sophisticated technology in the e content which itself does not accomplish any teaching learning objectives and thus does not seem like an effective integration of technology
now if i can draw an analogy between this two, i will see that the auxiliary field of the point dipole is equivalent to the electric field of a electric dipole
so, let this case consider vgs 2 is less than vgs 1; that means, channel and vgs vg s is channel width right if i increase channel width my conductivity would increase, or my resistance would decrease
similarly, we can say that a date is made up of three parts a day, a month, and a year; and we can encloses into a three value or triple
now when people start calculating the rcs of some aircraft they do not want the value of the rcs at one angle
let's see how the frame size is to be set
you remember in chunk we said that 5 to 9 chunks can be stored
so, let me write the expression for f of e
hence it is indeed a 90¡ coupler
also assume that all borings are effective at the beginning of the month and all payments are made at the end of the month of repayment
so we say that this cut size is four
and moreover, i barely noticed anyone else doing the head tilt especially, not for the sake of raising interest, but where we can see the head tilt in action is the television
now these two blocks are available in the a block library
so, she took the bottle of medicine and this bottle of medicine is child proof
if you have very high and most of the time when you do the testing your testing systems are kept here outside the, or the electrodes which you talk about it as all actually outside the concrete
2 kilonewton and that is greater than 200 kilonewton ok so here the design tensile strength of angle we are getting lesser of these three tdg tdb and tdn that is 261
so in view of this, if i if i try to see if i have in key in q, i create a c type of object, and i am using two pointers, one is a q pointer two point, and one is a p pointer two point
the takeaways for us as we design using a learner centric approach are that we need to close the learning loop
ok, now let us moves step by step
because there is no any other source available in the circuit, which can supply current i
which value
but if it is a sizable amount, we will show it as exceptional item because it is not going to happen every year
so there are basically fundamental differences in the way you represent integers and floating point numbers inside a computer and therefore, one has to be careful to distinguish between the two
the same gesture which the japanese used to indicate that everything is good can be treated as an insulting gesture in arabian countries
between the namespace and the class every namespace is not a class and every class in turn defines a namespace
if you see this circuit you will have four meshes created, so that is why we have four mesh currents like i 1, i 2, i 3 and i 4
now the capacitance and resistance are in parallel and this voltage would be applied across both of the components because both are in parallel
now, if you look at the pm interaction curve and then for different locations on the pm interaction curve, different locations on the pm interaction curve, if i were to draw a moment curvature diagram for that section, if i were to make a moment curvature diagram for that section, if i were to make a moment curvature diagram for that section, you would get typical moment curvature curves based on section analysis
now, in the first method, as we discussed, we assume input and we found the output while in second method, we assume the output and then find the input
n segments, you increase this n right
so, the set of the first order equation which we get in that the variables which you have define like x1, x2 to xn we call them as state variable
we saw in the previous slide that the momentum density was mu zero sigma k
distributed, plus while you are assessing kids what is also very very important
so, i is equal to say if we write i angle 0 sometimes we are writing small i or capital i it does not matter, this is your i right
and other way v b n is lagging from v a n by 120 degree, and v c n is lagging from v b n by 120 degree, and v c n is lagging from v n from v n by 240 degree, because this v n is reaching it is peak fast than v b n right
from o make an arc somewhere there
so, here similarly, that means, if t is t 0 is equal to 0 then it will be 0 minus to 0 plus integration f t d t f t delta t d t and that is f 0 because this one this one just i am making it
so, we will also see lot of experiments as a part of this course
so, if this way similarly for the other this mesh 3, you can apply mesh 3; also you can apply kvl
if you do so it will be minus 8 plus 2 i, minus 3 i is equal to 0; that means, minus 8 minus i is equal to i is equal to minus 8 ampere
the absorption is going to happen along this it is the exponential decay along the z direction yeah
these are the points through which this rope length is a winding rope
the sentence written is that, in the conduction region, the current rate of an depletion or of a depletion type mosfet is slower than the current rate in enhancement type mosfet, is this statement true or false that is a question
so, these are just a few points about intrinsic semiconductor; we will be using them today during the course of the assignment
when you talk about the operating budget, what you are talking about here is you have to prepare many sub budgets because master budget is basically a comprehensive document
so, balance sheet is a statement which summarizes asset on one side and external and internal liabilities on the other side
so, we will have to proceed from left to right and compute that in the result will turn out to be 3
i anticipate by biosphere law that magnetic field around this is going to be the circular direction
so, is exactly exact thing what you call whatever you design you may not get whatever you this thing, but you will have some kind of idea
similarly, if one is looking from this direction, this one always be opaque on the back side, but this one is transparent wall
so, what you can actually see in this three dimensional figure is sigma 1 and sigma 2 as the 2 axis, the y axis and the x axis, sigma 1 in tension, sigma 2 in compression
so plus will work on b and c, you get something
74 that is theoretical maximum packing this you can manipulate and put in a few more sizes and get to a higher value
unfortunately, human assets are not permitted to be shown on the balance sheet
let me write down, micro electro mechanical systems based sensor
because we said that essentially the total you know total actually area will correspond to lambda times i which will be actually the rectangle and then you are going to have the diagonal exactly intersecting you know the area into two halves exact two halves because of which wf and wf dash will turn out to be one and the same in terms of the magnitude
because if motor shrinks too much it's established a bond with the unit but if it shrinks too much you can have failure at the bond by the time the wall gains strength and hardens
63 times 10 to the minus 18 meter cube, so that is a really small number
similarly, actually let me just go up bit back to the previous class
in #b, h is going to be equal to
so you see, i've given you two examples where we can calculate a directly from a current distribution, and now i can take its curl and get my answer for b
and it will not send any message unless there is a change in the position of this device
so i may have something like a rubber lining or whatever so that will essentially make sure that the two are insulated from each other
now how do we obtain this v0 minus irm
so, therefore, this path gets disconnected for a brief moment and then the entire current should or must flow through the meter through the meter only and this current maybe is a of a higher value than the fsd current or the allowable current through the meter and then the meter may get damaged, because for a brief moment there is no parallel path ok
now, in the second case, we have to raise the speed to 750 rpm
so, as we change the duty cycle the average value of voltage that gets applied to the relay and hence the bulb will vary in proportional to the duty cycle
the other side of the story is the guilt which adults have by doing all this
and finally, when two people are walking together and their steps are matched going right left, right left at the same time; they want to talk to each other and they are probably friends although that is not technically a rule, but they want to talk to each other
so, that will show you later
if you see the statement of this experiment, we will be interfacing the electric bulb, we have already seen how we shall be interfacing the circuit, and will be switching it on and off
let me just quickly take you through what the code could look like
this quantity alpha is the distance from where the axle load is acting to the centroid of the steel, the tension steel itself normalized to the effective depth d, which is from the edge compression fiber to the centroid of the tension steel
so what we do
now this shows two things, one the fact that we acquires certain know rules, certain guidelines from our environment, that is what is know, let me development theory
so, this is the very say technical process and you can call it as the process which is causing the serious losses to the board
and there is a tiny hole passing through that, that we can represent by this long dash dashed line; this is the way we get a sectional view of the object
so, you can mark them out to begin with just a simple smiley and a sad face
once done we have this point 1, now join a 1 b to construct the triangle
okay, so now we would move from the elf executable to processes, so we would see what happens when you do, when you run dot/a dot out on your shell we would see how the process gets created and we would see how the elf executable gets transferred from the disk into your ram
so, at this point; in between this activation of pc low and this activation of this psen bar
but the point is when reading definition of f g is not used it is only remembered that this statement which should be in a bracket, just to be consistent
so in that way either you apply mesh analysis or the nodal analysis in both way you will get the thevenin voltage same
so, tau is equal to l by r, the time constant say this is equation 67 and a is a constant which you have to determine and we know that natural response is always a what you call decaying exponential
so if i say that these are majority of the flux lines path, some of the flux lines can definitely go through this, like this
no load and open circuit are synonymous with each other, they are synonymous with each other, okay
s m level we can take some decisions like this when we can do clock gating, to stop the clock
so, differentiation based on load started occurring
now, another 1 is that figure 26 shows the simple circuit under dc condition, determine i v c v l and the energy stored in the what you call in the capacitor
and by the rule, since this is the order in which the construction happened, naturally the destruction will have to happen in the reverse order
so, when you will be connecting the bluetooth module connected with the stm board to your mobile phone bluetooth device, these two will communicate with each other
if one uses a low dropout regulator, v drop can be as low as point by holds and you will have a very less dissipation and drop out there and you will not lose out much on the size of the transformer code likewise for the other winding also likewise for this other winding, you can put a three terminal regulator and accordingly adjust the output required or output requirement of the regulator
so if you see that only possibilities of the 15% opportunity cost, 30% opportunity cost cannot be accepted it is ruled out, then the decision is very clear that we should i wear this discount of 200 rupees
also jumbling up the order of statements and function definitions in this way, makes it much harder to read the program and understand what it is doing
here, in the first angle projection size always be our the views on which we are going to project, those will be opaque and the direction through which we are going to see will be transparent
find the value of r l for which the source delivers maximum, it will be to this maximum power right power is using
for this we have to select one any one of the part
you can specify this as a constant or you can also specify some register, logical shift left by r5; whatever is the value in r5 that many bits will be shifted
so we write it down in terms of this value is equal to 1 by 1 plus delta 1 plus entire set in the denominator 1 by delta 1 plus 1 by delta 2 plus 1 by delta 3 but we also know that because of this because of the fact that the reciprocal of the stiffness is going to give you the deflection 1 by k 1 plus 2 plus 3 the total stiffness of the peer group is going to be the summation of the corrected deflections delta 1 delta 2 plus delta 3 so each of those therefore the the deflection of the pure group is if you use this which is nothing but because deflections and the stiffnesses are reciprocals and the first expression we can then arrive at the total deflection this is of the peer group this is of the individual peers
so this notation i am just repeating for your convenience: this i and j indicate two blocks
so, it means in this case you prepare the balance sheet here, that is the budgeted balance sheet and in this side we are taking the capital and liabilities
if we are looking that we are supposed to see these legs here and there is a sudden rise, sudden rise on that and it goes meets at this location, after that looks like there might be something like a cylindrical kind of object
now in contrast in private inheritance, if you look at the same thing the same set of classes, the same functions, the same to p and s, eat p will work, but what is see eat s, if you have defined this as a private inheritance
so, i thought of how we go through the data sheet and let us see, how are what are the parameters given and whether we understand those parameter, whether we can solve some equations solve some problems regarding to that particular parameters right
so, for this we will have some equilibrium distance
so, and i capital i 3 is equal to i 4 because this is a last node i 3 is equal to i 4
so you can say that the component of i 2 flowing through 2 ohm resistance is nothing but he negative of the current flowing that is the negative of the current i 1
so, why
so, in this typically you will get all the bars in tension, but whether or not all the bars would actually reach the peak value, the permissible tensile force asi into fs is something that is typically not seen
similarly, if you subtract equation 1 from equation 2 right; that is, equation 2 minus equation 1, you will get p 2 minus p 1 is equal to v l i l sin theta right or if, you multiply both side by root 3 then root 3 v l i l sin theta is equal to root 3 into p 2 minus p, minus p 1 right
assume that the input voltage is 3
you have a controlled environment, but there could be cases where you still have a better control over the environment, but it is not real lab set up actually
so, on the left column, what you see, does not use static member it is what you have been introduced to earlier in terms of the data members and member function
once you have all those black dots then the intersection of the best fit line, this red line being the best fit line, intersection of the best fit line will give you tau knot
but if i draw the same thing d q as here, but if i put a triangle and i write enable, then this triangle symbol means this is a level triggered d flip flop sorry edge triggered d flip flop
so, it will give you numerical convergence, but you have solved laplace equations, instead of maxwell’s equations equation
these three points are given
this is the impedance of the branch
and when you talk about the management of the cash we compare it sometimes with the management of inventory
here you are not measuring any temperature, you are only using it for motion detection
what will happen if i do that
we also need the occupation probability; you can assume that the occupation is a simple boltzmann function
t1 has execution time of one, period one, deadline, sorry, period four, deadline four
10 ampere current, next common ground, right here see volt, resistance, temperature, hertz, milliampere, micro ampere means you can if you measure voltage, you can connect to this particular terminal
so, your number of unknowns
so, this is coincident mate
25% of the transducer range, it should not drift, meaning that the zero should not keep on changing by itself, it should be stable and it should have the right polarity, this is very very important and what does this mean
so, now, the value of current flowing delta i would be the value of vc which you will see in the voltage source would be i into delta r
now, corresponding to this i am going definitely have a higher voltage but please note i have already attained close to saturation because of which the voltage has increased only slightly may be 118 or 119 v
so, on this side, i have a p type semiconductor at the center, i have an intrinsic and here i have an n type
so, this one if from apex all the way to centre of the circle, if we are joining that may not be 90 degrees; it makes an angle alpha, such kind of cones are called right circular cones, and these are generally named as cones
it is a very popular way of biasing the circuit
in two dimensions if we are seeing that, it makes 120 degrees angle, in between these sides
suppose, this is your what you call this side is a and this side is b
by adding a really small amount of arsenic, so much small that it is of the order of parts per billion, we have increase the conductivity by more than 5 orders of magnitude
44 degree ampere
it is at least greater than ninty five percent
so you are ready
any edge you cut it will divide up into two parts, because you know a tree is a kind of a graph where there is a unique path between two vertices
it take some time is not that easy that you any time you want to sell the securities into market
and, we will also have another term, so this will get multiplied by e to the power some call it sigma t or minus sigma t
so, generally whenever we talk about muscle culture, we talked about there are 2 possible ways and here we will talk about say skeletal muscle
now if the server actually sent the same challenge again, the man in the middle the attacker would be able to actually respond to that corresponding challenge without actually forwarding the challenge to the device
lets say some of the point here
and you start with the following introduction
now control of def of course we have to understand whether it is really a problem depending upon the situation it can be a problem, if you have very high temperatures during precasting so generally because of that most concrete it says the specification for concrete construction typically put a limit on the maximum temperature permissible inside the concrete
hello and welcome back to this module on empathize
in between this and this the variance will be called as the sales activity variance, sales activity variance and this column will be known as the flexible budget variance
so, it is going to be if i am going to use my fantastic drawing skills this would be alpha then gamma and beta and it is a plane that is at suspended by these heights over here ok
so, this particular function becomes drawrec function and so on
and then in the last module, we have formally introduced a notion of binding
5 v1 is magnitude v1 square into the v2 square plus r 1 square plus x 1 square into p 2 square plus q 2 square is equal to 0, this rewriting equation what this number is 74, right
so, now, proceeding further towards our actual objective, what we did right now was the general derivation
in this case of in that case of squirrel cage motor all these things are not there because rotor itself is shorted
so, effort is measured normally person month
i was looking at her history, i heard interview of her mother, who said that in the family nobody is into wrestling, but then they go on to say that sakshis grandfather happened to be a wrestler
so, just let me clear it
so, this is how you can derive the formula for the magnitude of voltage gain, in case of the low pass active filter
so, so many you know, in this case, now we are seeing that your rc circuit
and this session and the next one will be solving a assignment, number five and assignment number six
we know bound surface charges are nothing but p
so, this way your b h loop will be completed right
this is the apparent wavelength and this term is related to the frequency like this
i have the resistor r1 over there
so, if we want to demonstrate this tangent mate we will select this surface and this slot path holding the control and click on mate
this is the arduino uno board, this is the 5 volt pin, which is connected to the gsm 5 volt pin
so, we will be using a combination of two axial extensometer one is axial extensometer, another one is a video extensometer and with combination of this we will be trying to find the strain variation or the displacement in this material with respect to the load acting on the element
so, let us first write the mathematical equation for the translational mechanical system, which you are seeing in the figure
so, if we use the public data that is if we do not enforce information hiding then you can very well see that between these two codes, which both of each are actually trying to take a string and reverse it
how do i simplify further, do i have a relation that tells me what is del cross b, do i have a relation that tells me del cross h
so so if this is not ensured, your this operation of this circuit might fail, ok
so percentage of the faults in f that can be detected by t
so based on this, you know this, you know this by design, this by design, this by design, this can be the value, data sheet value chosen from the other chosen device
if i go for 159 hertz, it is decreasing, because now this is slightly below our cut off frequency
so, what we do in this coordinate stretching approach is going to be very interesting
you see what is physical verification
a standard prism is made by stacking one brick over another and having about five or six bricks in one stack
now i want to calculate more complicated problems for which there is no analytical solution
so, half l is 0
and certainly while building the data type, there are certain point to keep in mind which i would specifically like to remind you off is a fact that while you bring a data type
so, if you plot like this it will be and an omega c minus 1 upon l omega less than 0
we have two alternative modes of operation it is an error to try an append to a non existent key, but if there is an existing key we do not want to lose it by reassigning s
iimpedance in this condition is minimum, which is resistance r
which i would like to little bit highlight you to
just to give an example of a real time system let us say that in a chemical reactor if the temperature exceeds 500 degrees, then the coolant shower must be turned down within 100 milliseconds
so, in the transmitting mode i am going to draw the circuit equivalent of antenna right
for example, if it is a cast iron or general use of all materials we show it by incline 45 degrees lines as a hatch and these are the parallel lines we have to really represent
its period and deadline are the same
now if i say csv line dot split using comma as a separator and then i get a list of values the string 6, the string 7, the string 8
so, this is called an input streaming operator, it is again a pair of arrows, but the arrows now direct in the left from left to right
now, let us compare these two instruments; so two instruments two meters; this is one, this is another
and as you will later see, it also plays a major role in what happens when we pass values to functions as arguments
some of them about size, position, how to represent them and for example, if there are any diameters how to represent them
so, in that case this is in active right it is short it is shorted
primarily, students do not get the opportunity for immediate application and practice after they learn the content from each of the interactive videos
so, we take board dot queen dot keys will give us 0 1 upto n minus 1 in some random order we sort them and for each such row we print the row and the column number for that row
so, this kind of dimensioning which we are going to learn it in this lecture
so if i have a circuit for example that i am going to have an alternating voltage then may be a resistance may be an inductance, another resistance may be a capacitance and another resistance, it is not going to be very easy for me to draw for each of them, let us say i call this as il, i call this as ir1, and i call this as ir2, let me call this as may be i through c and let me call this is ir3 and when i add these that is these two currents i will be able to get what is ir3 and when i add the voltage drops across these two elements and this element i will be able to get what is the voltage source, but it’s not going to be easy for me to draw all these phases and add them
what will have
so, at the boundary, what is the value of n
and because it is made up of silicon steel or ferromagnetic material to establish a flux which will cause electromagnetic induction in the secondary side i would not require a large amount of mmf
so, while you do the design of classes please keep this point in mind because copy assignment operator is a very critical operator which needs to be overloaded
ok, so these are some of the techniques which are usually used
now, similarly now that is i that is i1 enters the dotted terminal of coil 1
but spice is a circuit simulation tool which is pretty accurate
so, , we will come back to this
this tells that i am going to read from infile and write to outfile
now, next to sketch there is something like features button
now it features go through at a very high level, we just look at this invocation, we see that the e value is used over here, essentially e i would indicate the ith be present in e
also, i think the adults who are into care giving should not be hyper sensitive to small changes
for parallel projections which are quite common for our engineering drawing course and machine designing kind of courses there are two types of projections exists, one is orthogonal projection, other one is oblique projection
so this would be the the input output relationship for the forward converter that we have drawn shown here and when this inductor when the inductor when the inductor here is freewheeling in this fashion, this diode is off, secondary is open, the primary is also freewheeling in this fashion
method of moments
so, all this line has to be rotated in that direction
this time, power gain or operating power gain comes across frequently, now what is this power gain
we have seen how to fabricate an inter digitated electrode in an su 8 well and how to fabricate a gas sensor
now how we have arrived at this profit
4 kilowatt per phase
they weren’t producing enough current that they were giving other problems like acidification around the surface of the concrete and of direct failure like some of the paint systems would flake off after a while and at that time only two systems actually, stood out
so when you are distributing the vdd and the ground signal across the chips, there is one similarity with clock is that the number of terminal points are large in number if you consider this standard cell kind of layout
so, e is the energy in joules, k b is called boltzmann constant and is equal to 1
so you get v
for example the cyclic executives, the rate monotonic algorithm and the earliest deadline first algorithm
like you calculate stresses, strains, how much stock you really apply on that bolt, whether it can really sustain, what kind of materials one has to use these kind of things you will get it in machine design data books
so the peer is considered as an element that provides additional lateral stability to the wall
so, expressions will have to exist as statement
it tells us that the corrosion rate must be decreasing
so here with me i have an example of how what a textile is this is glass fibre textiles these are e glasses coated e glass textiles
base class has another function g and derived class as overridden that function as well
so, this is my delta connected load, this is my delta connected load right and this is phase a, phase b, phase c
so, if i have a unknown voltage source and i want to measure the voltage of this, i have to connect the voltmeter v across this like this
so, the heater heats up quickly so that it very quickly attains the set value
if on the other hand, we gave it a string like òa5ó, since a is not a valid number, òa5ó would actually generate an error
we cannot even have s equal to r equal to 0 because s equal to r is never possible in this circuit, they are always opposite
a credit card has a card number which is typically a 16 character string
then, some charge will flow within that duration and that charge can be measured with a ballistic galvanometer
r 2 and r 1 this forms a close loop
if these 2 did not meet at the same point, there is no way for you to fix it because whatever is happening here has no role to play over here, whatever is happening here as no rule to play over here
the following things
actual price of the labour has exceeded the standard price of the labour
if these are square components we use symbol squares
so this will be your physical
or, somebody is having a fit or epilepsy or somebody is having a infection or something that is a different or suddenly fails kid fails, one failing is alright
the expression for n i, square root of n c n v exponential minus e g over 2 kt, n c and n v, where the effective density of states at the conduction band edge and the valence band edge and e g, is the band gap of the material
but please convince yourselves that the logical arguments leading to this amplifier are correct
so this you can verify the values
you cannot have keys, which are mutable values
hope this you have understood this actually whenever you take this one that is basically will take this past history of the current flowing through the capacitor right that is the idea
so, stator windings are here
then we have a conduction band, the bottom of the conduction band is referenced as e c and the top of the conduction band e c plus chi and this distance between valence and conduction band is e g
here, there is a 0 point ccurrent is 0, because there is no load connected
the first and foremost thing is that you need to download the software, the ide
and again just like in replace we could control how many times we replaced, here we can also control how many splits you make
so, this is one projector other one is this projector, this supposed to be a projector passing through ok, this is the line
inspite of all these assumptions the ciphers are designed in such a way that it any attack would be extremely inefficient to develop
whether it is a quarterly statement or it is the annual statement, you can simply convert that quarterly statement into the annual statement when you consolidate the information for all the four quarters into the annual information
mean free path should be as large as possible, as large as possible
so accordingly, you keep measuring the mass of the sample at different time intervals and once you plot the change in mass over time, square root of time you take the slope of that curve which will be absorption rate of the moisture inside the sample
so as you know, as we discussed in the previous class, the smith chart originates from the concept of the reflection coefficient
now instead of mesh analysis you can also apply nodal analysis as well
for instance, if there is an artistic work in the form of a book, then the creator of the book or the person who owns the book or who created the book could stop other people from using that book from making copies of that book from disseminating information from the book by different ways, because he has an exclusive right over it, in this case we call that right of copyright
so, i have the channel initially right, you can see here initially there is a channel like this, now if i keep on increasing vds , then slowly even if i keep on increasing i change the vgs slowly, the channel will start shrinking, towards the drain side
so,if i want shunt configuration i will connect them in parallel to the same voltage supply that is it
for example, you can have an active region that is made a gallium arsenide and your inactive regions could be p type aluminum gallium arsenide on one side and n type aluminum gallium arsenide on the other
next example i want to take we will use gauss’s law and in this i want to take a positively charge sphere superimpose it on a negatively charge sphere and calculate the field due to this superposition of these two in this region, where they overlap
so, this is 3 by omega s into i f l square into r 2 dash upon s f l right and where s f l is equal to full load slip
tthis resonance will be caught by the vibrating crystal piezoelectric material, this material is piezoelectric and there will be change in the electrical signal
so, now instead of using the mos transistor, we can try to use this basic device and implement our control sources using negative feedback
but it's not popular, rarely used in applications
but for now let us assume that they are known, we subtracted them and applied some vector calculus to get this relation after which we applied our divergence theorem to get this relation right
so, the easiest thing is, first of all, construct a perpendicular line
in the first part of this module, we have seen how objects can be constructed using the constructor of classes, how implicitly constructors get called and they can be used to initialize data members of objects by specifying through the initialization list, and we have also seen how we can have parameterized constructors
so, you learn the general theory and then we applied to two problems ok
so, a mode suppressor is a device is a circuit which allows certain modes to pass through and does not allow other modes to pass through
so, these are the few things, we have to take into consideration when we do this
so, 55 mm is this one
25 into 2 into (1
if you sum it up these total figures subtracted from the 6 lakhs, so how much you are left with this with here is that the net operating profit before tax is 6132
so, this is again v 1 and v 2 and so, this is my point over here that is r prime
and we have this maximum dimensions represented here and the hidden lines goes only at that level
keep in mind this is a rarest of a rare case
so here we show these figures: separation, width, thickness and also the aspect ratios
39 and il no sorry this is actually il sorry vertical one sorry not 43
now last time we had studied pcs but this is important and more interesting because this is a manufacturing company which is which has more figures because it invests in variety of types of assets
this capacity i mean institutively or philosophically you can tell this is capacitor when you connect it is q i c, q c means it is also injecting current here i c
so x is a factor
06 and it has become 0 now
the core loss windage and friction loss together are lumped as rotational loss as both these losses occur when the motor is running right
if, we are looking from this view, this line will be visible perhaps it might be coming that, this line naturally comes here and this line perhaps going a back side
now i define my first shape function as the area of triangle 1
and of course, there are many, many more things that we see day today, which are executed by computer programs
that is why bank balances in saving and current accounts will be considered not in the fd account
so, for example, over here in this case the attacker would need to know where the address of gadgets1, gadget2, gadget3 and gadget4 are present in the library
the value of ltp is same as this and value of utp is same as this
so, this search let us just select the component vertex to the center of this ball and the path as it is not visible as of now
so, yellow value is the peak, blue values are the valleys and what are these arrows showing you these arrows are showing you the direction of the negative gradient because i want to always go in the direction of negative gradient that is the steepest descent that will take me to the minima
so, they are called cca core current assets
so, if that is the case if we learn how the wein bridge is oscillator operates then let us solve some problems right let us solve some problems
so, then there is a push to create the arguments for the resolver and then there is a jump to the resolver
they will be accessed from the class name using the colon colon or scope resolution operator
so in this both kn and vt appear
frying water evaporates or water diffuses is out because of the heat
another common gesture is what can be termed as the precision grip and its variations, as if you are holding something delicate and important between your thumb and your fingertips
so here let me just redraw this circuit again
unlike, the previous case where the loader goes on changing each and every location where the global data is used, here we are using a single got table which stores the correct address for the global data
that is the concept that we will need further over here
the area calculation is shown
so even then four conductors are able to transmit 3 p whereas here two conductors, two conductors are transmitting only p, so obviously we are saving on the cost of copper
now naturally, if you use a global function then we know that is not an advisable thing a in object oriented programming system, because the global functions, but to work they naturally needed that the data members the ma particularly the real and imaginary part of the complex number
66,100 is the collection and payments are very few only that is how much
so, in this condition 2 since these instructions following have been speculatively executed the processor would realize that in fact this speculation was wrong and these instructions were actually not to be executed
12 by 6 is 2, so 2 square, 2 square means 4
we have seen this before when talking about ammeters and voltmeters
yeah that is a good idea
but mind well, there are several items in the balance sheet which do not come in p&l but which are directly reflected in cash flow statement
now i have to connect the this to the input of the amplifier ok
as we learnt earlier, we also like to think in electrostatics and this becomes very important later in terms of electric field
so, 1to t 1 to, but we want to in between 0 and 2 seconds
and so, this is the input port, say this is the isolated port, now s 11, s 31, s21 and s 41 are just like we had seen in the case for branch line coupler
knight as a chess piece starting at a position s x comma s y
what we have done here is this
also, you could send break points such as b to line number 10, so what this means is that the program will execute until the break point 10 act line number 10 is obtained
so the connections you can specify by giving the names appropriately, so, as you can see here and this diagram once more, the output of one stage is coming as the input of the other, output of one stage is coming at the input of the other
we will just understand the definition
it becomes inventory of finished goods
so, the standard setting committee has to review their performance and they have to see that is the, are the standard set already are higher
and that is equal to 3 upon 4 point upon point 1 4 5 and that is nearly equal to 10 db, okay
we will see how we go about choosing the core for the transformer and then later on for the inductor and also to decide on the number of turns the thickness of the copper wire that you would use and all those things for both the forward converter transformer and the inductor for this we will use an approach called the area product approach and follow through in a systematic step by step manner
open stubs or shorted stubs can always can be easily connected in shunt but not in series
but here i will tell you that just i will explain that simple thing
because, this is line this is your, this is line, so this is also line, so that will be line to line voltage right
so, in net sale you can say that networking capital is basically the funds coming from the long term sources right
25 into t is 12 fu is 410 so this is coming 113
i think that would pretty much be a normal thing, yeah straight face
the transfer function which is given to us is 4s upon s square plus 4s plus 20, so if you compare both of them you can simply say that r by l is nothing but equal to 4 and 1 by lc is equal to 20
so for the specification what is it, this is where you will change for doing iterations
now this is very important
now that location itself, we have to be ah, ah, within one of those rows
in part 2, we want to calculate the total depletion width, let me call that w that is the total depletion width so, the depletion width again forms because you have electrons and holes moving across the junction and are recombining
board members are supposed to be independent but they were taking money from enron in the form of consultancy and other fees
so, everywhere current everywhere current is known everywhere current is known this currents are known
so, momentarily that is why it is that is why we are writing here that momentarily the voltage is 0 or at the current of the forward wave is momentarily that is your what you call that doubled
now, again when it will come here right when it will be when it will coming here again it will be reflected back from the receiving end therefore, this side again it will be multiplied by rho r
if you solve this w actually become 196
similarly, if this edge one of the thing this e' point
usually the problem arises because of the conflict between your person of interest, your user, your customer and something else, it could be another human being, set of human beings or a thing, an object
what are the different kinds of costs you have to identify
so, this particular material requires a temperature of 300 to 500 degree centigrade
now let us see some applications of this
but take something as a; now if you look at something as a; the holocaust what hitler, but hitler if he was deluded; then the whole country was deluded believing in the aryan supremacy
so, we outside if, so this is unconditional we always update
the number of people who are ready to do workshops in the schools, the number of people who want to teach kids motivation takes this that, children are captive probably they will just, make them sit they will sit and listen and, half of it will go
so, if you are not giving any closed entities, it try to have this back end program which automatically assumes certain dimensions try to construct this
now, when does v d stay constant
this should be equal to e transmitted over v two in that medium
now in this vin is given and v0 is given
so, suppose the same machine, let us say is having a value of 1 lakh in the beginning and suppose the rate of depreciation is taken as 25%, then in year 1, it will be 1 lakh into 25%, that is 25,000
all right, i want to find the solution of this now
so, i would expect that you, this will give a quick recap to your fundamentals in c
so, this is the point where we started initially, z
so, that is that is all there is
now naturally how many jobs are currently ready for printing does not depend on the specific job, it depends on the total number of print job objects that have been constructed
i can right because i have a expression for f 2 n minus 1 x so, i know q, i know p, i know r
otherwise, go for extraction of a prism itself
second is there is a concept called mean free path
here i am basically doing the initialization, we are setting pin mode, pin 7 of arduino as output
because this super position is following the linearity property
does it also induce minus q and this is also grounded
but the guarantee is for next fires
if it is conducting for phase between 180 degree and 360 degree, then it is called class ab
so fly ash is considered a waste we do not generally assign any impact to it but there are other there are many researchers who are now saying that fly ash since it is being used to make concrete better it should also be allocated some impact
at this point let us pause at a reflection spot as instructors we want our learners to be able to do all these things
that is how susceptible, how responsible the system is to the applied, the electric field, or to the field at that point, chi images, that ok
so if its non zero and only are expressed by
it is very rarely that a code, particularly structural codes, would require that the code prescriptions are applicable retrospectively
and then once you develop the su 8 you will have a wafer with your interdigitated electrodes inside the su 8 well
so, again we will come back to this
we need to have some starting methods so that it starts on its own
now, how do we find the major cycle
so, now, let us just rewrite equation one over here
the physical inductor needs to be manufactured to obtain a value as you see on the screen here
so, we will continue our discussion of how to incorporate dispersive materials into fdtd
and it is a kind of a very sad disease because you are you because you know your name or you could identify yourself in a surrounding, but in an alzheimer’s patient you do not know who you are, because all your memory traces fades because of the death of the hippocampal neurons, and there are a lot of efforts across the world to understand what these kind of disease is and since it picks up at a later age
so, what happens to all the time derivatives, wherever you see a d by dt there is a j omega that will come out and the time derivative is gone right
so, factor of safety is 1
so, these two columns are important for us, column number one and the column number three and this variance which has occurred because of the difference between the performance level of the two columns, column number one and column number three and these variances have come up
now, what is v 2 0 what is v 2 f l
similarly, 1 maybe, 2, 3, 4, a bottom 5 and so on
if it is a parabola, if it is in the vertical direction, is satisfies y minus k is equal to a into x minus h square
1 by phi value we got as no phi value we have not calculated we have calculated this lambda e value this lambda e value will be basically i i did a mistake 1
and you go through this a few times until you get something that the people who are going to use your product or your game in this case, really like and really want and at that point you might actually be able to sell your game to millions of people and become a billionaire and you know buy all of those wonderful things that you want it
so, it is 5 into 10 to the power minus 6, c value is given
now let us move on to another concept called network stability, here the circuit is stable if its impulse response is bounded, means the h t converses to the finite value when t tends to infinity and if it is unstable if s t grows without bounds s t tends to infinity
the id works on the pressure principle, the ego works on reality principle and the super ego works on the morality principle
5 volts if 5 millie amps is going through 500 oms
so, it will be using the internal internal memory, but after that it will be using the external memory once it finishes once it finishes this maximum address for example, in 8051 we have 4 kilo byte of internals memory internal rom
even at 4 percent chloride that is lower than the 3 percent chloride at 30 milli amps per meter square so it also depends on how quickly we apply the charge, so on the current density basically as to how successful we are going to be in stopping corrosion so that proved the idea of using a 2 stage cathodic protection method
so, the naoh side of the compartment is connected to the positive and nacl side is connected to the negative and the potential of about 60 volts is applied
now, let us ask a question if a cylinder or cone is placed on horizontal plane, how it looks like, what are the projections for the solid
so, accordingly you can set the timer value that for getting that delay
so, similar accounting happens in the case of two dimensions ok
so you can look at dc current as an equivalent per phase ac current in a 3 phase system
now it might be that the solution that we are trying to get does not work
so you cannot reduce the height, which is eight lambda by eleven lambda
well in this case infinity by infinity from i can do it in either way right
and therefore, this will result in ambiguity
so just by looking at the logic value you really cannot distinguish right
when i travel from 1 to 2
therefore, what will happen because of that a voltage e is equal to b into this the flux density b
this is positive but this is slightly positive and so if this is more positive the output will be still positive because as long as this is at higher potential, the output will be positive right
we can relate the charge density to the electric field; the equation is electric field e as a function of x is just 1, where is the permittivity of the material integral ρnet as a function of x d x
that is the reason why generally the parameter estimation of a transformer becomes extremely important, that tells you indirectly, internally how much the transformers is going to swallow and how much will you get at the output
remember, this delta z is very very small that is what makes its a hertz dipole, what approximation can i make over here, remember r over here is mod r minus r prime
formula here is because two weights are different, standard weight is different, actual weight is different
there may be some hand movements, certain postures, certain facial expressions which can be threatening and menacing
excellent you are look yoyou are looking at the y axis, look at the y axis it is changing right excellent,
if i apply a one at this input for an or gate, i have to apply a zero
so in our last lecture, if you recall, we were talking about pseudo random pattern generation and how we can use l f s r to generate the patterns for building such type of a circuits
if, that is the case can we draw it is projections and it is inclination angle with horizontal plane
so, the keys and so on are secure in spite of any malicious code that is present in the normal world system so even if your android or ios is compromised still the key is stored in the trusted environment is still safe and secure
if he has met quickly the western cultures will see it as a waste of time
so, i am going to have as i increase the load further and further, i am going to have reduction in the speed
25 then you realized that this moved up and the decimal position changed
so, what remains now of course, is i have got one equation in 5 variables and what would i do next
so, whenever we are taking that i 1 is equal to minus 6 means, the current actually 6 ampere current actually flowing in this direction, right
in the previous two examples, in the second example if the count comes out to be 11; so this is a positive error it is a like a the measured value is more 11 is greater than 10
whom do you pay dividend
so, that means alternatingly this equation you can write this, this equation other way that it is v t is equal to v s 1 minus e to the power minus t into u t
so, this is what a basic structure of the layout is
so as the job arrives, the scheduler code starts running and checks whether this is a task which has arrived needs to be executed by preempting the already executing task
so, once in all the three cases, once the brick is ready, the wet brick is ready, you go and fire the brick and in the firing phase and this is what imparts the strength to masonry, brick masonry
so, we can use our protractor to make 12 threes a
5% to 10%, commitment charges there for example if any firm exporter has enter into an agreement with the forfeiter that i will sell to x importer in your country
okay, these are examples of episodic memory and of course these were all examples we all know, because they were historic events from the history point of view
and this is this is your a n that means, your this voltage
so, number one, there is a difference in the actual time of labor and standard time of labor and the second or the first condition is that standard is also revised
trade payables were slowly going up down, again they have increased substantially
so, once again this is the conduction band, this is the valence band, this is e, this is k
for example the direct material cost is 50,000 rupees, labor cost is 10,000 rupees, and the overheads cost is 10,000 rupees
this is what skew and jitter, as i have talked about, they depict diagrammatically
primarily talking more and more about the id, ego and the super ego; the emphasis was on the unconscious part of the mind and then talking about the early life experiences
now, if you apply a voltage source here right so, voltage 1 voltage source suppose v 0 is given right and, this voltage source this voltage source v 0 is given; that means, at this point this voltage source is v 0 actually is equal to 1 volt, because your what you call, because low electrical elements connect here
we have one data array and the indicated top
now i have arrived at a solution where you cannot merge anything else any further
r d r
we understand that kinesics can send unlimited number of verbal signals, particularly when we consider that all of us can display more than a single behavior in any given instance
so, next is a 250 volt shunt motor has r a is equal to 0
another alternative is to make clflush accessible only through a system call
there also you see a drop earlier it was more than 100% then it became 90 and now it is 72, which means that lesser amount is now getting realized as a cash which is not a very positive value for the business
so you have to use molecules which allows the division, and then you have to
doctor john gottman studied couples and he has found that when he sees the contempt micro expression in his therapy office there is a very high rate of divorce
the last thing we did was to put the 7th queen right
he is the lord of the heavens, lord of the weather and that is what he does
so, but it is true for this particular circuit
so the first term coming back to this left hand side over a a is u 1 phi
so, when i etch sio 2 how can i etch sio 2
we can use high pass filter stage, we can use low pass filter stage, we can cascade both the stages
however, the value in a copyrighted work is regarded as an investment because, there is some amount of effort in time and material that goes into creation of these works
what is the best way of representing that, that is the whole objective of this surface construction
so, what if they say this visual looks cool we will proceed, but get it approved freeze the graphics; do not keep it till development
the reason is that line; overhead conductor to the ground there will be uniformly distributed, capacitance will be there
i am not really looking at it right now because it is open circuit
154
now as i said i have also connected an led
with c99, we have the introduction of what is known as const types, that are constants and we will have more discussions of that in depth when we do c++
so this is pretty much finishes the course
so, from outside if i go if i ask g of x at this point this will be an error, because it will say there is no such g defined
another method is that you can use simple algebraic method, which you generally use for solving the general expressions
so the induced emf is going to be i can write it as minus ea or this way or plus ear this way it is essentially d phi ar by dt multiplied by ofcourse number of turns blah blah all those things
we are going up to about 340 milli amps per meter square
but here the factory cost will include that part of light which is used, that part of the power which is used in the factory
we are calculating the variances of a problem which i can say it is a comprehensive problem dealing with different issues with regard to the material variances
they rather have the ship’s performance because in what times that will more critical than their maul of copper
so, i mean if it is the suppose if this air gap length increases, the fringing effect also will increase
you can find it in any electromagnetic textbook but what we will cover is the solutions of these maxwellõs laws
now, we assume that switch has been closed for a long time and it was just opened at time t equal to 0
we will do much more complicated calculations in this course, but let us just take a simpler wave example
the blue expresses a melancholy attitude and suggest depression
now, i understand that if you go by a hard core classification is the state of sadness which is being represented, but when i hear it, it does not give me a state of sadness which gets induced in it gives a different kind of peace, serenity
so, only the queen on row i actually attacks row i similarly only one queen is in column j
here only the number of object points is estimated
that is right, we are given under two heads that is the salaries, wages, commission
25 over 10 square 0
but whenever, ah, your what you call, when voltage v one will be there, we will make v m one, because sending end, receiving end, right, but when will take p square to q, square to where, will be replaced by m two
now these two capacitances can be outputs of your rectifier filter circuits
now another point is the melting point melting point of boat should higher than melting point of your metal correct right
to put it in specific terms, it states that accountant should not anticipate any income but shall provide for all possible losses
so, all of these assuming that you have a pointer to some type which is not known and, since you do not know the type while you actually want to do the comparison in the return statement of the compare function, you will have to first tell the compiler that, what indeed i now have is an integer
as the name implies, we are trying to verify something through physical inspection
75 in this case
so, now, it enters the bolt and we can see this see the threads uncovering one by one as the nut revolves into the bolt
that is what
i am neglecting the losses, so i am not writing the losses at all
so, note that distribution negatives are along the stroke path; so all the plus, minus signs are shown in this diagram
so these are the two basic equations to find out the h parameters
we will again show in this module that why global and member function solution for operator overloading fail in such cases and how the friend could help
essentially it would look at the hamming distance between the two and determine whether this response has actually originated from this specific device so in this way the edge device will be authenticated
wwhatever we learn in theory applied, is applied in some form and let us see in few lectures from after this particular module, how we are going to use the operation amplifiers and mosfets for the from the experiment point of view, all right
so there is one issue that arises here
we had already brought out the distinction between these 2 reports
please do not confuse between this v and this v
so it is not a great option if i am trying to start an induction motor which is probably coupled to a hoist, coupled to an electric vehicle or coupled to an elevator because those things require a high starting torque, whereas here the torque is going to be very very limited, i am not going to get a good amount of torque
from k point, pick another arbitrary point p such that ap is smaller than pk; so something like this is greater distance
let us try to first of all, look at the open circuit characteristics of a synchronous machine
awareness about context and cultural frameworks is equally important
after you compensate your probe, then and then only start using your oscilloscope, all right
now during this time d1 and d4 are conducting and other two diodes are conducting during this period d2 and d3 so basically this would form the diode currents and if you if you calculate if you draw the waveform for a in the input current this is the wave shape for during the positive half cycle and during the negative half cycle this would be in reverse like this now this is the wave shape for the input current
okay, so the first thing we need to do is find where libc is present
but in addition, rose has some additional properties that is why you would like to specialize that
we want to find this now
now, once the value of k i are known, we can easily find out the inverse laplace transform for f s
is the flux through it is the flux through dl in the normal direction, over here was in that the same interpretation is a flux of a
so, let us put that value v o r 1 plus v i r 2 divided by r 1 plus r 2; this has to be greater than 0
which formula will be applied here
so we see that the total solid volume that is to say this part plus this part is now roughly double the original solid volume we had at the beginning
i will not have the torque due to rotor side current because rotor side current zero and i will not have is ir into d is by d theta because i am not having ir at all,right
so this theta prime value, which is the value, what you have do plug into the stoneys equation and this will give you the force generated by the myotube
the first situation is when the actual weight of the mix first case when the actual weight of mix and the actual weight of the mix and the standard weight of the mix, do not differ
so, this is as far as tangential boundary conditions go the other
so if you are going to have actually the current flowing through the dc motor drive, which is inductive because la is there
46 into 16 into 10 into 410 by 1
but then if there are multiple tasks synchronization among the tasks you need to manage the memory, like memory demanding tasks, we need to store data in file, we need to network to other devices, we need graphics displays, we need to interface with a wide range of io devices, we need to have buffering of the io applications, security, power management, etcetera
one is your negative feedback, another one is your positive feedback
and it is very useful for the small scale industries especially for those firms who do not have a say desired credit rating and who are little say you can call it as uhhh not having a very good financial position in the market whom the banks sometime are reluctant to lend the funds
now you know, what areare band pass filters
so let us do that
there are instances where the universities can also file it internally, but it will require a different kind of a setup and different kind of professionals to do that
now, node is the network node of a network is defined as a point where two or more branches are joined
so, how to find it out right
namaste in last three sessions we have discussed a lot about financial statement analysis and its interpretations
payment for, payment for salaries, wages, commission and other variable expenses and other variable expenses
so, this particular example, we will use this example to estimate what the eccentricity is and then from the eccentricity arrive at what the design forces are going to be to the walls in the in plain direction
for this first test vector, or first test vector, t one is zero, one, zero, one zero
so, can we say when the field is not unique and set a example
if that information is given about the units produced and sold, then how to treat that
and now one this is some examples which we did it in our lab, you can see here the blue curve here is for opc concrete and then the red curve here is for the fly ash based concrete and then the black curves are for a new type of concrete which is made out of lc3 cement
for example, this is a member like a r e components of a complex number i m component of a complex number or so, i would need to read and set the value of this component if i am reading a complex number
so, might a what beam as sent through it, but in optics particularly they are there are non linearity
i understand that this is not exactly equivalent to the radius but assuming that it is a big circle
so i am going to have xs value to be really really large
so means that we have to convert first this circuit into laplace domain that is s domain
but the point is to understand the systematic method so that if you have to do it, you have to be able to go through all the possibilities systematically, you have to consider all the possibilities systematically and eliminate all the wrong ones
as a second example, i will take a heat of charge in the x y plain carrying a current, let's say in the y direction, surface current
around the x axis you see the years starting from nineteen seventy up to two thousand fifteen, which is shown here
so, what you can do you can arrange them in such a way that it looks like there are 3 different voltage sources
now, in finding the curl of h, we know that the point dipole is placed at the origin, r equal to zero
similarly, if i leave out the last position it runs to the end of the string
i want to plot the strength of this magnetic field as a function of time ok
there are methods like breuers algorithm and some modification, terminal propagation, and there are some other methods also: cluster growth, force directed also
but then at port 3, where constructive interference happens, there there is addition of power
again, we have seen in the theory class how we can understand what are the phases, right
this is already given here
so each of this rough connections and actually map to horizontal and vertical segments
whatever is a portion related to loss of machinery that will be considered as a cash inflow due to investing activity
and what is the gross profit
so you do not have enough space to keep e either to the right or left
application of the marginal costing as a technique of costing, very useful technique of management decision making has to be applied here for the different applications which i told you that those different applications if you talk about here the applications of marginal costing which we discussed in the previous class all these decision making process fixation of selling price buying or make or buy decision key or limiting factor effect of change in the selling price so and so forth we will be now learning some basic concepts of the market costing which will be useful in say taking the different decisions in the different market situations
and if we can layout this kind of a network, we shall see later how we can have a very regular layout of the clock tree which can ensure the equalization of not only the buffer delays but also the delays of the interconnections, so that way you can ensure your overall delay will be means equalized and skew will be minimized
lets look at some of the existing methods which have been proposed for this net weighting, how they how they make the estimates
now if r v is very high then this current will be almost equal to 0 and this current according to current divider rule this is i multiplied by r v divided by r v plus r x
so various appliances will have their own current level
there is another format of observation what is called as subjective observation
so let me also label these this is g1, d1 and s1 meaning that they are gate drain and source of the most transistor m1
the kids do not figure this out, i doubt that but anyway the assumption is that and they are able to open by only adults who figure this out is pressing on top and opening it
and these two dots are here, this is basically the neutral zone right
you said you write notes regularly, so do you refer those notes while you prepare for the exam
what about the entire x axis sorry the entire y axis
it takes a binary number in as a input and gives a continuous output
as before we can directly translate this into an inductive into a recursive program
we checked up the total, you can call it as the number of hours
so, now have got another equation first is this equation, second you have got from the kirchhoff current law
do we know how to integrate over a special kind of triangle, supposing i give you a unit triangle ok
so, our vertical plane now looks like this
so, when we connected here the voltage increases and when we connected here the voltage decreases
now we will be mainly dealing with the second type of photo detectors, where your photons generate electron hole pairs
so, we say that this is 4 not because we did plus 3 because s is not equal to b, we did 4 because we got the max value from here, why is this 4 again i is not equal to s
2 right 118
sir, in coordinates we have r theta and phi right this is 2 d polar coordinates; you are thinking of 3d cylindrical 3d spherical coordinates where there is a r theta and phi but this is just a 2 d problem, so there is no phi yeah
it has many cement plants there because it has rich limestone deposits
and, this one what we call front view and this one top view
so, let us say that 1 function ft we have and we are associating 1 direct delta function with it
if we are drawing that will be 20 mm and 30 mm in front of vertical plane
it is 2 less than t and other this way you can when t greater than 2 right
this is just for purpose of general knowledge will not study that
and also the teaching and learning activities should be designed such that they facilitate effective achievement of those learning outcomes and subsequent assessment tasks
so in this session, we discussed about the network synthesis in detail and also carried out our discussion on network stability
manusov and patterson have reflected on the potentially important eye behavior for teachers which they have termed as the “teacher stare” and we often use it to manage the students class room behavior
let so, you do not find
so, you have to write wrapper that will correctly read in the data in a pass the coma whatever all of that
and when is it large when vd is large and positive when i say large and positive vd must be much more than the thermal voltage
similar exercise can be done with the help of converting cos into sign and then comparing with the voltage v2
so, for that problem what we have done
so, now when it is switching on it is a value has given 10 volt, v t right, it is a 10 volt
so this again it is like the same process of design thinking applying itself into this evolution of the product concept within itself
so, in this mechanical system we have one motor connected to a load through shaft which has the friction coefficient as we will rather say stiffness coefficient as k which defines the torsional spring coefficient
and also we do not have many vocational rehabilitation centers and things like that; even i see people with dementia, a psychologist will sit and make them a home based plan which is half understood, half not understood; the people because of their financial thing are unable
so, if you see the figure you will see that the flow of current is opposite to the direction of flow of electrons
and python being a simple language to start working with and to use and itõs nice built in things like dictionaries and stuff like that, exception handling, are done in a very nice way, so it makes it very attractive to learn
what is the position
in general, when we do insertion sort we will find that we need to sort things a segment of the list
now 1st of all creating this bit fault is extremely difficult and furthermore we would require 128 such bit falls to completely extract the secret key of aes
so, create, report, detect, handle, and recover are the basic five stages through any exception can be handled
now, here today we will be understanding what exactly an inverting amplifier is
so these are two types of construction depending upon where i cannot tolerate more reluctance i have to adopt this construction, shell type construction, right
if the armature carries current, it is definitely going to throw its own spanner into the entire field of things, so i am going to have some variation in the flux, in the form of something called armature reaction
remember earlier, when i was discussing this, this formula, i had said that in the continuous distribution, this row r d, v, integrated over smaller and smaller volume
the distance between drain to source is the length and the width of this region through which the current flows that is the width w
by rotating it so, that i will get a b 2 then transfer that a b 2 all the way up, then extend this line get this one, this will be the true length
so, this we will analyze when we'll discuss about convolution integral
after calculating this gp, this gp comes here by gp now, this amount of 30,000 will come here
the system of equations accepts it only at gamma in the total field formulation
so, what really the basis of this experiment is very interesting to see how the physical behavior under compression and shear has then been nicely translated to an analytical form, idealized into an analytical form
once you calculate i b plus, i b minus, you have to take the difference of i b plus and i b minus, and then again you see some mode some mode
therefore, your equivalent circuit say this is r 1 and x 1
and there is a load z2 z0 connected
so lets say one of them is v a and v b
when he approach the tto with a view to commercializing his discovery; he was surprised to learn that they were not interested
the other thing which is little more technical which we will
so, therefore, there is no output, but the next certainly what will get constructed is the holder
however, the reflected waves will come back only at 2 double dash, this we had already discussed you know while discussing the applications of couplers, we had covered this topic earlier
so, i can design the circuit as i found the value of the resistors thus i can design this particular circuit which is shown in the bottom right given the particular values which is the value of the cutoff corner frequency and the value of the capacitance
so the next system that we look at is gate to gate meaning we consider the processes within the gate, within the control of the cement plant only we take into account all direct raw material energy requirements for making the cement all the emissions that are occurring within the cement plant including the extraction and transportation of limestone which is the major impact and we also look at the emissions due to the fuel used in the electricity production also
so, the phase current lag behind their corresponding phase voltage by theta
similarly, by rotating that in that direction normal to the plane, we will get right side view
so, if i calculate the cutoff frequency or break point frequency f c; so, fc formula we can directly write one upon 2 pi r c or one by 2 pi r c for a simple passive; passive high pass filter consisting of capacitor c equals to one micro farad
0097 per unit megawatt
so, good conductors such as copper and aluminum have low resistivity
so in this way we have seen how malloc is managed internally with various arenas, heaps, chunks and various types of bin
5 multiplied by the lower bound and the upper bound values in the previous slide
but here i am going to just do a little manipulation
04 times 10 to the 17
but it is quite important for you guys to know that, if i try to start a dc motor with full supply applied to the armature without any resistance, extra resistance included in the armature circuit, the current is going to be enormously high, because the starting current in the case of a dc motor
so, when you talk about the integrator, it performs the function of integration that is why in the starting of the op amp lectures, i told you the operational amplifier can be used to solve the mathematical functions
that means, percent r that is speed regulation r is equal to percent frequency change divided by percent power output change into 100 this is the equation 1
the beauty of the formulation based on strain is that the same set of expressions hold right from the first stage full compression to the last stage where it is going to be fully in tension where depending on the geometry possibly all the four bars are have be yielded or few bars are yielded and few bars have not yielded
then point p is at a height m above ; that means, that height above we will see it in the vertical plane
in our last lecture, if we recall, we talked about two techniques: gate sizing and buffering, introducing buffering interconnection lines
so i need to give them some simple tool and that is a mini slump, so do a mini slump flow right so we have rheological parameters
but you also have an entire network of connecting elements which are the bond beams and the lintel beams
positive means if our inflow is more than the outflow, so we have a positive balance
so, i will have one primary 220 volts, one secondary 220 volts, from the primary i may supply the voltage, from the secondary side i make connected to some motor or load or rectifier or whatever
then we move to the next step: i equal to two, starting with the cells which are marked as on
but i get lot of teenagers from school to even to institute like iit and medical college and all
so, we will see it like a rectangle
selling price is same that is 105 in the market for example
if you i mean based in this assumption you substitute those your s max t your s max t your what you call your expression, you put r thevenin 0 and s thevenin 0 you will get s is equal to s max t is equal to r 2 dash upon x 2 dash
why it is important because sometimes in the circuit if it is given a the figure is given in a different way you can better convert it into a similar type of a circuit where it is very easy to analysis the current flow and the voltage drop across the element
so laplace transform is capable of providing us the total response of the circuit, which comprising of both the natural as well as forced responses and that comes in one single operation
i am going to have something like this, so here probably iara drop at this point is really not as large as what i am getting here, here it is larger whereas here this is going to be slightly smaller, so it comes in the decreasing direction
so, thank you very much and in the next class we will learn more about this projection of solids
so this is the problem here
then for s, the str now points to nothing
c 3 is 0
we will come back and examine the same situation but with motor strengths different from the unit strengths as shown here and then examine how we go into a situation where inelastic behavior of the motor can give us a much better prediction of the mechanical behavior under compression
now, resistance depends upon the dimensions of the sample, so if you have a thinner material or if you have a wire with a smaller diameter, then the resistance is higher
earlier the signal was passing through the resistor, and the capacitor was placed here in the low pass filter
95 right and suppose after placing capacitor you got 1
now this i can write as f dx
this r square r phi gives me a r cubed here
yeah that is what i said it is my choice it is not a coming from physics or math it is a choice the convention, once i fix it, but then i have to be consistent with the rest
then in 1967, 1967 we got the first op amp which looked like this which currently also we are using the same operation amplifier mu a741 by fairchild by fairchild
the potential is the same on this entire surface and gradient is always gradient of b is perpendicular to equipotential surfaces
many of you may have seen this simplification in your undergrad em course that for a plane wave i can replace this del cross by just a minus j k vector i just gave you the intuition for it, but you can drive it rigorously yourself ok
this particular topic we are starting now is called multi why, also popularly known as 5 whys
so, this is what we will look at, but is the general idea clear
so, line voltage means is equal to root 3 times phase voltage angle 30 degree
however, for the k greater than 1, now for unconditional stability we saw that we need k greater than 1 and delta modulus lesser than 1
in order to understand paralanguage we have to understand different signs associated with it and these are volume of voice speed of voice etcetera
so here what we could see
now due to the conflicts that arise due to the common cache and the agreed upon cache sets, the conflicts may actually cause certain memory accesses to be faster and certain memory access to be slower
how do you arrive at the loading based on the intention to reduce the moment that can act on the joint itself
on the other hand list2 and list3 are equal precisely because they points to the same value, there is exactly one list in to which they are both pointing
this is freely available
let me tell a few things about this course before we say goodbye to you
but the important thing is, changing the private implementation should not affect how the functions behave in terms of input and output
the other input will be coming from the logic inside the decoder
this exactly what we are doing in the recursive call, we are saying pretend we are computing gcd of that
you know, for example, there is a birla group
so, during the fabrication of these transistors and gates, that could be multiple different ways, one cmos inverter differs from another cmos inverter
in this experiment, we will read the sensor values and depending on that an alarm system will be activated
so, this is similar phenomena; here it is positive, positive, here it is; the cloud is negative
there can have three different constants of proportionalities kp, ki and kd, and you generate a consolidated control signal for the process you are trying to control
basically, these consists of a set of design rules which the designer must follow in a religious way
the point is i know how to make a tea, and you probably would know how to make a tea as well
there is an access point that has been placed here, and this access point is providing connections between the these producers, rabbit i mean producers, broker and the consumer
among the registers this pc is one register which will be pointing to the address of the next instruction in the program memory
similarly, the conductivity will also increase, because the carrier concentration increases
now next thing he has to do is he has to apply 5v peak to peak to the input of the non inverting amplifier or into the input of the filter
so, now we can see you can see this pin to be moving while this slot remains fixed
and till now we have discussed that how the budgeting and the budgetary exercise helps the firms to arrive at certain decisions where we learned about that we can prepare the operating budget and we can prepare the financial budgets
let say we have an n bit adder, which where constructing by cascading n one bit adders
so it becomes one zero, one, one one that is z
so, 1 line from there we draw a parallel line similarly from point 2 we are going to draw a parallel line from 3 4 5 6 again from 7 8 and so on we repeat all the way to this point p
so, you may revisit this video after study potentiometer
so, at this node if you apply the kirchhoff current law first thing is that the at this particular node current going outside is 2 of i x, another current going outside is v naught by 4, another current going outside of this node is v naught by 2 and then the current going inside is the current i naught, right because the direction of current i naught is in this direction so this will become minus or you can simply say this all equal to 1
so, that way you are satisfying the customer that he thinks you have not touched him but you’ve still got your measurements
and therefore you are looking at a quantitative approach to arriving at the strengthening strategy
he wrote a bunch of scientific papers and everybody was happy with this
and we wrote 2 portions of the resistance, one we wrote as r2 dash which is the inherent resistance of the rotor transformed into the stator side and we wrote one more portion of the resistance which represents the mechanical power which we showed as a variable resistance, which is r2 dash by s multiplied by 1 minus s right
here if it is plus minus, so plus tip means this arrow one earlier i told you, so it is upward
you can see in two years there is about 10% increase in their sales revenue from operations from 39 crore to 43 crore
that is supposed a 30 volt voltage is applied across a resistor of resistance 5 kilo ohm
no, repository should have only that one content
okay, i'll try to respond to your question
so, this is in sequence, it is multiplying y by 1 then the result by 2 then the result by 3 and so on
we find that a lot of people normally adopt this position while they are is standing, particularly those people who are not in a position of a leader
so, it is like integrating a double delta function, i can integrate it once i mean like if i integrate it once i do not get anything finite, but if i integrate it twice
so, it is taken as rms value, and this this is resultant one, it is 13
any activity which cannot fall in financing or investing but there is a cash movement is also included because it is a residuary head known as operating activity
i broke up this into segments and applied a method of moments over here on each of the segments ok
so this is the magnetic field
we will take a silicon, this everybody should know now
the advantage to we achieve with this is that a large portion of the ram gets saved
you can easily estimate the time to develop that is t
the only difference is that this voltage is not constant with respect to transistor parameters
affiliative, initiating, abstract, directing and affiliative, initiating, abstract, informing, like vise 4 4 combinations are there
such activities motivate the learners to reflect on their own knowledge structure and how they can build on what they know
so, this is going to be i am adding this guy and this guy i am going to actually get a line
this, as we said, requires us to cycle through all values of x, y, and z in that range
so, i will show that that circuit diagram where z s and z r represent internal source impedance and impedance connected to the end of the line
so, that means, if you put like this, your theta is equal to omega t that is 2 pi n t omega is angular velocity radian per second, then your what you call, then this equation that
we are not going to borrow anything now
so, every business requires some form of investment and enough customers because you need people to buy your stuff to whom, its output can be sold on a consistent basis, in order to make profit
the for loop terminates normally it means we have run through every possible c that was available and for none of them did we return true; that means, that there is no way to currently put a queen on row i given the board that we have
like earlier take the average if you want it at some other point interpolate so, the choice is up to you, but once you fix one everything else gets fixed question
so let us say we sense it, appropriately amplify it or attenuated and bring it to a compar amplifier
so, this is equation 59, 60, 61 and 62
so here we take it as the first of all, honors equity
so, it is 0, but except at t is equal to t 0
that means, suppose project a depends project b
why i am writing g of r
we can open a file in one of three modes; read, write and append
in the loan part loan is also sanction amount and is sanctioned for the borrower for meeting the short term requirements at certain rate of interest
and, join a to b to get true length
we have seen in the paper pencil format, we have seen the computer assisted formats; now if you look at the current trend you say for example, let us take the research which are based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging for instance
so now you can say that by successive implementation of source transformation in the circuit, you can simplify the network and find the value of vx very easily
so, in the first part, we want to calculate the room temperature conductivity
now, the association of university technology managers – autm, lists out four reasons for public research organizations to advance technology transfer
now if you look at the rating for q1 or q2, see the vceo rating for either q1 or q2 is should be greater than 2 times vin
some other newspapers reported that the computer in the pathfinder was trying to do too many things at once and therefore was failing and so on
r prime is varying over the entire v 2, but entire v 2, were split up into pulses
now, because this capacitance will lie in parallel
we will give you the y t is equal to h t
when i look at this side ok so, this is the equation and i want to look at this term ok
so, once you have the budget for the purchase, raw material and the operating expenses, so you put together all these things and finally means you know that how much we are going to sell, how much we are going to say invest for those sales and when you put all these things in a profit and loss account, right, when you put all this in a profit and loss account, this gives you the statement which is called as the, say, your budgeted profit and loss account
and, but then the way you interact with the person who still struggles with himself or herself where, the challenge is more for the person who is suffering from alzheimer; rather than those who are just giving care
so, we have the dc we have the multimeter here, and he will connect it to the dc power supply
so talked about 15 to 20 times the cost because these materials are proprietary and they use very special admixtures and the additives
so d dielectric material is going to be d equal to k, epsilon zero, e, a, sometimes write it as e, epsilon e, where epsilon is the permittivity of that material
now, in order to compute i comma j, i need to pick a k, and i need to compute for that k all the values i mean i have to compute i k, and so it turns out that this corresponds to saying that if i want to compute a particular entry i comma j, then i need to choose a good k
so, i, either, so this is my meter it has an resistance of 100 ohm
now, receiving inside the reflection factor is rho r; that means, this reflection value multiplied by rho r, rho r into v f right
because of the bond and because of equilibrium, the unit now starts experiencing tensile stresses
grad g
if you are using a very small application, a small embedded system which hardly has a operating system, then the priority inheritance protocol is the one to use
dynamic cast does not work with objects; it is used only with pointers and references to classes
so, private very strongly relates to implementation public strongly relates to interface
recall that this gave us the magnetic with the electric field inside the shell as minus sigma zero over three, epsilon zero, a constant electric field, and outside it was like a dipolar field with a dipole movement, p, whatever that comes out to be now
and each of this k resources is used by several of the lower priority tasks
because of this there will be additional transitions, additional charging and discharging taking place, or the load capacitor, so this means additional power dissipation
what is wrong with this
second, one is vertical constraint, so means there is no horizontal over lap, there is no dependency in v, c, g, then only you can possibly merge them in a single track
however, as we know that we i have imported this ball for the first and then the this plane
suppose this is our line of text which i will call csv line it is a sequence of values separated by commas notice it is a string
so, from this power factor you can find out also is reactive power absorb right load reactive power also because power factor is given
now we can say one f and two s
for vdd, y coordinate is two, zero come two
the duration of these liabilities maximum can be for a period of 12 months, whereas in this case we are finding they are only valid for or their life is maybe for a month or maybe a quarter or something like that
so what we'll be doing in this is: given a situation, take a path, depending on if it depends only on the cylindrical coordinate s i'll take a circular path or, depending on the situation, some other path
you must have studied this already you must have seen what is complex notation, what is phasor diagram, and how the power is measured and so on
in south korea, elders can touch younger people particularly when they are trying to get through a crowd etcetera, however it is considered to be very crowd if a younger person touches an elderly person in the same manner
now, when we say the value of an ac voltage if we say not if you do not mention anything else it by default means the rms value ok; in case of ac by default we always mean rms value
write up is here that is a different that is that you read later but just listen
so one thing i would like to ask is why material science is important
we said that when a particular time t is equal to 0 the circuit is closed then this particular phenomenon can be equivalently represented as a voltage source with 1 step function combined and then the rc circuit
besides, there is a lot of interesting physics happening over here
so, this is our estimate and this is the true value ok
we see there is silicon substrate and there is silicon dioxide
bug and extremely exploited by various different malware and viruses over the last decade or actually more than a decade and one of the first viruses that actually use the buffer overflow was the worm called codered which was released on july 13th 2001
note the display is a member function so the name of the display function is actually list colon colon node, so i am writing here as i am sorry, the name of the member function is display and the full name is list colon colon display
the one hurdle which one would probably face while trying to go this is that the stack segment may actually overflow for instance because this is from the second function which is invoked soon after main
but you should understand that the capacitance had zero voltage and therefore zero charge
it depends on the type of devices and the way they are sending you the inputs
now once again observe, v n is almost equal to 0 which is same as v p, v p is 0
so, that it is extremely relevant for the learners for whom we are designing this content and finally, we need to design the activity
so if we consider the ground to gate system which again is everything from the mine to the gate of the plant so we get the quantities how much is required for a kilogram of clinker later on we look at 1 ton of clinker but these are all the materials that will be required
have we actually ended up at the last node and deleted the last node
so, when i am looking at a linear system of equations then, what is the most convenient way of studying time of frequency
in this case this periodic signal is v, so the output which we get from here is vrms and this value is equal to vm by root 2 and vm is the peak value of the signal
if i know the axial force corresponding to the average level of axial stress, i will be able to estimate, okay, so i am somewhere there, i can go and estimate that the axial, the shear capacity of the wall is so much kiloons and the failure is expected to be in diagonal cracking
printf function will print the appropriate message
suppose, this is my star connected source and this is my star connected load right
so again a star, this and this, and the other side, eight and seven, where horizontal line, and this again with the vertical line
so, the values of e are given h is given everything else is a constant
we notice that 12 and 10 are not correctly ordered
so, the current equations enhance the voltage equations may be written at each principal node of a network with exception of reference node
so, we can use this processor for doing this things; we can say that we can put the power down we cannot required the operations we can put it in power down mode and later on or in the idle mode and whenever the this service is required we can turn on the device or turn on the services; so, this is a power control example
now we are neglecting i 0 right
this whole thing is a scalar corresponds to rs
now, with this, we will go to major form of analysis that is known as ratio analysis
in the earlier modules, what have we seen
if you specify epsilon i will find you a p which approximates, this function very well over here
you can change the phase of the signal by changing the by giving any value that you want to give
your entire budgeting team or the variance analysis team has to sit down
so, in that case every time you find out every time you increase this take this value for all the loads, for all loads you load is increasing you increase uniformly to all the loads assuming that load growth load growth is there just just to test it right
a gsm modem is required; we have used sim900a gsm modem, which is used to communicate with the microcontroller from a mobile phone using sms
in region i my variable is the what is my variable scattered total or incident
so, if you look at it, the number of careers per atom, if you do the division you will find that you have 1 electron or 1 hole for every 10 to the 11 atoms and this turns out be really small
so, when see over here r m is being held constant right; so, this
then i am going to start a machine, speed is zero, so the slip will be one right
so this shows that incase of three phase system, we need considerably less material to deliver the same power when we compare with the three phase system and the single phase system
so, it is minus m d i 2 upon d t right
so, if we are drawing the front view turns out to be this one comes there
86 angle 126
as i move as far as possible, i mean as close as possible to the service, i will be able to ask what the boundary condition is
one form a problem solving where the organism develops sudden insight, the individual suddenly understands what could be the possible solution in very case
in this case, length of the wall is 4
in fact this is a case where the load resistance does not affect the input resistance
this was initially actually the three phase configuration was initially introduced by tesla, it was invented by tesla and he had made the induction motor sometime in 1890’s or something, so induction motor design had not changed until day, it is almost remaining the same ever since 1890
so, accessing this data is basically accessing this data which by rule is not accessible to anyone else
the most important is they have got voting right
we have seen it in our discussion of the fixed space also that a particular architectural design passes on a particular message and therefore, we find that it is also considered as a silent language through which people put across their attitudes feelings and even judgments about other people
this is the kind of thing that we are going to see in a power station
one way is to use a simulation or game based environment which we have seen earlier, but what is important here is to provide an activity where the learner directly applies the abstract or scientific or formal knowledge in the realistic scenario present in the game or experiment or the simulation experiment
let us revisit what we lean by a data structure
so once an event occurs, then we start counting the time and we say that before certain time the result must be produced
if you do not have a webcam then you can have a student who comes in and measures the position of the drop at regular intervals but that is not quite so convenient
so, voltage and current when i specify very clearly in a motor it is going to indirectly talk about the input
so m ah, n is in the same direction as s in the cylindrical coordinates and s cross z gives you minus phi and therefore n cross m with a minus sign is nothing but m phi
so, what it is doing its, you sort of take it over the ground and collect the scattered fields and then you solve the mathematical problem assuming you have not being blown up already, to get what is the permittivity as a function of space
minimum number of views is always be good
second one is the faraday's law
so, m is actually m 1 2 is equal to m 2 1 right
in this case the p is a pointer to a b object, in the case on right hand side b is pointer to the d object
same as this, which is same as 5 counts of the different signal; so 5 times t r ok
in the previous lecture we had actually looked at an introduction to fault injection attacks and we had seen a very simple fault injection attack on the rsa public key cipher
let us take this direction to be z
9 for the value of a into size is 10 to the power the exponent factor is 1
so, note that if there is a cache miss, then the execution time will be high, on the other hand if a cache hit occurs then the execution time during the reload phase would be much lower
that is why third important statement was introduced around in 1995, that is known as cash flow statement
so, you see these points one is vminus, another one is vplus; now what can i see, vminus equals to vplus, how, because current into the opamp is 0 or because of the virtual ground concept, v1 is equal to v2 or vminus equals to vplus
now, finally, we have the difficult case which is you want to delete a node which is in the middle of the tree, in case this case 37
the inheritance related inversion in that sense does not occur here because as soon as a task acquires a resource its priority value does not change
only thing i have to make sure this that if this is dot, this is also dot then only i can mark them at the beginning and end
this condition ensures that the output voltage here v0 would be the same as replacing c2 by a short circuit
so many things are written here, but whatever i am telling meaning is same right
whereas in induction machine i cannot afford to increase the air gap because the more i increase the air gap the leakage will increase, the power factor will become worse and worse
it is possible to give constructive and customized feedback in e learning either using automatically graded tools such as differentiated feedback in multiple choice questions or using descriptive performance rubrics
so, we do not need this explicit not equal to 0, because the value m percent n if it is not 0 is treated as true and the loop will go one more time, but now in some situations it may or may not be so easy read this
so, we will just put that aside for now
however, quite likely he will not find such a sequence of instructions present completely in one function
sir, in front of me that there is heavy flash on the road and a light flash and there was a lightning stroke on the road, i said it never happen in front of you; at least 500 to 1 kilometer away
5 into 10 to the power minus 3 joules ; that means, the energy balance is not there; that means, some 50 percent of the energy is missing then where that energy has gone right that is that is why this problem i have taken that where that energy has gone
and this network which is there between the generator and the transistor is called the input matching network
prior to that these are again straightforward things
so, this is called a inverting type schmitt trigger
is this equation correct or are we off by a sign
now, we have that j point on the circle, connect p point and j point to construct a tangent line
when addition you have a net list which tells you that which pin is getting connected to which other pin
so, you grabs it and this is in the direction of the current you grabs the coil and this in the direction of the current and thumb you will indicate your direction of the flux
this part we will observe it in that way and there will be a middle line
at the point you are actually trying to move when you are moving you are going to see a variation in the current instantaneously
even if a task set is will meet its deadline but it may violate the liu leyland condition
basically you can disconnect it and then again you can connect it
so, that z m which is the centre of this segment you put in this value all other places you put 0 that is it very simple to apply ok
so, b object internally has an a object which is the base object
25 for field fabrication whereas for bearing type also this is 1
longitudinal bars again, how many bars, four bars and at what spacing should the stirrups be provided
for example, here that rectangular portion we have a smooth corners
so, a suffix that cannot be incremented is one which is as large as it could possibly be which means that it is already in descending order
so benefits which can be measured
so i have shown some typical interconnections
in any interpretation of touch context is critically important and the workplace is a somewhat unique setting for tactile interaction, because of harassment concerns which have caused many managers to fear any type of touch with their subordinates
so, i if i join this one, and i join this one, what i will i have
so, this is the centre of that ellipse 2 foci we always be going to have from v to f and o is centre
now, one thing i want to caution you this idea of what is called transverse magnetic and what is called transverse electric, you will find two different conventions in the literature
so, the circuit we should use to measure a low resistance is this
should we be testing pastes
7 volts and id0 is obtained from circuit analysis
it is equal to 10 t e into the power minus 5 t and the inductor value is 0
with uniform velocity, if this helicopter is moving; if it releases a packet, it comes in parabolic format, and finally this is the origin
so, now, we will check this linear coupler
actually at time t is equal to 3 second and actually idea is like this, this graph is like this
you could either show position for a long period, uninterrupted period of time, or you could bring evidence of title to show that a bill or a received or something of a similar nature to show that or the fact that you received it as a gift from someone else
in case of ii vi, the main bonding is ionic, so there is some covalent character in them
2 is the magnetizing effect and 0
so, now if you come to this average and rms values of a sinusoidal voltage or a current
5 ohms, so it is resistance load, if i have assumed 5
suppose i have a, some operation to do, say so, i am multiplying two numbers, b and c, and i added to d
then the student has to get constructed and student is specialising from person
the common way of connecting the inputs are to use two voltage sources
so, this is a picture that you had seen earlier
base class 2 has a member function h and the derived class introduces a member function h with the different signature
here, what you should look for is the exchange name, which is the topic underscore logs, and you should look at that type, which is actually the exchange type is called a topic, what you should really look out for, which we actually mentioned at the producer side when tejaswini was showing the demonstration
plane by definition is a two dimensional object
then, using both these objects the lifetime continues
that means, there has to be an association between the name of the object and the address that i am using for that object in the memory
similarly, we check for off conditions, there are various possibilities
actual yield is given to us and the actual yield is let us go back to the case and try to find out what is actual yield
now at the fermi level e equal to e f, f of e is always one half; does not matter what the temperature is the probability of occupation is always half
hi, welcome to this particular module and in this module, we will see another kind of oscillator
and similarly at node 2 if you apply kcl, then your because this current is incoming and these 2 are outgoing at and at node 2 your i 2; i 2 and i x entering into the node 2 and this i 4 is leaving
so, this is the way the current flows and if you want to continue this line further this will flow like this
the overlapping zone between the two ellipses is what is represented here in brown called g
the impedance can be defined in various ways
it means there is something fishy about the material usage variance
at that time, that is in year 1617, it was headed by arundati bhattacharya
suppose the voltage source vs is 12 volt in this circuit and we have to find out the value of current i0 flowing through 4 ohm resistance when voltage is 12 volt and when voltage is 24 volt
now, when i zoom in i am primarily interested looking within the individual
so, this shows us that these our polynomials are indeed orthogonal and what remains for us to do is to evaluate this integral using let us say three different methods
major group is a controlling owner
so, it is 1 to 2 it is given 1 to 4 ampere, then what will be i to 21 it will just opposite know it will be minus 4 because this current actually moving like this, when you take this current is coming like this i 12 and, but when you take reverse a direction that i 21 it will be minus 4 ampere
so, all i did was take this term here and then bring e down
make sure to do this configuration prior to using coolterm
there is a lot of research which is going on to find actually new pufs such as analog pufs, pufs using sensor and so on
let us try to see whether it is really true eventually
we will go to mate to advanced mate, then here we have linear coupler
you could also see what happens here and what is the gate pulses which are given to the switch
so, f of r prime goes in because the operator only acts on the unprimed coordinates right
we have to calculate b tot, so b total
let us click that perimeter circle and see what it is doing
so i am at a point here which is s phi and z, and its position is given by vector r, which is s s plus z z
503 electron volts
so, that is why here also it is written, that your v 1 plus that is v is equal to v 1 plus v 2 that is total voltage
so, self weight of the wall is one of the dead loads that you have to consider
further increase in eccentricity one will be going to get a hyperbola; infinite eccentricity is the vertical line or this straight line
our approach was by using coordinate stretching; coordinate stretching was interpreted as a anisotropic absorber ok
what we want to know is how the contact potential changes when we change the material
similarly whenever these threads bolts nuts and other kind of things are involved, we usually go with depth of the drilled hole for example, for this object inside there is a hole in which you have a thread
nobody has taken extra care, nobody has performed extra, nobody has found out anything special or done something extra or made any extra efforts
you can see that the volume expansion is 2
so here i have made just that change which checks whether the applied input and the current output are same or not
9; so, 20 kilovolt ampere
now, what is a share swap
so, let us put this together and then do a plot of the conductivity versus one over temperature
so, this part i told you i q if you made i q is equal to i c then your what you call this ah your this part will remains same this may be 0, but this part will almost unchanged
now let's proceed looking at how are these frames decided frame duration and how are tasks assigned to the frames
so, here we have taken one example
money can be borrowed and repaid in multiple of, multiples of $500
once it is done, we make a arc 3 point arc from that point to that point with certain radius
so, that is why v 1 is equal to minus e 1 plus your i 1 r 1 plus j your i 1 x 1, that is why this phasor diagram, this phasor diagram your what you call this phasor diagram is v 1 is equal to your minus e 1 i 1 r 1 plus your j i 1 x 1 this is the this one
so, this is what we call an unlimited life intellectual property
so what do we mean by sensitizable
so, i mean these are the wave vectors and they correspond to e to the j k dot r
so, this is the means as per the extent limits are the guidelines for practically banks are looking at the comparative use of the funds
similarly now we go for the march
so, when now if you remember again from the manual criteria we have sigma a where there is a reduction in the compression level and sigma b where there is an increase in the compression level we are going to be looking at sigma b to define what the failure criterion is when sigma b reaches the uniaxel compressive strength of masonry, fu, you have failure established
it is when we use or in english we usually mean either the first thing will happen or the second thing will happen, but not both, but in computer science and logic or is a so, called inclusive or not exclusive, its not exclusively one will happen or the other, but inclusive both may happen
now, we can compute fibonacci of 4 is 2 plus 1 3
so, if i plug in a value of r belonging to v 1, can i what is the problem with this equation
so, boundary tangential boundary conditions automatically satisfied ok
then it construct 3d object
so, we will fix the local edges what remains is global edges right
so this, this balance in the in the two vertical components, make the string up and down
so we know that magnetic field b inside a superconductor is zero
so, if you see the screen the screen shows the data sheet for lm 741, it is also called single op amp or single operational amplifier
so what we did is we separated all these aggregates to different sizes because you really have to pack them well, you separate them into different sizes and then you use what is called the compressible packing model
so if i try to actually draw, again the magnetization characteristics for these two distances
either it can distribute profit into the owners, then it will not come in the the balance sheet but most of the good companies do not distribute whole of the profit they may give part of the profit to the owner and remaining profit is plowed back into the balance sheet plowed back means instead of distributing it is kept with the company and in the balance sheet it appears as a reserve
now you come along tomorrow and say no i want integrate g of x, where g is some different function
8 into 10 to the power 9 millimetre square 4 right so this is the izz general root now if we put the value in this formulae i can find out the shear stress so if i put this value shear stress will be will become v into ay bar 1600 into ay bar was calculated as 900
so, that is why inside
so, that means that if you take out the capacitor and find the value of thevenin resistance, that would be sufficient to find the time response of the circuit
so, that is what we look at next
so, this time in this value, this is this value actually this is the value, this is o d, this is that your this is your o d this, portion this portion right
okay, so what are these reactions that lead to the formation of products that are causing harm to the concrete
the second type of a gaze is the social and the friendly gaze, it is also a nonthreatening gaze, but it is slightly more released in comparison to the business gaze
whenever i say this will send some data, it will receive some data; this will send some data, and it will receive that data
so this is going to be e times two pi r one, l is equal to pi
this is the way conversion is done
so these are to reference of the b class type which has alias to a b object and there is also a reference to a b class type, but it has a alias to a d object through upcast
so, learning of one task there is not affect the performance on the other task
so you divide current i0 as i0 dash and i0 double dash, i0 dash is contribution due to 4 ampere current source and i0 double dash is the contribution due to 20 volt voltage source
this single feature actually makes it a category that is far superior to moment resisting frames
it is not a much of a fall but slight fall in the return on total assets
we first look in the table and say is there an entry for k equal to 1, yes there is and so we pick it up
so n is nothing but number of turns, a is the cross sectional area, l is the length of the inductor, and meu, what is meu
ok, it refers to a technique where the faults detected by test vector are removed prior to the fault simulation with any subsequent vector
from the gate of m0 to m1 we have rg
so the goal of the this case studies that i am going to explain is to look at the impacts that we emphasized in the previous lecture, energy demand and the co2 emissions during the cement production
so, i hope this course helped you to understand human psychology little better
sometimes there can be one more winding in the transformer which is no one asked tertiary, tertiary winding is the third winding sometimes you may have in a transformer in especially power station transformers
so basically strand is made of 7wires, 6 outer helical wires and 1 centre king wire
omega is going to be large
so, this is the input and this is the output
so if you take the sum total you will get the average power consumption over both the cycles, charging and discharging
i told you which one chrome; thin layer of chrome over with gold sio2
suppose, suppose you have a generator suppose you have a generator generator is suppose giving power say p g 1 and this is your load say it is we are writing your delta p l 1 and generation power also change say delta p g 1 and this is the tie line connected that
this is a new quantity that we are introducing
the domestic kitchen in various cultures can be taken as an example which can be governed only by women and men would not prefer to enter this space
one was the surf which was for the premium segment of the people and the second was the sunlight powder which was for the low segment of the people
so, there are in various cases where universities have fought with companies, universities have fought with other universities
so, similarly you should go for an equal amount on the other side of your t naught right
and this is great
now the diode is a combination of these two
r because within cir you already have said include rectifier
so, this we have to keep in mind that there should be at least one independent source which helps you to determine the value of thevenin and norton's equivalent
so we can have a scenario like where this small process are the points where i need to distribute this signal and may be the clock is generated somewhere centrally
we now have our amplifier complete with biasing arrangements that is arrangements to set the operating point correctly and so on and the circuit is what you see over here
now gamma l we know is equal to z l minus z 0 upon z l plus z 0, so then this should also be equal to 0, and this being 0 implies zl should be equal to zs
it is galerkin’s method so, shape functions and testing functions are the same
so right, shift and zero comes in, so it will remain, or zero
so, today we are going to start a new chapter 3 which is on a measurement of resistances ok
let's take m in the z direction with magnitude m
now a simple latch that uses gates is shown here
keep in mind that the whole exercise of financial accounting is mainly for preparation of financial statements which are intended for external users
let me explain it once again separately drawing a diagram,ok, somewhat like this, i am going to have actually the magnetic field direction like this this is the magnetic field direction,right
right so, due to causality this will becomes 0 due to causality and for the same reason we are going to limit our upper limit to t right otherwise this will like e at future time instance will also come over here right
but one thing which i personally have felt is that somewhere these books are more or less like a protocol book, but cell culture has such as not just a mere protocol is definitely, there is a significant part of it which is protocol driven just like an molecular biology in a manual, even you can go through it, but a still molecular biology has a subject has tremendous amount of chemical logics and unless you understand that you will be working like a blind person; that is precisely what happens in cell culture that my young student or young enthusiast take under graduate or a post graduate; just embraces that this is technically just let follow it
right now my hands are not touching mouse, but i have already clicked that circle icon, so still it is maintaining on that monitor
but then you have to do it by yourself
so, what is that e beam evaporators cannot be used in mosfet because x rays will damage the substrates and dielectric
therefore, a stereotyping is a habit should always be avoided in the context of interpreting the body language of other interactants
however, as we have seen there are many cases or many circuits where making such designs is incredibly difficult to do
so, this is the one important point which has to be born in mine that cash is the earlier profit where is the profit is if it is only profit then it is a nominal profit
so, we use that as the basis of the shear strength but then enhance this because you have sigma not here and this sigma not can now be replaced with not only that coming from compressive stress due to the vertical load but also due to the interaction force
so, hypothesis that you initially made once you realize that repeatedly the hypothesis gets proven this hypothesis gets converted into theories
so let me try to draw the winding diagram also towards the end
so, now this capacitor actually initially assumed, it was charged say some volt[age] say some voltage say v 0 not necessarily that it will be charged all the time v 0 can be 0 also
so, it is 1 by 3 divided by 4 by 3 right
and i am applying a voltage of v1 here, i am expecting that a voltage of v2 i should get here
edison from the general electric actually gave it a shot
so, if i am measuring from vertical plane this will be 30, if we are measuring from horizontal plane that will be 20
the patentability report will have a brief description on novelty inventor step and industrial application
so, we will see all this in this lecture
so, little bit you should be careful right, so with your what you call
so, you have reactive i mean the resistance part is about you know as i mentioned 80 ohms 75 80 ohms, and the input the reactance part is almost exactly 0 and both methods are giving the same answers
64 plus j 7
so this is i will call description of a wave propagating with speed v along the positive x axis
people when they are being emotional upset the feeling channel is down here and to the right whereas, we quite often see people when they are talking to themselves, they will look down and to the left as they formulate an answer to something
if just at the operating point of the circuit you can ensure that the circuit is stable then that is enough and in fact in the next module we shall be discussing how potentially unstable circuit can be made stable
we have learnt that energy density in a magnetic field b is given as one over two, mu zero, b square
ok, so there can be an x or gate here, so one input will come from here, one input from here, like this
so, if you look at this entire process, if you backtrack now what we have, means where we started from while preparing this budget and where we have ended up is we have ended up with the two statements
so, i have to put in minus sign out of here which i can equally well write as 1 over 4 pi epsilon 0, q 1 q 2 over r 1 2 square r 2 1, where r 2 1 is a unit vector form 2 to 1, r 2 1 should be unit vector
so you must have seen a person kind of standing here and and this moves like back and forth, like this, and then this person jumps into the water
yeah, that is true, that is true
the original unix developers wanted an efficient operating system and they did not visualize the use of unix in real time and multiprocessor applications
the 50th division is the addiction psychology division which basically looks at addictive behavior including problematic use of alcohol nicotine and other drugs disorders which involves gambling eating sexual behavior or spending is also taken care by psychologists, who work in this very area the 51st division is of psychological study of men and masculinity
5 ampere current source
so, if we are taking a circle, for example, let us pick a circle, locate the first point something like p which is going to touch the bottom
so, domain is the union of both total domain
those encoded and rehearsed further move to the long term memory system
so, they called up a lady in her 60’s, mid 60’s maybe and they said, ‘ma’am, can we do something to help you
here is the code, it is very straight forward we want to find value of v remember, this is this python syntax
variables will be same in
the advantage of these codes is that regardless of in what language the patent is written
so, i know for sure that probably this side is grounded, it doesn’t matter
so, let us say that this is my computational domain over here and this wave is coming over here may be it's coming at this angle whatever variety of different angels and i am talking about let us say this boundary
so, this is going to be again if i say b square by 2 mue naught multiplied by ag multiplied by lg, lg will just be eliminating when it differentiated that is all
who holds the topic
so, in that case yourand maximum and the and in that case has a maximum response to a fixed magnitude of driving force
there will be my values and there will be other values
so look at this stuck open fault model first here, as i said, a transistor becomes permanently non conducting because of some fault
75, this is 3
so, while we go for single phase as well as three phase ac circuits, at that time this you know this theorem all will remain same, but as ac a ac circuits complex number will be involved
so, i will ask again sitaram to come here and connect it
due to which for a given voltage and for a given power il will be minimum when cos phi is unity, right
what you are thinking of is gauss quadrature which is the integral of a function over the given interval, here we are not considering a integration; we just talking about given these 2 nodes how many degrees of freedom are there
one term that is frequently associated with couplers is what is known as a hybrid coupler
so, alternatively there is a connection given to this breadboard
so, you can see that the trapezoidal rule is already over estimating the exact answer and not by some small amount 5 when the actual answer should be 4; so, that is the big change
in c, we use the mechanism to get a value back from a function; is called return by value mechanism
the similar observations will happen if you want to return a value, return something from a function by value because we will again need copy constructor to copy the value
but the main thing is that u is not known, we have not yet come to that problem; so, let us see what happens here
diodes and transistors, if required can be externally connected on to its corresponding pins finally; but resistors and capacitors can be integrated
so to bring it to the actual details, suppose i have a base class b, so i have for this base class i have two functions; one is function f and this function g
in our young days adulthood usually we do not have this type of problem, unless we are too busy and we are into multitasking then it might happen, because of competition between two thoughts which are going parallel
so, this is used many times
so, a few very general points first
the magnetic fields of line lines of force have been cut, captured by this coil, and essentially a small voltage is developed here which can be used, after suitable power conditioning, to actually power this board ah, um and all the energy is actually stored on this capacitor
but, the computation necessarily does not start with main
mobile switching center, a gateway msc that is gateway mobile switching center, home location register, and visitor location register, which i have already discussed
so, note that this format is very similar to the linker view, except that there are few changes
so this is one method where you have an input matching network and then three individual transistors each of which produce their amplification and then finally at the output of the transistors, the powers are combined through an output matching network
like cadians, we looked at some design flow in specific emphasis on physical design process, the backend design and also special emphasis on static timing analysis and related issues
this is the velocity of the water vapor that we can pass through the silicon wafers loaded inside the horizontal tube furnace
this is your actually 2 points say will come to that other thing, this is the 2 point this is 1 and 2 and this is the voltage say v 12 and this is the lamp right
now, if my machine is rotating in this direction let us say it is rotating in this direction in omega r
let us just see how this works through some examples right
it does so we add to the list of common factors
you just have to then go ahead and provide minimum steel that is required as per the code, but there is no design steel required for that particular condition
so, in this case and if you compare if you compare the they result for your p method 1 and method 2, that just what difference we can observe after your what you call after second iteration, right
so, we actually saw this and we did the gcd, we talked about the last element of the list say the list of common characters, and we said the minus 1th element n the list is the last element
whether it was having a static trend or it was having a rising trend or it had a zigzag trend, maybe some time some quarter sales went up and then went down
125 square root of fm
so, we find it even for a small increase in the value of n i
we will first try to find out the total impedance of this particular block
this is a sub function where, where the other variables remain same, only x
so this is the so called low power flip flop, which you can use in a design to reduce the signal activity inside the flip flops
it is i c; this angle is 90 degree and because of that right suppose this angle is delta dash because as you have ah your what you call from this diagram you can make out the current here i dash is equal to i c plus the i; current which is going to the load it is at the receiving end side right
so, the z0 is or the characteristic impedance for the e even mode is simply c11
of course this test generated and response evaluated must be there inside the chip and the additional control circuit, so this will also incurred some area overheads
so, there is continuity and there is an equal gap between the lines there you know
now, what we do, we first connect it to say this switch this integrator, we connect it here to the unknown
so, then the rms value of that voltage will be by root 2
so if you consider a state of pure shear stress, then your principal stresses can be considered on a 45 degree rotated plane, but depending on the magnitude of the normal stresses, you know that the principal stress direction would change
for example, like a center line instead of a continuous line we would like to draw a centerline
so what we see is this, we see that in the top case everything is fine but in the bottom case all of a sudden this huge volume here gets intruded when we force the mercury through this very small pore size here
but how do i bring in the discrete world
now, what are the types and what are the examples of those liabilities
omega two has a higher weight, ok, so if the slack value is negative you give those nets the higher priority
and this is what are outline would be the blue part is what we will do first which will significantly covered the function template
so, this circuit has a problem
university studies by paul ekman and his team and also by crroll izard have demonstrated high cross cultural agreement in judgments of emotions in faces by people in both literate and preliterate cultures
so, in that means, in this case it will be your 6 i 1 this 6 i 1 say you write like this 6 i 1 plus 12 into i 1 minus i 2 this one, because we are moving this you are going to this right minus 12 is equal to 0 right
in the first experiment, we interface the motor using the circuit that you have just now seen; in addition, we are also interfacing a push button switch like this
so, it is also done that way
so, this shortcut is based on the assumption that virtual sorting is true, is happening; the two input terminals are virtually sorted it is based on that assumption ok
each year the depreciation is 10,000, first year 10,000, second year 10,000
coming back to the basis of genetic inheritance, we all know that human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes and of this 23, 22 are autosomes
labor efficiency has to be equal to lev has to be equal to labor mixed variance plus labor yield variance
but remember that total charge will be either, if the bottom plate, this will be plus q or here it will be minus q, but total will be 0
let's say you have a combination of p and m which keeps the wall in region one
so, plastic component is the or the glass plastic component that is the important component here
so, will take the example of silver and you will calculate the density of the states and also some values of the fermi function
when a person looks at a product and sees that apple has created or designed that product then, the buyer would attribute so many things because, it has come from that entity
so finally, it is coming to i dash right
so, your v 2 will be 6 i 2 here here it is v 2 is equal to 6 i 2
now if we are looking at that this is the perpendicular line
5 dimension from here to here as a point then, i go ahead using my protractor with 45 degrees line and stop it when it is these vertical line going to intersect
i think this is from tata macgraw hills, it used to be from tata macgraw hills so this is now macgraw hill india
i think they are common for any company, rent, taxes, salaries, travelling expenses, all of them are considered as for running of business
for example, i want to bring this one this side this side my power glass will be the current magnitude this is i 2 square is the magnitude in to r 2 to this is a power glass, right
now, what would be the amount of store
ok, now what you can do is you can use these to grow myotubes
so, there are two variation of the code that we have done
current investment coated market value
this is the way also we can rotate the object and look at the views
so, this is the desired direction of the rectifier ok
8 power factor lag with 100 percent load then i have to multiply whatever is the capacity of the transformer, that is 100 percent multiplied by 0
raw two is zero
some few of might be familiar with the famous american tv sitcom friends, which was aired between 1994 and 2004 for 10 seasons on nbc television
so, what form will what how can i simplify this a little bit more
so, thus voltage or potential difference is the energy required to move a unit charge through an element right you will just i just i say thus why underline the voltage or potential difference is the energy require to move a unit charge through an element like figure look at the figure, figure 1
we already have been given share capital which is 2 to 2 and this is a substantial amount 49,000 crores
if understanding body language helps us to understand the true intent of the other person; micro expressions and their understanding further hones these skills
now, when i was referring to direct overt attack to psychotic pattern of behavior, wherever you fall on this spectrum you would have a great appreciation for life and of course, the understanding of psychology can be complimented by your understanding of other subjects and at the same time your understanding of psychology can also compliment your understanding of related subjects
you are consuming it
so, possibly i will have a functionality like display photo as a private member function in smart phone, there could be several others as well
surveys again it has big advantage
similarly, if the blocks are sharing horizontal edge, like this and these two, there will be vertical edge which will be marked by dotted edge, something like this
these are the basic steps which are to identify a set of candidate functions; that is, you first scan all functions that are been defined
things are very simple
you can go and read about the details of that, but we are going to be focusing on this t 2 now the equipment you need for this proton nmr these very big magnet you may have seen all these shiny, steel huge magnets for solid state nmr like silicon nmr, aluminum nmr
so, the elements it can be like this triangle that is what you saw in the very beginning the aircraft whichever was broken, but these are the only choice
now how what is the window dressing, how the firms do the window dressing that all i will discuss with you in the next class, thank you very much
so your input the r l of the resonator should be such that it satisfies the condition
open circuit test i think i have already told i do not need to specify it once again
so, to take gradient is very simple that is what i mean by assuming u constant
now, look at the right column, where we are trying to use the static data member
in the similar manner you can calculate torque on the inner shell and it will be lambda mu zero, k dot over two a square with the minus sign, and therefore the net torque on the system is going to be lambda mu zero over two k dot b square minus a square
so, you can also see that when we are changing frequency, you will also be able to see the change in time
so, electron generates from here will band and it will in we get incident on the crucible you see there is a crucible here and within the crucible
i have given here
first we will prepare the sales budget and then the sales collection budget, so the total collections will be known to us
w and the distance from the centroid of the tension reinforcement to the edge compression fiber
so, the resultant condition is known as overcompensation right
and again, this is technology dependent, but for the most frequently used flavor of the transistor, the threshold voltage is also greater than 0
then this wave is stabilized and inverted by the amplifier
the net amount is considered as cash generated from operations before taxes minus income tax paid you will get the net cash from operating activities
this is called a ramp type voltmeter, linear ramp type voltmeter, linear ramp type voltmeter; this is the name we can give to this digital voltmeter ok
so i can write a times db, so i am essentially going to replace this by h times la multiplied by db which means i can integrate it from minus b max to plus b max, right
so, there are formulations, there are specific details of these formulations
why we need to understand input offset voltage drip
and for speaker we have set a period of 3 milliseconds that means 333 hertz of frequency will be played on the speaker
now, next is r o p a return on total assets or return on assets as it has been called here
so, basically we started our discussion from week 1 where we discussed about the basic circuit elements and waveforms
so this is a single phase transformer, then if i am connecting all these three in three phase configuration
finally, i have given some i say set of other examples here, showing you that if you have a constant member function then you can still make changes within that constant member function by changing the const ness of this pointer within that member function
022 ohm inverse and centimeter inverse
whereas now if i am looking at only this the portion above this curve wf and below that is wf dash
there is also the chromatic version of a standard progressive matrices where you have this patterns made in colors
8 kilo newton and that is greater than the maximum shear which was coming to 202
so, in the last class i discussed some of these problems and we calculated first variance that was the material cost variance and we found that material cost variance is the 286
you can pause the video for the time being so that you can complete and verify the solution
again, we are examining compression and in a way it's not very different from concrete in its behavior in compression and studies were carried out a few decades ago and they still valid because they do a rather good job in capturing the stress strain behavior of masonry in compression
so, m 21 mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1 this is the meaning of the suffix right
welcome to week 4 of the course
what should be the sag and tension
so, how to because basically you have to either star to delta and delta to star conversion; so, how we do this
so lets us understand the superposition and the source transformation theorem with respect to ac circuit analysis
there are meaningful visuals in the video, there is a dialogue between two children
so, virtual inheritance basically eliminates that problem, but with one small restriction that for doing this since we have done this automatically we could use only the default constructor the person class
we can build and study its electrical analogous which is much easier to deal with experimentally
so, next step would be we after developing, next step would be we will do hard bake
now, let us talk about forward path gain
therefore, this line will remain same, now if v o increase a bit v p will also increase a bit
now, now i said that i will have a source of signal and another additional source of power
but again, most of the algorithms they do some kind of a systematic transformation of the problem to a, some kind of a layout that uses some kind of a reserved layer model
the first point what we have to remember is, from slant if we are going in a parallel direction, make a cut section, remove; the top portion the leftover portion on coordinate axis of x and y we see it as parabola
so, in this experiment what we have seen is that we can have multiple devices interfaced
so, now you have the initial value of i and initial value of di by dt in your hand which you can utilize to solve the equation
so, this way you can calculate the value of i1 and i2
so in this lecture what we have seen is that we can start with a very naive idea which more or less implements the function as it is defined and work our ways to dramatically simplify the algorithm
the punctuality which is practiced over there and the precision which is preferred in these cultures is reflected in various routines also
now a days, as i mentioned earlier, also, reduction of power has become of paramount importance
you will use kirchhoff's voltage law in each mesh and then you will try to find out what would be the equations for those mesh currents
similarly, for parallel equivalent i by v is equal to i p because, it is admittance that is why i by v and is equal to 1 upon r p minus j 1 upon x p is equal to g minus jb right
you can read the value of the analog voltage through built in a/d converter, you can read the data and you can make a calculation what is the actual temperature outside
most of the top rated companies have a high level of reserves
so, here the call landed at a wrong place
then we have base station controller or bsc
so, you have tried to cover the whole course in 20 hours to discuss important part of accounting
all types of verbal messages as well as nonverbal messages have their own temporalities
so, these are the properties of weak pufs, 1st of all it has been noticed that weak pufs have very good inter and intra differences
the problem comes in now when i am explicitly in time domain i have to worry about what is the relation of d and e in time because our maxwell’s equations the way in the differential form they need time yeah
it is dimensionless like any other mathematical function such as sine and cosine
so, it means this cost is equal to this cost and this cost is equal to this cost we have seen in the previous structure also that where both the cost are equal, they are intersecting with each other
what is the comparator we have studied this
look at the cursor, 1 into 2 volt right so; that means, 230 minus 40 into 0
05 ohm and here in this case everything is given that here no question of iteration or anything because data results are given
then we have the usage the structure is used from many many years normally and if not for more than 100 years so the structure is going on being used with sometimes some maintenance some repair, finally it is demolished
and let me talk about another lambda value which is actually somewhere here which is actually lambda 1
so, we can substitute in the values and evaluate this expression
it reaches a maximum if you take a rectangular cross section in a beam that is subjected to vertical shear itself you get a parabolic distribution with the peak shear stress being at the neutral axis
now, in case of zig zag bolting, if position will be in a zig zag way, so we have bolting here, then we have bolting here may be again here here
so it will be 4 t u t minus your 4 t u t minus 3
if i apply all this then first of all because i have only two digits after decimal point this 3 gets knocked off, and then because it’s set to use 6 character, now if i count from the right, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 characters but it’s set to use 6 characters, that is why there is an extra blank here
dyslexia which we will talk about in the next session, maybe autism which i will just try to briefly tell what autism is
so, rms value is equal to point this rms value is equal to 0
similarly, through a also we should draw
so, i will write this as mu l to denote that it is due to lattice scattering
and once you have done this, you can fix the thickness of this lines
20 seconds starts now let us see whether you can understand or not
so, wherever there is a square grid i assume the epsilon is constant over there
we again give a delay of 100 millisecond and send the sms
now, if you generalize this particular equation, you can extend it for multiple resistors
so if it is generator we are not talking about electrical output and if we are talking about motor we are talking about mechanical output, clearly
so, we now have an electric field and the contact potential between the metal and the semiconductor, just like we had in the case of 2 metals this contact potential depends upon the difference between the work functions
and even thereafter although we have a memory of it, we have the recollection of only significant events not everything
this is the area of the coil right
so how do we implement such a controller and generally that will lead to a improved control action and i will just in a short while redraw this and show you how to implement that
6 square 2
before that, from the time e2 happens and to the time e4 happens, that is, during e3 the object has what is known as an inconsistent state
so i am showing this as m, this as l and this is a common point
this is printing some value from ldr; it is getting some value from the analog pin, and after analog to digital conversion it is showing the digital value
sometimes book may not be given ah, but sometimes some time re such researching via found that this loss was actually this loss actually can be made it i id square plus r i q square
whereas the public part of a class attributes and methods both constitutes in interface which others can see others can access is available to anyone, who may want to use any instance of this class
finite element; so this is finite element ok
actually, task scheduling algorithms were the focus of the research in the 1970s and 80s
nnow how we are getting it right
so, there being of reluctance you are comparable to that of the gap right
ok, and some works have been done where steiner tree with arbitrary orientation, particularly diagonal connections, forty five degree angle connections are also allowed
and these blocks boxes whatever the first quadrant, second quadrant these are imaginary kind of boxes
sometimes, we need to sort values based on different criteria
now jala ram starts a store on 1st january 2012 with investment of 2 lakhs from his personal savings
maybe, like i have a certain number of pins where i have to send the clock signal
sir could
the amount to be collected is you can call it as the 100% of 90% of this amount, 4 lakhs
now what it means is if the op amp is arranged to be in negative feedback, what does that mean
it is a pleasure to be here as always and hopefully they will get something from these lectures
they will remain faithfully as part of your input
now, for every entity to calculate the profit you will need to know the incomes and expenses
suppose i choose a certain value gamma n and this is the value as say that any time my value of the magnitude of gamma in is below this gamma m, then that frequency range over which magnitude gamma that is for f such that magnitude of gamma in is lesser than gamma n
vg is the gate drive that you are giving to the vjt or any power semiconductor switch
so, you have to think about what are my fixed expenses, you have no control upon them
so this will take some time
so what is the transfer function between vc and e
so, an unmarked neighbor is 1 2
so, the overall energy of helium 2 is higher than just 2 helium atoms
so with this we close todays session
now we see that this is the wave shape of the voltage with a ripple and this is the current that is flowing output of the rectifier just before the filter
so, the first thing is they are enforceable, the second trait is that they are different from normal property we can use the word intangible these rights are intangible
so, if you do not know chi you also do not know e at that point
now let us see let us come back to our definition come back to our transmission lines where we had found out the solution for vx or z
now the profit planning, you see that you have different products you are manufacturing in any firm, a, b, c, d, four products, for example, we are manufacturing
you have to first find the expression for voltage
4 electron volts below the conduction band
therefore now we have looked at three different ranges
suppose it is not there, if it is not there then this is i i 1 only, this is x m and rest remains same right
now one thing: you see that here i have shown the connections by different colors
so, basically what is the current and voltage at the input terminals that is the impedance right
so, you learn one technique and you have not studied other techniques, so, you applied everywhere we do not want to do that
and similarly, p l 4 is equal to 600 kilowatt is equal to 0
if you do as closed standard ah, you are bound to that vendor right for any further improvements or anything
substitute in v 1 is equal to 16 i 1, and v 2 is equal to 6 i 2 into equation 2 we will get the substitute
these cells have lot of you know membrane proteins which are setting there, now if these cells have to adhere to a substrate or adhere to each other they secrete specific cementing materials and by virtue of which these blue arrows coming out are telling or telling about the cementing materials
for example, let us look at any machine gear or mechanical gears; in automobiles, perhaps for cycle, motor vehicles, even pulley shaft kind of things, the circles are quite common features
so there is a generic equation where this is the best available content
so, ; that means, this is your your what you call i 1 infinity is equal to this one
since we have done that we have moved the data member here
98 from which we will get w i is equal to 153 watt
there is nothing common
so, tau due to the scattering of the lattice, i am just going to denoted as tau l is proportional to t to the minus 3 over 2, may call this
can you think of a relation or a condition where you will get the ratio that like we got in this case, we got the ratio that omega by k is equal to c over here when i took delta x delta t tending to 0
next what we have to do is open g s shem, geds g eds g g s, put the circuit in it and then use ng spice to simulate and see the various waveforms and that's what we will do
we are borrowing this month so we have nothing to pay
in other words, odd numbers that are not prime, in this particular collection 1 and 9 are examples of odd numbers that are not prime
now, we have to prove that if you exchange value of, sorry, the location of i and e the values of current i is not going to change
so, again we can substitute you get f of e is 0
and therefore, the compiler cannot resolve
so, these resistances they do not come into picture at all
so, you can open three single quotes, and then you can write whatever you want with multiple double quotes and single quotes
so, this is v should be is equal to m into t right and your m is equal to nothing but this is your slope v is equal to v m upon t by 4; that means, somewhere i am writing ah
ah if you do not remember do not worry that is why i am kind of repeating the things that you have already been studying in the theory class
and this other input of the op amp i call it vd 0
but, in swap we need the changes in the formal parameter to come back to the actual parameter
so, i have given the name of that as my n s
because anything that v t is given and find the current your 5 milli ampere if the voltage across because, v t is 0 for t less than 0 right, so your in this case your i t 0 is equal to 0
between the shareholders also, there are many groups
so i would definitely have only e1 available across the primary winding which will be instrumental in inducing a secondary emf of e2
so, we know that ammeters are connected in series
it is the long term borrowings divided by the shareholders fund, debt was 0
now, in case of time shift, if the function is like f t minus a and multiplied by unit function, unit is step function, that is time shifted by a, then your laplace transform would be e to the power minus a s into f s that is the laplace transform of function f t
for short circuit characteristic i have to see where may be ia rated is been reached at what if
we may have to provide certain additional features for that, ok
if it is angular information we usually represent it in terms of angles
how do i compute without solving the system of equations first and once i solve it with a inexact boundary i do not know i mean what i have got is everything put together reflections everything put together
outward surface
and in this case what will happen
because, like the static data member is static member function is also not associated with any object, it is just associated with the class since it is not associated with an object, it does not have the objects address of the this pointer
so c internal will also go through charging, discharging
but in the conditional variety, the second compare instruction also you can make conditional
now we saw that when we have multi section transformers, both for the binomial or the chebyshev polynomials that we have considered the bandwidth increases when we increased the section that is the general trend that we saw
if you are talking about of hundreds of kilo watt, we may call that as high capacity right we are not talking about fractional kilo watt at all hardly ever 3 phase machines are used for fractional kilo watts
and then because of the virtual ground concept we have difference voltage zero
when an object has pointers that is referring to other objects that are dynamically created, then while copying it, if we just copy the pointer, but do not copy the object, then we say that we are doing a shallow copy, but in contrast while copying the object, if we do not copy the pointer, but you copy the pointed object, then will say that we have done a deep copy
for first quadrant system the bottom plane always be opaque plane similarly, the back side is also opaque
0125 tpkg so this is 1 minus 0
now this vx could be negative but it cannot be more negative than one threshold voltage
for simplicity let us just call these a, b and c
so, semicircle is constructed
i think i have already motivated you like why do we need object tracking, but let me give you some more examples, where you will see that just tracking the object may not make sense
we are saying ok that is some electrical energy input
so, if you notice our equation over here
as you start filling the flat jack, the flat jack starts exerting pressure against the masonry and as this pressure increases you decide at what resolution you are going to start taking measurements
let me write here this is r2 dash by 2 s, this is x2 dash by 2 which means this voltage is going to be corresponding to ef or forward revolving magnetic field dependent induced emf
so, this you have got, now you can put the value of v 1 in the above equation so you can also get the i 1 in terms of v naught so that is minus 0
so, this is your what you call minus 2 ampere
119,200 is the cost of the raw material consumed because we had the total cost of purchase and opening stock, 1,141,440
in a certain oscillator circuit, the gain is given and the feedback is given, verify barkhausen criterion for sustained oscillation
now if you are taking convolution of f with unit step the output would be minus infinity to t , f lambda t lambda because for lambda greater than t the unit step would be zero so that is why the value of lambda up to t is the upper integral component for the convolution of f with unit step function
so exactly at the point where the edge occurs, whatever is the input value, that will be taken and the corresponding value will get stored
in isometric projections first of all we have to construct this isometric axis where lengths can be measured on true scale basis
so, i have to compensate for this segments among because the integral is from minus a to b
so, in general, in general this is the circuit here in general
you have to put and you have to solve for m and c no need
so, as a result of this re computation of the same value again and again, though we in principle only need n minus 1 sub problems
so, this is at some angle theta and this is your center, this is the center right and it is revolving
because the graph what we are creating is describing the topological properties of the network
but in this problem what we have is; we have this line, we have this line if i am keeping this one q, point p and t we know
15 and 53
so, this kind of you know pitfalls make macros quite unusable and we lead to what is known as templates
we see another multimeter, again in multimeter there are probes these are called probes right
head nod suggest a particular sense of likability or its absence
you observe this electric field because the bulb lights up
it is not that for this particular simple circuit this happened to be the case
so, figure 28 a shows a voltage source v 0 u t and it is equivalent circuit is shown
if we draw perpendicular v b is equal to v f
so, now let us come to the different so called regimes
we could get 15 semi skilled less workers and to compensate for that we have to increase the number of the unskilled from the 60 to 80
so, we go ahead mark these end points this supposed to be 200 mm, then vertically we have to go by 50 mm
and we are assuming that the currents are perfectly sinusoidal
now, you could also say products, you could say a merchandise, but largely this comprises and that is the reason we have the gst tax; that is goods and services tax because, the goods and services is understood to encompass everything, that can be a part of trade
so, this does not work, right
you will write sine a cos b plus cos b, right
similarly, similarly you add equation your add equation 3 equation 3 and equation 4 already equation 3 equation 4 we have got it
in other words, we can say that discount rate is defined as the annual rate by which the discount by which we discount the future earnings mathematically
i gave you the example of a, b, c, c, d, e, you are manufacturing five products or you can manufacture five products
and you solve equations 1 and 2 you solve because only 2 are known v 1 and v 2 if you solve you will get v 1 us equal to your what you call this 50 volt right v 2 is equal to 30 volt and i 1 is v 1 by 5
so, for a normal comparator ok
because they have developed a particular association unconsciously
so, no current is here also here also it is going 0 current because i s c here it is 0 it is dependent source here it is 0
and n is how many slots are allocated per pole per phase
so, anyway, that is why that is why ah, that is why 1 dash line is shown here right and another thing is that ah for this one
here the capital does not refer only to equity but the total capital employed
the type of analysis which we are doing in portfolio management parlance, this is known as fundamental analysis
we'll see those things in a few minutes
when the malloc from this thread gets invoked for the 1st time what would happen is that the ptmalloc code would determining that this is a new thread and is the 1st invocation to malloc from that thread and therefore it will request the operating system to issue another 132 kilobytes of memory
so, call this one c then from c, d goes parallel to our a b line, transfer c to d length, which is 50 units here
so, if generally any source any current flow through the short circuit, it will not go to any your what you call any other electrical element
another thing, another important feature that we generally use this coincidental mate is to fix the origins
okay, so this is the average compression in the masonry that we can define
so, this is out of paper
so you choose r1 and r2 such that r1 parallel r2 is much more than rs
because, the flux gets minimized tremendously under short circuit condition, essentially even the voltage generated somewhat is compromised, the voltage generated also becomes compromised
i will redraw the circuit here
so, we had come up to this net working capital to sales ratio and we had seen that the movement is really very interesting from plus 8% to minus 32%
you can write zth is nothing but that is rth plus j xth
so, such a situation actually exists, for example, if 2 networks are connected in series or in shunt, then actually, we just discussed it that z and y parameters might actually be more convenient than s parameters
so, difference is in the 1 case we are receiving the material, in the other case we are sending the material
so, these are some of the 2 port devices that are commonly used, of course as i said, filters are also examples of 2 port devices but we shall cover them in a separate module
so these blind men, this is from an old indian folklore so to speak, 5 men blind men were moved on to an elephant
another exercise which i have included is this
then note taking application
this you should remember; that means, the response time is not of the order of microseconds or very lower milliseconds
the point is once i finish the whole series, i hope that you would be able to understand how we can fabricate that single mosfet right
time is 5
so, which are the assets which are subject to exhaustion
in part c, we want to calculate the depletion width on the p and the n side
so you can do some documentation with that
now, this is a very simple, because p x means there is a surface charge, there is no bulk charged, but the surface charge sigma is p dot s, because s n, which is p cosine of phi
so, then what would happen is that you would simply have this equation would become epsilon e dot is equal to curl of h correct and that is how we deal with in any yee cell i assign the permittivity to be epsilon 1, epsilon 2 whatever right
so if you see if gamma l is equal to 0 then gamma in reduces to s 1 1
the mov instruction moves the contents of edx register plus 64 bytes into the eax register
on which we start saying the threads
and this chapter is going to be on ammeters, voltmeters and oeters
one of the most popular buck boost derived converter is the flyback converter which is very very popular and you will see it in most of the commercial power supplies
it will simply not take will not be able take cognizance of the extended part of b, but it will get valid a object which is the base part of the b object and will just give you that object
as you keep on etching out the surface, the resultant stuff will be like this: you will have an array of [mit/micro], micro cantilever which will be etched out from the surface, of course with a certain amount of depth profile which will be how there
now #a, if i want to write
so, how will the display
that means this side that means, this side voltage transformation it will be k into v 2 because it is ideal transfer this trans ratio is n 1 this is n 2 e 1 upon e 2 is equal to n 1 upon n 2 that is your e 1 upon e 2 is equal to your n 1 upon n 2, right
so, it means in this case these three components one is the material then is the labor and then we have the direct expenses, these are the direct cost components
so, the local edge number is t is 1 in green right
similarly say if i want to implement an open termination, an open termination or simply an open
therefore, we would corresponding to the fast bin of 16 bytes we would have the chunk x that gets allocated
so this has to get connected to ground for signals
it may also result from the acute awareness of ones social position where you want to look down upon somebody and therefore, you do not want to shake hands with the other person
now you can easily compare this with vm cos omega t plus 5
so, 1d medium so, very simply i will take the two maxwell’s equations take curl of the other and get a wave equation and this wave equation that i get is off this kind over here the only change that happens is that instead of k naught squared i get an epsilon r prime whatever was the relative permittivity over there comes in over here ok
so, this is figure 20 one and if you do so, if you do so, this angle is 30 degree right and your v an, your what you call v an is nothing, but your v p v bn also v p we solved that here what we call all these magnitude
it includes the operating budgets that how much production we are going to do
linear operator
so, v and v because this this is your nothing is there this is a common node
so, if you recall we will, we had this table where there are two parts to the table when you design, when you design considering the masonry to take care of the shear or you design such that the reinforcement takes care of the shear coming onto the wall
so, they have a you know the width of the waveguide radius all of these have been specified
then two loops are there, if one loop is carrying that your what you call that time varying current, and another loop that some flux will be it will links some flux to the other coil right, and they are said to be actually magnetically coupled
it means that i1r1 equal to i2r2, so from here you can find out the value of i2 that is nothing but i1r1 by r2
and the current iz is equal to the difference of 2 waves and the zo is a constant, it is a constant for a lossless line but for a lossy line, it is equal to this equation
so, what an rop attack actually does, is that it replaces this return to main and starts filling in gadgets over here
so, equation 77 actually give the step response of the r l circuit with i 0 is equal to 0
i mean the hint is that i would have drawn three boxes
and then you select nucleof401re; this is the board that we are using
so, if this is a solution, this is also a solution right
whatever is happening at alpha has more influence on this because the way the shape function corresponding to this becomes 0 by the time you come over here, similarly whatever is happening over here has no influence on this
so, the first operator is the divergence
last time also i had told but once again i am reminding here it is expected that you sit with the printout, take that particular sheet and try to solve the case along with me, then prepare the balance sheet in your own notebook and check with the balance sheet as shown in the video
so what is the maximum difference in the delays between any pair of i and j
so we could have a bjt something like this, pnp based
lets assume their all of equal size, means they take equal times
nothing goes into the op amp
in this particular video, we find that cultural variations in certain aspects of our behavior which was earlier considered to be universal are displayed in an interesting fashion
one fault will be a, stuck at one, for which the inputs will be one one and the output will also become one
he imported in millions of units from taiwan
the intersection of this vertical and two others would be at lower front corner of a block with square corners we will see
basis yeah so basis functions may be unrealistic like using a pulse basis function may be unrealistic, but using you know a triangular basis function may be better right
so, if it is minus 1 then we designate that the stack is empty
this, we will discuss in the next session where we will see what do we mean by the convolution integral and how it can help in finding out the output response of a circuit where we know the input impulse response of the network
just have a look once again
so, this is the incremental part
if we do that b will be visible it goes and from b there is a line which goes and joins the top apex that one will be this one
we had zone 2 which was corroding a lot
over emphasis, over gratification of one of these three structures is going to cause severe problem
we never bother about where the space is coming from or where it is going
what is the theorem
the next thing i like to do is, in last class we never calculated the position of the fermi energy
this is what you call, if you to take the derivative of this one that i is equal to dq by dt
that is to null my output voltage, typically if you come back on the screen what you will see, typically the value is 2 millivolts, and the maximum the value is 6 millivolts
so we cannot use a normal ferromagnetic core for these kinds of transformers which are working at kilo hertz frequency, right
in the context of the business world sometimes we find that too much of an emphasis on monochronic perspective can backfire in a multicultural setting because the idea that sometimes it may take years to develop a loyal customer base is not understood by such people
so, then v p will be equal to 10 volt, this is 5, this is 15, this will be average 10 volt
so, if you consider this part
so, this is your this is just the definition of fem take your waiting function, take your residual integrate
so, if you think about a physical phone, you have a options for doing all of these interface activities on the keyboard or the graphics display, your touch screen, the phone, but do you really see any functionality where you can set the last dial number, you do not because you are not supposed to do that
i think even when we were kids being introvert was ok
or this, so this second bit becomes zero
so, here also same thing we have to find out your v thevenin and r thevenin one dependent voltage source is there this is i x, current is here is i x this this i x is here right
the first term will be del by del there is a minus sign right
but, still your results will become unpredictable
f of z naught cancels off right and then i am left with delta z by 2 is common and its their 2 times right
and we already know n channel enhancement type structure as a p type substrate right is the substrate and then you have source, you have drain, it can be like this it can be in in a different way also the same the same thing does not matter it does not matter whether you consider this is source you consider this drain that does not matter ok
therefore, this is my z we got
so, metals are so much more conductive
so this is going to be let us say e,right
so, there is a phi 1 here and there is a phi 2 here, the 2 on the boundary are the same because continuity of tangential equations right
we cannot talk about privacy in terms of implementations or objects and so on
now if two nodes are shorted to each other, obviously they will be at the same voltage
so, this whole term is remember that we cannot actually do any analytically evaluation of this integral
it is a perforated unit and you can see that it's cored
so, from equation one you please solve this one you please solve this one for your l
i have another register, lets say ri plus one
this is not while yeah this is you can call it susceptibility yeah which is going to be also written in n is equal to 1 to n right
now, properties of the laplace transform and the laplace transform of basic common functions were discussed in the previous classes
so one of the main objectives of placement may be to reduce the overall wire length, because one intuitive argument you can give that if i minimize the overall wire length it is expected that the performance of my circuit will also improve
so, we say list1 is 1, 3, 5, 7 list2 is also 1, 3, 5, 7 and list3 is list2
so, question so, if you look at the way we derived this
is it correct
so, in terms of a circuit model, how can i think of this
nature of the output waveform parameters used a range of frequencies etcetera
we could put it at the middle of the cell, but then the problem is boundary conditions enforcing
and this type of biasing naturally is known as source feedback bias
so, i have not actually solved the problem, i have just converted it into a form that is easier to look at
we want that the total power consumed by our transistor is very less
so, i will have 8
one is borrowing's long term and one is only borrowings
so, you can have s p 3, s p 2, s p hybridizations
now these 2 are connected together you can very well see that they are connected in series,right
whenever you have available long dimensions, we show it like over that
r un primed coordinates right that is that is indicated over here
now, the smith charts are commercially available, they can be downloaded from the internet
if we say t is equal to say just the letter x, then the type of t is also a string
in fact, it can be said that a direct and positive eye contact can often make the difference between one selection or rejection
so in the next week we shall be starting our discussion on the timing analysis, the various ways you can carry out timing analysis, static timing analysis and ways in which you can annotate or modify a design so that they perform better with respect to timing
so, this is slip ring or wound rotor, whereas this is squirrel cage rotor okay
what are the other three dimensions
and that makes it sometimes inconvenient because we would prefer to have uniform aa characteristic impedance and also uniform with
so, now we have here three operational amplifiers; 1, 2, and 3 right because in our circuit also we had three op amps right
let here i am giving an example again
so, this is the top view that has to make 45 degrees inclined to the vertical plane
input was a square wave and the output was a triangular wave
but on the other side if it is greater than, i am not changing, the next bit i am changing to 1, and this process repeats
so, this is the process how we prepare the cost sheet
so, how do you again same problem i want to you know send a beam here, but not that all of those things
what's the shear force, axial force interaction for a given masonry wall for different levels of axial force acting on the wall
so ah, for n type mos transistor, for example sorry for a n type transistor if c equal to one, which means the transistor t is on, which means it conducts
it is very common in certain societies as well as in certain organizations to make the subordinates wait for the appointments so that they can internalize the significance and importance or the higher rank of their superior
let us look at that a parabola has to be constructed with a rectangle size of 140 mm by 100 mm
so, this p s array if i just use a different color, say this particular one is a function pointer, because p s array is this array
it can be symbol which denotes that everything is all right, it may also suggest that it is zero
once it is done with f 1 as centre; so, f 1 is centre the distance from a to 1, this distance let us measure it with that distance from f 1 make an arc something like that on both the sides
and just for comparison i will show the single port or a 2 terminal non linearity here, we have a single voltage and a current
so i needed another layer and i need wire connection
so, in our fdtd simulation let us for now forget pml and all that right
it just keep this in mind every python function, every python class, if you want to use a function in the object oriented style, the first argument must necessarily be self and then the real arguments
what happens is when z2 is very close to z1 then this gamma21 is small & so this expression, gamma l & gamma21 magnitude, will be even smaller because gamma l is either 1 or lesser than
it will go everywhere and why depending on the shape of the object
so, minus sign so, minus j 2 mutual your reactance is j 2 minus j 2 into i 1 plus i 2
so, we practically speaking when you think of antennas radar cross section of antennas you know the issue of charge is sitting out there is not very relevant ok
so it must have a prototype included in the scope of the class and must be prefixed with friend, we have just in the example of the display function as to how do you write the signature of that function within the class with a friend in the front to say that this particular function is a friend of this class
so this is the model of the sequential circuit that i showed just now: that you have a combinational logic where the primary inputs and primary outputs are coming and going
now, how to remember this you just remember only one circuit difference amplifier, how to remember, remember this rule nopg
does it mean that electric field is only in that wire or does it exist everywhere
there some additional noting have made here, which is a immediately not very important, but you can note that since this is a private member of the base class, private member cannot be access from outside
ist isit 90 degree
let us see one medium on one side has permittivity epsilon one
all of us have done basic electronics project in our undergrad studies, where we have done soldering
and therefore, effective displays help us to avoid friction in a particular situation and this is there significant role
so, your bonding orbital has a lower energy that is your sigma, anti bonding orbital has a higher energy that is sigma star
no input signal is needed to start the oscillation
so, these two are the terminals of the meter through which the unknown current i should entered and leave
so it does not actually start from 0 to 200 kilometre or whatever speed it is going at, at that moment but it is already at a rotating speed so the tyre ware is minimal
this virtual function will get delegated because manager classes over did in this function with the logic of how to compute manager salary and this will correctly invoke the process salary of the manager
and what are the process flow, the op amp is fabricated on tiny silicon chip, right
let us see what a 2 point gauss quadrature rule gives us
so, these defect states can essentially modify the electronic properties
it could be a flexure dominated mechanism, it could be a shear dominated mechanism
notice that a mylib int is used in exactly two locations, one is at this point over here in function setmylib int and the second one is at this location getmylib int
sub graph of a given graph is formed by removing branches from the original graph
so, for now, let us quickly recall what we have seen we have seen inverting amplifier, we have applied the input at a inverting amplifier, we measure the output from that output, v out by v in, we have measured the gain, right
large number of employees in given organization, you want to identify who are the people who should be transferred to rnd section, who are the people who are who can be sent negotiate which are the other agencies, who are the people who would be very very reluctant to these changes, who are the people who would be extremely balanced if they are given certain critical tasks; you can use big 5
private access is for the members of the class, public access is for everybody
in next classes, we will learn about more options available at solidworks
so, with that, as the reaction proceeds, you see reaction of ye'elimite, right
we can increase the band width we can increase the bandwidth
so, you see that how the different lengths of rigid offsets is then used to ensure your total frame along the height is modeled as an equivalent frame
now given that you are have, r 1 equals to 1 kilo ohm this one, right
all of those charges once they start moving they become currents and we already dealing with currents
nothing special about maxwell’s equations right
and we are trying to find out the mutual inductance m 2 1 that is that is this one m 2 1
so, fix this x1 point and rotate it so that we will be in a position to see that
so the plating rule was, or e is you plate the muscle first and wait for one to two hours and then add the motor neuron
so if you take the manhattan distance, the wire length will be simple, this, but for a general multi terminal nets, how to estimate
you will look at it that way
likewise if we define d to be an empty dictionary then we can use a function such as d dot values to get the list of values currently stored, but we cannot manipulate d as a list
how non inverting amplifier operates
where as in this particular case we have considered two magnetization characteristics
if i want to delete everything in this sketch mode what i can do is, use your left click button, hold it; hold it mean press continuously without releasing then select the object, then it select everything, then you can delete
so, may as well and put the source here and observation over here ok, it is a symmetric situation over here
so i think that should be the first step
now we are connecting this to the power supply, and we have switch on the power supply
so, we have here we have to obtain the norton equivalent circuit
so its failure may occur in this way
so, i should be able to write some of the equations electrical equations based on whatever characteristics i have drawn, i can say vt is equal to eg minus ia ra, right
so we are looking at the two endpoints and then we are trying to see how much of mechanical work has been done
what was the need for that
so, increase in the inventory will it increase the expense or reduce the expense
if the tax information is also given, then we work out the net profit before tax and after that we treat the tax, adjust the tax and we work out the final profit which is called as the net profit after tax
the other person may gets stuck as we were talking about the memory keeps haunting you and then it may lead to whatever else like it happened in mahabharat; a small land piece he would duryodhana would have given, but it did not happen
so, vgs vg minus vgs plus vds equals to vd
that quantification may be different, it may have less or more or like people who suffered in people who fought in partition in the partition of india; people killed, they got killed
so, this is a correction right
so this particular figure over here shows how the refreshing occurs, so refreshing typically occurs periodically in a dram structure, so these particular areas is where the dram is inaccessible due to the refreshing period where the capacitors are recharged, while the accessible regions in the dram is over here
47 angle 59
so, for example if we have this memory controller what we could possibly do is if your input is 5 you ex or it with a certain specific key and obtain a value of 8
so we know just e equals to q naught e to the power minus tau y r c pi a square epsilon naught
these are some of the technological literacy concepts that we need to keep in mind while designing learning activities in e learning
now, if i am having 1 inductance probably let us say l di by dt equal to vl, voltage across the inductance, lets say i am going to have i equal to some im sin omega t, right
so, once i read in these things i mean what would i read in to
now, in the book by pozart, solution for this implementation is given
that's very easy to see, because z is nothing but cosine of theta r minus sine of theta
3 meters in length and hence we expect the response, lateral load response of this wall to be basically governed by shear deformations
that means the copper losses are going to be high, which means efficiency will be low
let us just align these wheels to this rail track; i will make it mate
if the switch is not pressed, the output point will be high, if the switch is pressed it will be low; it will be connected to ground
so, this will become k1 into e to the power minus p1t and similarly, for other times also you can find out the inverse laplace transform
our question is, that instead of using the built in list for stacks, queues and heaps and other data structures can we also defined a data type in which certain operations are permitted according to the type that we start with
if on the other hand it did, what we would perhaps think is more natural and it will do i, i plus 1 up to j, if this were the case then every time when we wanted to actually range over the list positions, we would have to go from 0 to length of l minus 1
traditionally people used what is called a front loading technique
the corresponding current im is 0
4 degree volt
so designers seem to be quite a bit interested in this and we will see, of course the challenge is, we have only done this in the lab menu and to do it for concrete, we are going large, you know even though 0
33 microseconds
so, inside each node we have 2 attributes value and next as we said and remember that self is always used with every function to denote the object under consideration
so, we just add an extra clause which says paths(i, j) is 0 if there is a hole at (i,j); otherwise we use exactly the same inductive formulation and now what happens is, if i have a hole below me, if i have a hole below me, no paths can come from that direction because by definition paths(i, j) at that point is 0
we are simply removing means, removing means your short circuiting the voltage source and leaving the current source as it is
so, being a member function it has this pointer like any member function, but its name as i already mentioned is specifically the name of the class which is not so for the other member functions
so, little bit we have seen single phase transformer, then we have seen your 3 phase induction machines only in brief right
or, you can do another thing, you can read this value, store it in some online database as we have shown you earlier using the sms control
so whatever is the current drawn from the stator side only will go towards producing real power, which is in manifested in the form of torque, which is rotating the motor
but i have now the entire set of values of p critical and if i normalize p critical by p u, pu being nothing but the compressive strength of the cross section, right, the load at which compressive strength of the cross section is reached
so, if you have sinusoidal waveform, so it will complete 50 such cycles 50 such cycles in 1 second right
if you look at each loop, which is the force displacement excursion in the positive and the negative, and if you look at one excursion, the area under the curve is representing the energy dissipated in one cycle
so, i is equal to ir plus il plus ic right
we will call the second function because the first parameter matches as double
this is a sample diagram showing pic 16f877a microcontroller this is how it typically looks like
so, this how we can change the range of voltmeter and we can also make multi range volt meters
what was the two cases
maxwell’s equations will not allow a sudden flip between the field at 2 adjacent points unless there was some material or something like that
so, when we substitute this we can write this as let us look back at our original form over here
so what this question ask is: solar energy falling per unit time, per unit area for the earth at normal incidence is about thirteen, fifty watts per meter square, what is the corresponding value of the electric field for solar radiation
so in contrast, the integrated approaches that we have also considered, the third approach, they use some kind of a mathematical formulation, they formulate some constraints
and we will open that asm file that we just saved this f 1 we will click ok
so, it will become 20 angle 36
does anyone recognize what this expression on the right looks like particularly this expression
so slicing structure actually tells you how to slice a floor plan repeatedly until you get the basic blocks
from this, now this production, total production of 170,000 units is not going to market
let me show this to you through a demonstration
if you see anything can be bulb or any light or fan, you will find some specification is there and one important specification is the power right
so, you will be looking at bugs in the system, and how an attacker could utilise these bugs to create malware or create exploits that could be introduced into your system and then could run and steal data in your system
they will deflect from the baseline, they will go back to the baseline
several things; one is i do not need to take the back door
so, again we have long dash short, dash long, dash short, dashed line
this will be actually the force with lambda as a constant, lambda as a constant
masonry structures have a different lateral load resisting mechanism as we have been seeing during the course of this, during the lectures of this course
only when we look at the economic impact, the social impact and very importantly the environmental impact we can say that the technology is successful in terms of sustainability ok
sigmund feud basically talked about two important things
and then in the numerator this z cancels this z so this then becomes equal to 1 upon z, d capital z upon small z and this whole multiplied by the small z
she then provides assessment questions similar to homework based on these 5 lectures is this e learning
so, these are all 0 outside
the most central location in a group physical arrangement allows for greater participation by the members, at the same time it also provides a certain dominance to a person and it is also linked with the perception of other people that the leadership of that individual is being perceived
9,000 units
we then have the fourth role which is somewhere between 10 nanometer and 1 nanometer
the sale increases slowly over time
so, this is with r external whereas this is inherent and this is the speed and this is the torque, right
let me now go to problem 4
since the torque is maximum that is the stalling torque right
so, if you are given, determine vt, that is threshold voltage for k of some value, i d on for some value with v g s on for some value
so, let us see whether we can find some voltage at the output or not oknot
so, company has a healthy cash policy
however, there is sigma two which is q over four pi r, square over the surface, and i also know v two outside
86 and then lambda right once lambda is found we can find out the value of allowable stress fcd because corresponding to this lambda and with buckling class c for fy is equal to 250 the allowable stress is becoming 84
every time a promotion runs, he has revenue and it just dwindles out because they go back to their local mechanic
now, even a small flaw in this entire design could result in a vulnerability and it could lead to an exploit that an attacker could use to gain access into that particular system, so one quite famous flaw is the intel pentiums floating point bug
in order to have the maximum power so for maximum power dpdv should be equal to 0 so we are just differentiating this expression
so for this kind of a gate drive, when you look at the vp of the pole voltage, the bjt is on v in is appearing at the pole and when the bjt is off diode is conducting minus v0 is appearing at the pole so let us draw the waveform for that and the position it here so this would be the waveform that you would expect to see at vt the pole
similarly, the life time of the electrons in the p region is only 5 nanoseconds and this difference is because of the difference in concentration of the dopants, the thermal generation life time is also given
so, you get total expense of 38 and 41 respectively
so then if we move along the surface of the along the edge of this circle which has the center at origin then we are moving along a transmission line
if we have more number of divisions, the curve will be very smooth to draw it
so, let me clear it so that that is why v c is equal to 2 volt now energy here what you call energy stored in the capacitor is wc is equal to half c v c square
once we are done these point we call a
so, when we are so, take a general example let us say that i have an antenna let us say that is your wifi antenna over here and you have some human being over here, you could even have a mobile phone in his hand his or her hand
so, the parts that are spark plugs are number 21 and 22, sleeve is number 23, the similar
okay, so we can also do it for share capital although it won't make much sense because share capital is unchanged
series field is going beyond parallel connection of the shunt and armature, right, so this is generally known as short shunt
and then, he has to connect the oscilloscope, he has to start the oscilloscope
but this is one of the rarest configurations that are used anywhere, unless i ground the neutral
so, count is equal to 5 and if this time period is tr; this is reference time period, then input time period is how much
so, observer 2 has access to this n cross e 2 and observer 1 has access to this and they say fine they compare n cross e 2 n cross e 1 what do you expect the answers to be they will agree boundary conditions, even though i have created hypothetical surface boundary conditions should still be valid
that way also we will be in a position to fully explore that view for the front
in case of natural method, what we do is we keep the object as an observer, we walk around that object, by looking at that object how it really looks like
the system of equations that fem gives will converge to the correct solution under this guarantee i mean under this requirement
so we have a link between the electrical quantity and the mechanical quantity in the form of the electromechanical energy conversion
so, let us go to top plane
so, for calculating the total cost of the product or service, what we do here we calculate the sub cost and then we sum them up so we calculate the total cost of the product
so again, just lets visit the skeletal muscle biology as a backup
so this was something about our band pass filter
because we cannot show horizontal plane in the horizontal direction of a 2d sheet we make it below that vertical plane
minus u 4 phi this remains the same t 2 a and what do i have
now, in case of x2 the b2 changes the displacement from x1 to x2
7 centimeter and ultimate strength is 32 into 10 to power 6 kg per meter square right, when erected between supports 300 meter apart, i mean 2 towers or poles they are 300 meter apart and having 12 meter difference in height that is h is equal to 12 meter this is given
so, f is virtual, which means that it will get dispatched to class c, the type of the actually pointed object
when i do the reverse think of when i do the reverse then what i am doing
for gate size v, for five capacitance, the delay was forty five prefer seconds
so, this one will be i c is equal to 6
it is classified because it will make difference in the cash flow statement
in this subject we are going to learn about how to draw lines, curves, various mechanical parts
with respect to frequency, with respect to frequency how your output resistance is going to change
for this i'll take a rectangle in the x, z plane here and traverse it counter clockwise
you will get es, oh sorry epsilon s, it is called static because of zero frequency right
and this might be a source of sadness to many
this is just one mask process
to set the ringtone which certainly will have to take the particular ringtone that i want to set and for adding new acquaintances to my address book, i need a add contact where, i need to specify the number and i need to specify the name of the person
so, any such cash or bank balances not available for business will be separately disclosed
so, now this is r2 dash, this is x2 dash and then this is what is our load, which we are calling as zl dash, right
so, if you come back to the screen, so if i have an opamp in the following configuration, in the following schematic or following circuit, then what i see is that i am applying an input to the inverting as well as non inverting amplifier correct applying an input to the inverting as well as non inverting terminal of the amplifier
immediately tells you that grad phi is zero gradient or the or the or the derivative of phi zero
i go through a paragraph and i would want to make my point of view on top of that page
so, the question what is the frequency or what is the time period ok and we should be also able to draw the waveforms at different points this voltage this output etcetera
now, what is these red circles are the these red circles are the gain circles of the locus of the gamma i for a particular value of capital gi and this blue circle is the smith chart
where is in the us and in northern europe, listeners are encouraged to look directly into the eyes of the speaker because this direct eye contact is considered to be a sign of confidence and openness
25, and r r thevenin r norton same it is v o c by [i o c/i s c] i sc; that means, v thevenin by short circuit current here also 3
so, what is this saying
then you do not train them for further skills, first get an understanding of the content itself
cylinder
left its 1 at the left node so, it is therefore, 1 yes ok
now i'm writing cost of goods sold, in the early product, i the cost of production
bbecause you have a conducting plate, you have a conducting plate when, when it is not operating, it is is like a 2 conducting plates separated by some material by some dielectric material
previously, supposing i took a wave travelling in this way right
so, what we will see, what we will see is that the output this output even it is in finite voltage gain, even it is in finite voltage gain, the output cannot exceed, output cannot exceed more than more than the supply voltage more than the supply voltage
so, when you do experiment particularly in your second or third year induction machine experiment, at that time wound rotor machine definitely we will see
i will stop here
so, what we do is total depreciable amount will divide it by the estimated total production
so, now, in path mate, the path mate ask us to for the vertex that is center of this ball and the path that it has to travel along
so, it is minus 0
so, once again its best to verify this for ourselves to convince ourselves that this description is actually accurate
so, you would not this difficultly if we are talking about reversing the current coil, but whatever you got as may be after reversing you will get a positive reading but note it down as minus so and so watt
when you will solve this problem know all this problem when you will see this, first you will draw the circuit on your notebook after that you see what is happening right
its priority value changes once it religious the resource unless it is holding other critical resources
47 ohm right
we could have that done for unreinforced masonry and extend the same thing to reinforce masonry as well
and, whatever ide you are using, you specify that these are the standards; like c 99 is a standard that you are using
they calculating; we are enforcing the boundary conditional along the centre point of the axis
if you recall quickly hartley oscillator this we have seen right, crystal oscillators we have seen, then we have seen ujt oscillators, and its characteristic curve right
so, we have v o, this is v p minus v n and the characteristic as always is like this
so this is one way of looking at the problem
maybe they have recovered some of their long term advances
one more example is gratuity
so, when we will do the laboratory experiment at that time you can see this, but i am not sure whether you will do the same experiment of first year or not right
the files, buffer, disk io and the swapper is the highest priority in the unix operating system
in b we find that it is the sole of the foot which is moved in the direction of the other person
so, here you have no more growing the cells not on a glass substrate with thin film or a thin film or a thin gel you are having the whole gel and you want to grow the cells on the gel
we were sort of grouping some of the common observations and you can be very detailed with this as you can see here
so, these left limit and right limit i am going to set to each other, so that i get a continuous function we have basic definition of continuity
now as i said mercury intrusion porosimetry has been very heavily criticized and many people say we do not use that anymore
we can actually say put a metallic plate here on this side and similarly, another plate on that side ok
so, that means the same as before the instantaneous value of the power
because it is a first year level, so little bit little bit practice is necessary right
so, to many of you it will be the first time that you are encountering this object called greens functions ok
so, the first line with this double colon says that factorial is a function and this is itõs type, it takes an integer as input and produces an integer as output
so, let us let us look at a very simple identity this first part of the left hand side ok, this is what we are going to look at the second part is easy
so, the resultant visibility of z has become the lesser of public and protector
now, how will the output change
but before that let us understand what this gradient operator means
5ampere
now this output is finally fed to the pwm which will generate the appropriate duty cycle pulse and give it to the power semiconductor switch here
so the student comprehending and coming to an understanding of what needs to be written
2 lagging, right because a no load power factor is very poor
l by two, so my delay will become approximately half right
so if i look at i versus phi or lambda versus i
it comes here, so it will be eleven minus four
but one thing is true here: here, because both the pull up and pull down networks are conducting, there will be high current that will be flowing from vdd to ground
this holds in an e learning context also
now this communication through the covert channel is essentially due to the shared cache memory that is present between the process a and process b
it is motion
suppose water refractive index is one point three, three minus one point five over one point three, three plus one point five square, which is point one seven over two point eight, three square, and you calculate this, this comes out to be one over roughly one over two seventy, so less than two percent, almost, you know less than ah point hundred over two seventy, so less than two percent of the light is reflected
four pi epsilon zero r
since shaking hands is a particular type of a touch, we may also remember the emotion which has been communicated with the help of this touch, it may communicate a certain warmth, a desire to dominate the other people, it may also convey a reluctance to talk to the other person
in case of the rotational mechanical system, we got t is equal to j d2 theta by dt2 plus b d theta by dt plus k theta
there are only two unknowns over there
gold is expensive but copper is cheaper but copper has a better, you can say one point seven, silver is comparable
now i'll make this minus sign mathematically meaningful
so, second derivative of a function is 0 i am taking the derivative with respect to which coordinates primed or unprimed
while the file is being saved, you can do anything because it's a synchronous call
then various expenses are given like purchases, wages, interest, depreciation, office expense, goodwill, tax, dividend
so, this is inverting amplifier, we will discuss this inverting amplifier in the subsequent lectures, right
suppose i have a floorplan where i have two blocks, a and b, placed side by side, separated by a vertical partitions
in any case it has to be less than this
as you know, microwave engineering is a field in electrical engineering where we deal with signals having a certain frequency range
think you are going to get into a lot of troubles
now this is where the influence or the advantage where non contact type video extensometer comes into play, since the cracks can form anywhere, you can also form in the position of an lvdt or a strain gauge
we will look at that as well, okay
that means it varies from plus z to minus z axis, and then let phi vary from zero to two pi, and that covers the entire space
that will be adjusted in a way that is current asset or current liability right it can be current asset or it can be current liability and put a bracket here and that is 1 1/turnover turnover of asset or liability sorry i would uhhh write it here as the current asset or current liability
so, approximately we are not considering the resistance of the wire it is neglected
i find it to be much more useful than just the raw textbook alone
by mistake initially written t by 2 pi
you just can't make them with only linear devices
so, each of the force act tangentially and produces you are what called turning moment equal to the force multiplied by its lever arm right
so, planning and controlling is clear to, i think why now
the two variables are; if i look at these first two equations what are the two variables in these equations
for example even in the country as a whole if you talk about in any economy when the government has to come for the annual budgets, they also directly or indirectly consult the people of the country
so, active power is nothing but vi cos phi, here voltage v is a difference phasor because it is generally 0 so we are considering it as a reference phasor and then you have to simply put the value of current, current would be what
norms which are specifically designed for specific age group specific racial group specific cultural group and likewise and then when the individual
at that time the focus was shrinkage compensation by inducing expansion in concrete
so, he given that if i look into the layout of b, this value except something like this
it is said that a train pilot can purportedly identify a plane flashes as briefly as 1/200th of a second
so, all the tools of linear algebra can be applied to these problems to solve them ok
7265 henry that is l 1 and m 2 1 is equal to your n 2 into phi 2 1 that is equal to actually phi 2, because in the other coil there is no current i 2 is equal to 0 right
so this freewheeling path is a very very crucial path this is right now a lossy freewheeling path later on i will also discuss touch upon lossless freewheeling paths for now we have to now look at the input output relationship and then the then the waveforms
for example, a simple series circuit is there where resistance r
you can read these statements
if no copy constructor is provided by the user, by the programmer, if i write a class which does not have a copy constructor, the compiler will supply a free copy constructor and the compiler provide a copy
the other ones, the deferable server priority exchange and the sporadic servers are simple improvements over the polling server
and this case we can write the condition of stability condition for unconditional stability provided the modulus of s11 or s22 is lesser than 1, is that the difference between the distance of the center from the origin and the radius of the stability circle if that is greater than 1 then the points inside the smith chart are unconditionally stable
so, it is the does not is not really as simple as i am saying, but it is almost that
so, let us pick this one, this one, all the 6 sides of hexagon
so, the estimated frequency is how much
now in the fourth problem there are this one more issue we are going to deal with which is a very quite comprehensive and interesting problem and that issue we are going to deal with here is that is the issue of adjusting the opening and closing stock
and, now the current which will flow through this meter i ok; so, this is the voltage call it v
yes some of you got it
one is a small home automation system, where we will switch on and off a light through sms control
you can immediately see this gives me the right answer for b
and also because it is dc, capacitors are open circuited and inductors are short circuited
so, there is a chemical here which is called photoresist developer
now, what remains is to calculate this integral and the integrand is a polynomial in general
however the voltage across an inductor can change abruptly, next 1 is an ideal inductor does not dissipate energy right
so, we use these words interchangeably a research if research needs to be commercialized, then the technology developed in the university has to go to the market or to the industry players
so, the approximation made is approximate your circle sorry your square by a circle of the same area
in the first session we had seen the purposes of each of these statements
so, it is minus t 0, if you take the this side negative will come, but distance is 1 minus t 0 minus your t 0 plus 1 right
now you see why this method is easier, we don't even need to write the nonlinear equations of the original circuit
so, an nth order differential equation can be decomposed into n first order differential equations
we will see how you can deposit dielectrics or semiconductors right using physical evaluation
so, what is the particulars here
so, it is approximately 6 ampere
so, i cannot simplify this, so what would do you in this case
this is, it requires a lot of gymnastics in the site but it is something that is feasible and particularly when you are working on existing buildings, seismic assessment of such buildings where you have sacrificial walls where walls are actually going to be torn down because of alterations being made or because of heavy damage a building is going to be pulled down then that presents you a wonderful opportunity to actually execute such a test because it gives very valuable in situ information of sheer strength of masonry
similarly, you want to increase that size use these two buttons together, you press them together so that it enlarges or change the size
so, now if we change theta the phase angle of e will change ok
now, if you write kvl around this particular loop where we are assuming that current i is flowing in this particular loop
so, now this is what, this is nothing but the input impedance, this is the input impedance; input voltage by input current input impedance, this is equal to 2 r 1 ok
so, for that you don't have the budgets because you have only static budget for one level
but in the laboratory right that generally we will perform that this one on lv side your what you call the supplier that youryour open circuit test, you perform on the lv side andnot on the high voltage side right
let us see a simple mosfet which is an active device and has some noise associated with it
student: then the medical therapy is all process of procedures can be protected to mutual properties
for source the circuit, we have seen that and this is actually we call forced response that is some that is the due to that external force, that is your nothing but that your voltage source, right
so, of the two terms that come on the right hand side one remains, which has a known information and the rest goes back right
so, the next instruction will be from somewhere else
similarly, you can again do a print of 20
so, we build this heap now we said that the delete max will remove the element at the top because that is the root, but it will also create a vacancy here, this is the value that will go to the top, this is the last leaf which will go the top when we fix the delete max
this is your z y is given, and v ab is also given
how about theta unit vector
so, this is the initial one, it is initialized with 4
so, this is understandable right instead of l 1 i make reactance and and this current i
silence can be understood as a vocal absence of words or any associated voice yet the way the silence represents our meanings is very subtle and yet it is resonant
so, better not a suitable for this course at least right, some just some general ideas right, but the length of a typical damper is about 60 centimeter and weighs about 5 kg or more
now, this gm is nothing but the partial derivative of id with respect to vgs
so we have a scenario like this
so, this is the current
so, l is equal to 2s, s small 2 into small s this is equation 50
so, the data sheet when we say it will show you the ib value, which is nothing, but ib1 plus ib2 by 2 right
but if i invoke the methods through functions or through reference then i may have static or dynamic binding depending on whether the member function i am invoking is a non virtual one where the static binding will happen or when the member function is a virtual one where dynamic binding will happen
so, i am going to call this phi i what should it will be a function of r or r prime
within ritual contexts, food often stands in its expressions of life, love, happiness and grief
exactly he has a right idea right
so after small delay, d is changing from one to zero
typically you are we want to know what is the overall behavior
other disbursements are now wages and salaries
and enron is a very striking case because enron was a very big donor to both the major parties in us
so, this is a very common approximation that is used and that gives you very good accuracy also
so it is better to layout the power lines on one of the top layers because they will be, they will be thicker in any case, they can carry more currents
but, i have just passed the function name directly
so, this is the way how you can understand the input bias current ok
then for every function or for group of functions, you have separate implementation files, which will include the same header
we call from previous lecture that b zero is nothing but e zero over c
and internally they are again dictionaries, so they have their own key value
but now is the time to just look back and just think about one thing is that edf and rma they are actually different types of schedulers
if we had just air in between, then it would look something like this will all epsilon 0
ok so a little bit of electrochemistry
in this case then maybe 2 times the fundamental, 3 times the fundamental, 4 times the fundamental and so on
so these are generally inherent problems that are face in such application where i am going to break the circuit and reconnect the circuit
so we can in this way we can eliminate the i1 from the equation
efot is equal to c into size to the power k where c is a constant based on the developmental mode
that we have discussed
so, as far as this eprom is concerned, it continually seize the address bus address bits a7 to a15 and a when this psen bar line is activated
if you don't have sufficient space, the arch cannot form and then you will not have load being resisted in the form of an arch or the arching action itself cannot be fully, you can't fully depend on the arching action in case geometrically you don't have the sort of a configuration
so, this again becomes true length and this angle is the true angle similarly the line c d 1' with horizontal axis whatever angle its making true angle phi we will find
this diagram shows how a parallel plate capacitor looks like
so, let me clear and go back to that equation at kcl at node b, right
so, like in this case we have two meshes we have assumed that both are in the clockwise direction with i 1 and i 2 values, so current will remains same but the link between these two meshes have been removed because it was containing the current source
now, equation 83 right, we know w is equal to f square plus w square this is we this is your w and this is your f right
this is djj minus ajj, right
for r is smaller than capital r and for r is greater than capital r
in top view we can observe this inclination angle with the vertical plane, so that a point, b point and c point we can draw it
so this is the basic idea behind writing a polish expression
similarly, transfer that length in this direction with the same 45 degrees angle
now, i am going to connect this to something called as an auto transformer, auto transformer is like an inductor, iron core inductor, nothing else, i just have a larger number of coils, okay
so, i can have one another object over here no problem, i just have to include that in the definition of epsilon ok so, this is very general
so, board of queen will tell us how many rows there are in the thing
so, the stress due to compression is actually removed from the estimate of the flexual tensile strength
how to construct such kind of spirals
this is what we have also computed
now suppose we want to add a score to this
so, again, i hope this part is very clear, otherwise, please go back and think about it
this is my ideal response, it should look like this right
and the debt equity ratio, which is perhaps the most common and extensively used debt is calculated as a percentage of equity but while calculating the ratio in the numerator we take debt plus preference share capital keep in mind actually normally shareholders equity includes preference share capital, but for the purpose of this ratio, we deduct it from the denominator and add it to the numerator because though it is a shareholder's funds, it is repayable within 5 to 10 years
the top view front view we will be new portion to draw and it is inclination angle with hp also we will be in your position to find it
on the basis of that we will prepare a cost sheet and that cost sheet will help us guide us to attain that cost which has been worked out in the cost sheet or in the statement of the cost
so, this integration goes to the first term goes to 0
so all this faults along the path will also be detected by this test vector
we saw yesterday, was 1350 centimeter square per volt per second, mu h is 450
and hopefully you will be able to recognize the structure
so, how do we go from lumped elements to microstrip or distributed elements which we have to use when we are in the microwave domain
therefore, this means that for this permutation the next permutation is this one
and the reference book for example, which is chapter 3 of this book by volakis, they do not do the shortcut they go through get a larger system of equations then do some algebra to reduce it further
now the way this tree is constructed is based on parameter epsilon, which is a positive constant which determines some kind of a tradeoff between radius and cost
this is the upper trigger point of a schmitt trigger lower triggers point of a schmitt trigger
now, let say that this observer wants to change in some wants to move in some direction and this direction could be arbitrary and i want to know how does the potential change
the 2d sketches what we have drawn the same representation you will have at computer level also because earlier days something like some 50 60 years back people communicate their skill set in terms of drawing, production drawings everything through 2d drawings, but nowadays these 3d softwares really help us to visualize the object to design it
during the interviews sometimes candidates become confused as to with home they have to maintain the eye contact
so, on the one side you will calculate the total cost from the cost sheet and then you will calculate the per unit cost also because number of units information is also given to us
so, this; that means, this example intentionally i have taken
you know that v out over v in can also be written as a v upon 1 av beta
and we don’t really know why we seem to be able to get mercury in some gel pores in white cement but not in other cement
there may be some cascaded networks also where the output of one network goes as an input to other two port network, in that case individual transmission parameters can be multiplied together to get the transmission parameters of the larger network
67 angle 0 degree ampere
so, if this were light would you be able to see the tower
5 but from the standard expected was 18
but if you have magnesium sulphate as the attacking solution you form an insoluble solid called magnesium hydroxide or brucite and this brucite because of its nature of insolubility keeps promoting the dissolution of calcium hydroxide, this forward reaction involving magnesium sulphate and calcium hydroxide is promoted to such an extent that you can actually lead to a complete removal of calcium hydroxide
so, the failure of absorbing boundary conditions is what we start with right; so, let us jump in to this discussion by starting by considering a lossy medium ok
but subsequent to nineteen, nineties, when ah, the devices started to scale down the mos transistors this is called technology scaling
now, let say we have done an up cast
the convention for this jacobian differs from people to people some people take the transpose of this as the jacobian whatever, but transpose does not alter determinant
5 right so if i put the value of different parameters as fy as 250 gamma m0 as 1
in this lecture, we will more focused about the circuit where the dependent sources are available, and we will try to solve the circuit for maximum power transfer
questions usually can be open ended or it could very tightly structured type of questions
so, i l is equal to from this circuit i l is equal to v thevenin by r thevenin plus r l
and ultimately uhhh desired amount of the return or the percentage of the return can be found out right
now the reason that we have to do this is because actually python does not allow us to create an empty list if we say something like l is equal to none and we want this to denote the empty list the problem is that none does not have a type as far as pythonõs value system is concerned
you pick some object; you will be in a position to draw
so, the question is if i just draw, i could have base and specialized as d which is basically public, or i could have base and there is no specific notation available
it is usually sound to just use dynamic programming as the default way to do the computation
so, in the first case where the steel reinforcement in the thai column which is in compression is also considered, then the axial force resistance, the total axial force equilibrium comes from the two, the location of this stress block
this is actually now operating only on the surface
and special case, this is the case when we have the gain stage connected to an attenuator
yes, that because any where inside and on the surface what is the electric field
unless i can access the next field of the node i cannot go to the next node on the list so i need to access them
so, again again again for your understanding initially i am showing everything, suppose i am moving clockwise; that means, i am moving like this moving like this, moving like this, clock wise, right
now there are two important positions in the company, chairperson and ceo
thank you for watching
we use top soil which is environmentally degradation in the environment which is today not acceptable and they are fired at very high temperatures which means that the embodied energy in manufacturing these bricks is rather high
so while during the decomposition we have to care that the number of connections between these partitions or subsystems must be minimized
we don't have the unlimited income so we always look for the quality
i am sure that during your undergrad or masters, you must have studied electronics instrumentation or applied physics or electrical engineering or mechanical engineering, and have come across discrete components
so, the right hand side which i evaluate now which now that i have done a little bit more carefully node 2 still gives me 0 as before and node 1 over here this is what i will replace over here ok
so, maybe we can zoom into this, so look very carefully this trapezoidal shape is there, you can see it let me draw maybe some lines
in that case again if you compare then there is a variance between the budgeted and the actual results
so rather than writing capital xl1 and so on i am writing this as small x1, fine
so this can also be used to carry the signal to various regions or zones
we have talked about the basic requirement of inheritance and we have touched upon; we have discussed the very core two concepts of the affects of inheritance between two classes, that is how does the data members are inherited and object layout done and how does the member functions can be inherited with overriding and over loading playing a role
in the worst case, the number of priority inversions suffered by a higher priority task can become unbounded and this situation can cause a high priority task to miss its deadline and therefore every real time application developer must take adequate precaution against unbounded priority inversion
it is nothing wrong if you do not recall; what is conductor, what is semiconductor, what is metal; all right, i will give you an example
the registration process is different for different rights the exclusive set of rights that patents and trademarks and copyright encompasses, they themselves can be different because of the subject matter being different
what is the supply current
what are those frictions
ok, it should be fairly clear till now
there are important points
so, first we will remove the load from the circuit
we also said there the question we are traced was: can we define a potential for magnetic fields
right and i intermediate into a new scalar variable, i called it rho
cmrr equals to ad by acm, so acm would be nothing, but 0
now, we can give this square wave to the clock input of our counter here and then it will count the number of edges and that will give us the frequency right
they have fairly not exactly accurately but fairly constant speed because you would see that series motor is just the other way round
tm polarization
in lc3 we looked at before what would be the composition 50% clinker, 30% calcine clay, 15% limestone and some gypsum and in each of this cases you see how much of electricity is required and how much of transportation is involved in the raw materials
so, this will be the te max, one thing one thing i would like to point out here in te max, te max does not depend on the rotor resistance at all, it does not depend on the rotor resistance, all though all along when we were talking about the torque, we always said i2 square r2 by s omega s
because i strongly believe that everyone knows matlab sim matlab simu link thing nowadays right
this is a slight settle point, because this divergence will give me v, grad, v dot d s over surface of shell plus surface at infinity, and that gives me zero
if you had a different kind of biasing or somehow modify this biasing so that this voltage is far above the gate voltage in quiescent condition, then the swing limit will be higher because the gate voltage can rise by a large amount and drain voltage fall by a large amount before the transistor enters triode region
so what is available as the induced emf which is actually giving me the relationship finally e1 by e2 equal to you know n1 by n2
so, now in this case, 15 volt source is there and this is 10 i and this is your v 1 1 upon 4 farad
delta t right so, that delta t the question can be should i have the variables being updated at the same delta t or some staggering over there as well
one is natural response and other is the forced response right
and, the best example is if for the sake of people who know and people want to study, one should study eric ericson’s
so, this is your unit ramp function delayed by t 0
so, this is the; this is the expression or the dynamics that governs the motion or movement of the moving coil at any instant, at any moment
so you can see your instrument but in that instrument there are apps, there are various other things which are loaded on instrument which don't have physical existence but which are of very much used to you
i guess he doesn’t have an ipad or a tablet or a mobile phone but i don’t know what he is up
to earn from my parents
suppose this is my q 0 is equal to i mean you write separately say q 0 is equal to omega 0l by r and again you write q 0 is equal to 1 upon omega 0 cr
but if we just compare this to solution side by side you will see that this is the c solution this is the corresponding c++ class
and the third move says: swap two adjacent operators and operands
i am making reference to a simple equivalent static procedure the modeling and analysis that will lead to a simple equivalent static procedure, the modeling and analysis that will lead to a simple equivalent static procedure
we have taken this image from the lecture given by professor bo cui and he is from waterloo
so this means that at regular intervals as the counter is incremented the comparator would check the number of clock cycles that elapsed or the number or amount of time that elapse and typically would give a value of zero after right amount of period has elapsed the comparator would provide an output of 1
so, if you have say seven different options, and you are only doing special things so 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7 are all the same then we can use else; we do not have explicitly enumerate all the other option
but sometimes it may be possible that it is not possible for the firms to recover the full cost of production that is both variable and the fixed cost
so, this is vgs minus vt square times the current factor and gm the expression we have been using is munc c ox w by l vgs minus vt
an electric field direction is in the direction of the current and, by boundary condition, right outside the surface
when we are looking at this kind of views if we already know cylinder of so and sodiameter just representing something like a rectangular portion showing long dash, short dash clearly indicates that it is a cylindrical object
how can we calculate the gain of a differential amplifier
and when current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to time rate of change of current
so, the reason is because i do not want you to miss out on the filters
so, store if it is not properly managed or maintained then the material can get spoiled there also and or that material can become obsolete and we will have to pay the cost for that
so there will not be any direct current flow from the high voltage side to the low voltage side or low voltage side to the high voltage side, so they are not conductively connected
we started from 50 ohms first we have a capacitor in shunt and then an inductor in series
so, now the usual problem is to find out the far field right
so, that's the gist of what we had seen in yesterday's lecture
and there are several items which do not form part of cash flow
the input stability circle does not touch the smith with unit radius at all
so, when the call is done, the function is in call
similarly, if these are cylindrical objects, we went ahead and showed the major diameters outside of the object through the symbol phi
next step will be 4th step which is expose it to u v light
but now we do not know how much is the electrical input
so, experiment you have some observation now we need some explanation why is it happening ok
inside we have a private implementation
then the activity is clearly marked as to what the person is going to do before, during and after and at least 3 steps, so this guys followed that
therefore, it is kind of agreed upon that content should be governing the decision of what way, it should be presented which should be supported by good and supportive appropriate visual and a strategy which will enhance the content communication
you got the process
so, with this we complete our discussion on personality
so you will get simply the value of rb
so it will be something like this: these legs can be treated as transmission lines
x is l by two
so, let me draw the op amp plus minus; you can give the input here, you can give feedback to the negative side; negative input like this is v o this is call this r 2 r 1, this is grounded which means this is what
so we discuss the asic design styles, in particular full customs, standard cell and gate array and the main issues involved there in for placement
so, this side if you take omega less than x 0 omega here what we call less than omega 0 right, this side omega less than omega 0; that means, your capacitance inductance your reactance x c right it is greater than your x l this side
see, this are the two parallel vdd and ground i am showing here
so basically, i have marked 4 points or 4 positions in the gauge length of the specimen, the first one is 100 mm gauge length which is equal to the axial extensometer, why
we already know the formula of summing amplifiers
if, the value is either 1 or 2 it would mean that aslr is enabled on that particular system
so, 173
only this part is different from this part
this, this bracket in bracket, whatever it is giving it for, it is for flat product
so, i put this and gate here and the other input of the and gate will decide how long or for what duration the accounting should continue
we need to have some communication through which my mobile phone and the microcontroller with which it is connected with the accelerometer should communicate
now this is very important because if you tell somebody that total net profit of our company is, let us say, 1,300 crores
one of them is in this direction; the other one is from this direction; the other one is from this direction
i can also write this as a function of vector r
so, call this point as n
for example, we have such kind of machine element, more like our screwdriver type, where this is the handle portion and there is some kind of tapered hexagonal kind of pattern
so, then let me write input equal input less than 0 will also imply output equal to v supply
so we will only consider the nodes which are not, the loops which do not have common notes for non touching loop gain
so, this we will say only acts on unprimed that is fine, so that is just a assumption
k surface current is percent unit length
so, e s x for example, what is the definition
so, imagine 2 triangles over there right
there is no difference between 1st angle projection and 3rd angle projection as long asfront view is concerned
can you think of a possibility where phi is non zero, but grad phi dot n hat is zero; what kind of a material would it be
let me move on to the second illustrative example and the second illustrative example is one that deals with a single story building again but with a rigid diaphragm and in this condition i would like to arrive at the diaphragm, the design forces for the different walls
this is half wave rectified, but it is full wave rectified i have to again draw on the top of this also one more voltage right
and next one is an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy, i told you earlier right
there is a slight subtlety over here let us write this a little bit carefully
the term that is left is what is the term that is left only second term right
there will be a comparator, which will be checking whether this feedback, whatever you are reading is less than or greater than the set goal
if there is a difference then we will use the fourth formula but if the total time is same summing up scaled, semi scaled and unscaled workers time then we will be going to use the in case of the labor mix variance or the gang composition variance the formula number 2
when contrast the grid routing algorithms which you discussed, they are used, not directly associated with global or detail routing, but whenever we run into some problem, we use are routing because area routing is considered to be one where you can find path between two points which are otherwise not so easy to connect
it could have a series resistance, it could be a current source and so on because all the arguments we will make now will be general and in terms of only the port variables
so, this is having a cylindrical structure, at least and it will not have much of opportunity to get deformed
so, they will bring; they will treat and person becomes alright, but then he has no work he has no work, he is empty
this is d, so we are interested in line d
let us just keep it in the passive region
so, let us write first the network equations for these two two port networks
now if id is too large, that is, id is larger than i 0, then this current will be negative, current will be drawn out of the top plate of this capacitor
so z axis will show me the current either going into the board or coming out of the board
r square right, but here what do we see electromagnetic fields 1 by r far away from the sort of this smallest building block of an antenna which is a hertz dipole, gives me a 1 by r ok
you see in this typical curve here we have a resistance of the order of mega ohms, and on this point we have a resistance of the order of hundreds of ohms
how this will affect on the op amp circuit, we had psrr of 90 6 db we will have was 63000
the name of this protocol is a m q p advanced messaging queuing protocol, ah
and your b terminal is your negative right, it is negative, so that means when it is v a b this is positive, this is negative, it is v a b you can write v a b, arrow means positive arrow means positive, and here no arrow means negative
let me explain once again; this is more like a welded kind of thing portion what we are trying to see here, but the cylinder line comes there
that is the reason i am trying to conduct this test by applying the voltage on the low voltage side, just for logistics reason, right
a business is something, which continues over a period of time selling goods and services to customers, so the quality was required or some kind of a guarantee was expected for a business to continue
this is the current and voltage relationship for a capacitor, assuming positive sign convention the relationships shown in figure 5
so, determine i 1, i 2 and i 3 of the circuit as shown in figure 3 by using node voltage method, right
so, power loss is high, but here from this diagram we can make out i dash; if you take it is magnitude i dash actually compared to this i is decreasing
so, if you come back to figure 29 it is here , this is the , just hold on, is just the same figure where where you have derive the formula right this is the figure 30 and this is your this is the figure in this figure right
if i give 0 and 1, q will become 0
now we shall see a little later how compaction is different from compression
that is why you will find industry the shunt capacitors are always there
so fro time t ranging between zero to two this will be zero so finally we are left with only only this will will which will become one and e to the power minus t minus lambda because this the u lambda is one for t greater than zero so when you will solve you will get the value of this i naught t between time t zero to two as one minus e by t minus and p f
so, let us spend some time interpreting equation 2 so, equation 2 it is a three dimensional equation in the variables k x, k y, k z right and this e x, e y, e z all of these are numbers some numbers that i choose
and nonsense syllables are basically very generously used in research in psychology, because it helps you understand learning in its purest form
no problem i calculate this, but this summation goes over all the pulses
so, externally we connect 64k
if you do so, then this equation becomes this equation
so let me clear up this clutter here
so, the first variety is what is what would be called local abc ok
so, i can take all the metal parts and say this is
this is the posture of a person who is willing to accept the proposal for example, where do i signed now to move on further
and if you start doing the mesh analysis or nodal analysis it will take a lot of time and it will be almost impossible to do it in a reasonable time frame
so, this is the x1y1 axis above that point because it is a vertical plane, projection also front view
if there is a node n who does not want temperature, you will simply not subscribe to it
so, this is this term is called grid another term that we will encounter in finite difference time domain
now, for such type of things if i go for aggregating data then of course, now i get a compromised score wherein certain valuable information will be lost
so we employed couple of methods one was the multi why approach
now let us consider this circuit once again
the firm has earned during the year it is the shareholders share it has to go to the shareholders versus there is a time period allowed under the indian companies act 3 months
and i think the use of the bundle of information may be used for that
so, the solution to the limitations of the master budget is the flexible budgets and variance analysis
this end gate will be enabling the clock and the clock will come
so, we can so, we must consider the 2 extreme possible values of r that is when r is equal to infinity and when r is equal to 0
ok, this is the you can see in this step when you are talk about transistor layout
so what i have tried to show you in this lecture is that you can think of the energy of a charge distribution as if it is stored in the electric field produced by this, with the energy density one half epsilon zero e square, and we have seen through three examples that this gives you the same answer as we obtained earlier with the direct formula
and this is the load connected for the sake of our calculations easy calculations are for the sake of explanation
it looks like this
and here, wattmeter reading gives only iron or core loss
it means 60% is the cost of goods sold and 60% includes the material as well as the other expenses
so, if i wanted to solve this problem in frequency domain, i have to solve for various omegas; then take the inverse fourier transform and get the time response
you are able to change or automatically the other figures or the other values are changed automatically
so, you have two electrons in the s, two electrons in the p, they hybridize to form 4 s p 3 hybrid orbitals
if you cannot serve their needs be the best product, you don't have the right to be in the business
now the sale is reduced either to the eastern market, central india or the northern part of india
1 if you divide 100 by your your what actually this will become approximately 7
these are simple schedulers
so now we have to convert that into the proportion of 2 by 10
so, the same function append is being use throughout
so, r here is the distance between the electron and the ionize impurity
the nominal development time, again we have seen the equation for nominal development time earlier
now, in this case what we have to do
but it is also interesting to see where the additional resistance, where the global resistance to earthquake, favourable earthquake response of confined masonry constructions come from and simple calculations can actually be done to estimate the improved flexual capacity of walls when you have confinement and improved shear capacity when you have confined confinement by the confining elements in reinforced concrete
so, if you this thevenin equivalent if it is converted to the your what you call a current source and 6 ohm will be in parallel right with this
so, your v p upon z y right
so, as you know and indivisible part of a capacitor consisting of electrodes separated by dielectric material this you know; perhaps you might have seen in the, you know laboratory also and next is the capacitor unit
d1 the first activity in during learning, yeah
second, we have to pick the views which one is front view
this is called your saturation temperature, so that within the between the saturation and intrinsic your concentration of electrons which is your majority concentration is within 10 percent of the donor concentration part e, you are asked to sketch a schematic
so, perhaps this is the center from there it might be at r5 units
in other words all this are all are underlines a linear circuit is one output is directly proportional to its input right output is directly proportional to its input, then the circuit is called a linear circuit
now here on the other terminal of the add adder we are having a dc voltage and here i have given minus 0
a side view projected on to profile plane
and then we talk about the cleaning, say next thing is the cleaning up time, cleanup of spilled solvents
so i am having a reduction in the field energy and the reduction is the field energy is this shaded area
lets clear this screen and lets try the round robin part of the direct exchange
now, these two incline lines, we are observing it on this plane
project d on to horizontal plane, then use this radius transfer that all the way down
7 mm diameter which is typically used in pretension concrete systems and the next one of 15
in phase, in phase means your input is this right their output can be in phase or out output can be out of phase, and this part is feedback to the input that should be in phase with the input, it should be in phase
so, te case what are my variables
its component is cosine theta, so it's going to be cosine of theta
so, point piecewise constant approximation i can make for or if k is something more complicated there is no problem what will i do for this term
iso is international standards, sae is society of automotive engineers, asme is american mechanical engineering associations and bis is bureau of indian standards
as you see it these equations do not have frequency directly anyway right
so, whenever i do short pitching i cannot say that i am going to have actually, originally i should have e plus e, i should have had one of them as e another one also as e
so, an entire family of thin, ultra thin, strong motors are being prepared today particularly to take care of this twin requirement of keeping joints thin but giving adequate protection to the steel reinforcement
that means that means if for balanced voltage, magnitude v a n is equal to magnitude v b n is equal to magnitude v c n right
so, and this is the opposite term here it is r 1 you divided by you divide it by r 1 right
you need to check each one of them to see if they are right or wrong
even in official presentation we find that as a general rule we present the easy portions of our message and presentation in a faster speed and the complicated parts of the information are passed on in a slow manner
i am going to have this angle to be 30 degrees, which is corresponding to 180 minus whatever is the short pitch angle
now, the next goal is to be able to apportion this floor shear qi that we established in the previous slide to the different walls themselves and then to the separate resisting elements within the wall
so essentially using these, any controlled source can be built using negative feedback
and therefore what we will examine from the next lecture is how you could actually model a masonry structure using an equivalent frame approach
now first task is that again we have to transform this into frequency domain
so, this is your if you apply your what you call that kcl at node 2 this is the equation
so t1a, at the end of t1a it must leave the system with a consistent state
so initially we have this processor and as we know that there is a cache memory which caches some of the recently used data and then we have the large lower cache memory of the data
without water being there in the system you really will not have any durability problems
so, synchronous impedance is going to be the ratio of the current obtained under short circuit condition at rated if
we can do the same thing for b equation and we get in the b equation is curl
for example, we can have one is a straight line other one is a curve
if i am straight away looking from side view, it will be up to this portion we will be in a position to see
here i would also like to point out that there is a variation between the speed of speech and the speed of comprehension
what does a distractor do
so from here we get this is nothing but vo the reflected wave at the source upon vo+2gama x
integrator means it will integrate a lot of things in one
you you have a simplified model that you can estimate that this is the delay of my gate
does not function properly means it will get damaged, in this case assuming plus minus 15 volts apply the input should stay below plus minus 13 volts right
when via is 0, this is at 0 volts, and the output is also at 0 volts
so, f must be in the range of l that is kind of obvious, but i am just stating it anyway ok
now retrospective memory, if you think that today i submitted documents to the bank, you have already performed the task and you remember okay
so here is the pulse coming and it is getting transmitted after sometime
another way to do that is to have a hetero structure based device
and, they are widespread in terms of shipbuilding and the other one is shoe industries also is quite popular
that will be shown as intangible asset under development
whenever we have different set, different voltage or current sources operating at different frequencies we will see that the value of inductance and capacitance c not the value of inductance and capacitance, we will say that it is the impedance offered by the inductance and capacitance will be different
so, for today i will request my another teaching assistant for this particular course, and he will be showing you how we can perform this experiment
the flux lines are still flowing through every lamination without any problem, are you getting this point
it happens regardless of any apply voltage that means, that you see motion at absolute is zero, slight heating will cause a random fluctuation or motion of the electrons
5 for site welding gamma mw gamma mw is a partial safety factor for weld connection and this value can be taken as 1
so, our sales are 700,700,000 so, how much expenses are going to be here
so, you have to be careful in terms of using delete object
so, that the line to line voltage is impress across the capacitor that is why you are taking x is equal to v line to line upon i c
11,500 kgs and what is the inside the bracket
initially you call it the seed
so, we will say how to do that
this is figure 19 a right aand the wwe have also have to perform a simulation, that i will talk it talk in a second
so, if we have to swap then the copy operators are copy constructor in the copy assignment operator has to be there in the available trait of the function parameter a type parameter t
the closer they are, the lesser will this second level of reflection
if your material is a direct band gap material then this recombination will dominantly produce light and the energy of the light is just given by the band gap
you write here operating profit per ton per unit
so, here we will have horizontal plane
in the normal flow of execution; the instructions are normally stored one after the other in memory, pc points to the next instruction to be executed
they are 330 and minus 38
therefore, i0 produces the flux and in the phase with the flux
but the picture is somewhat incomplete because with the transistors that we have, we can only have currents that are being pulled from a node
let us see what is the problem in a realistic antenna ok
so lets look into it
so when you are doing timing optimization as a subsequent step to timing analyzes, you are identifying the critical portions of your design, like, for example, the portions where the slacks are negative
so, this is what we are going to be examining
so, now, you have designed this part and you have other parts already ready
so induction starts, synchronous run motors are generally used only in somewhat lower capacity, some of the clocks, microwave turntables where you wanted to rotate at a particular speed, constant speed
but we also found that there are, it may also affect the durability related properties or transport properties, one example here i am showing is the water sorptivity index, so here how we do is you take a disk of concrete and then you put that, place that in a small water bath not immersed but just place like this what is shown in the picture and then you weigh the you know see how much water is absorbed by the, because of this soption by the concrete disk
now during the 2nd access to the same table at the index p4 xor k4 there are 2 things that can occur
i will not redraw the circuit, the ah details of it, but please do go through this specification
similarly, for i b and i c so, will go back to that
but when we come to solving a case, we will consider other ratios as well
next that r n or r that r norton is equal to your r thevenin same thing
so we will consider a task set on schedulable under rma but schedulable in edf and then of course we can find the two schedulers produce different schedules
see we wrote i rated multiplied by z equivalent divided by v rated as percentage z equivalent or per unit z equivalent, i can similarly write, i rated multiplied by r equivalent divided by v rated will give me percentage r equivalent, instead i can multiply and divide by i rated, so what i will get will be i rated whole square multiplied by r equivalent divided by kva basically because v rated multiplied by i rated is kva
first of all, we have to draw an xy line
but the input is concentration, right
so, first one is input bias current ib1 and ib2
this tells two things this says the value is empyt list, so it is also tells python the fn denotes the lists these are the two steps going on here as we see
so the power is flowing in this direction right
so, now we need to think about the manufacturing of the csa based cement using industrial byproducts, because that will drastically reduce the cost, okay
so, we have seen all the kind of filters possible filters that i can show it to you quickly in the part of as a part of this particular curriculum or part of this particularor course
because 3 phase generation started only later, initially it was all dc generation
so, this area actually projected area of the conductor covered without ice in square meter per meter length, because we have consider 1 meter length right, 1 meter length and this one ani is equal to cross section area of conductor covered without ice in square meter and your l is equal to length of the conductor in meter
so you take the worst case limits from all the limits imposed by transistors
that this is one 80 degree, then this is 270 degree, and when it will come to this one it is 360 degree, right
so, in addition to all of these columns, there are other columns like this
sometimes it can also be related with simple curiosity for example, a child is staring a phenomena for a long duration
and another are oscilloscopes, which are 2 on whichere i have my hand on 2 oscilloscopes, all right
now, interim dividend is a f type of item
a classical example that i can give you is a city like chennai which was till 2002 in seismic zone 2 moves in 2002 to seismic zone 3 which would mean that the earthquake demand prescribed by the code is now different seismic code to seismic zone 2 as per the original code requirement pre 2002 for zone 2 you don don't have to do a seismic design
let us look at some of the older generations of arm
what we are going to now say is that is the charge distribution, given here rho r prime itself creates a field around it that means, it distorts something around it
so, this you can write s load is equal to your 1398 plus j 1113 volt ampere right
gamma ins are the reflections coefficients at the junctions of the various sections, now here we assume that all the sections have identical electrical lengths & this is given by beta1l1 is equal to beta2l2 is equal to beta 3l3 equal to some value say theta
so, it will be e to the power minus 2 t upon 3 now voltage across the inductor is v is equal to l into di by dt l is 0
because already after one day the computer reports that contain water twelve nanometers in size
5 times d where d is the diameter of the bolt similarly in case of bolt diameter from 16 to 22 this standard clearance is 2 mm over site is 4 mm short slot in case of that it is 6 mm and for all the cases it is 2
armature you are having ac right commutator and brushes we put only because what we are having inside is ac what comes out is dc by the split ring
so, it is a pure short circuit, if you make either of this either this one r 2 is equal to 0 or r 1 is either of this you make short circuit, and both 0 also short circuit, right
so, this is e1 = minus n1 d ∅ /dt
so that means that like in the previous case there must be a negative incremental gain between vs and vg
and if you change that, you can actually get a solution in the form of, well he doesn’t or she doesn’t have to travel, they do not have to travel all the way to the workshop
so, i want to define my own addition, where if i add two enums from my domain that is c0, c1 and c2 this is again the same enum type, what i want is; the result will always be within this enum type
similarly, when i talk about inverting, non inverting amplifier, immediately you should be able to say there was a case on it; a differential amplifier vo is nothing but minus r f by r1 into v 2 minus v 1 or r f by r1 into v 2 minus v 1
so, this debate has continued
so, edges let us see how to do
you pour your concrete, right, and then measure the early age expansion
otherwise if p 2 minus p 1 negative mean loading capacity right
so, this is just for the sake of explanation i have taken this diagram from a book right
calculate the phase and line currents look, z delta is given 8 plus j 4, that is 8
so, this is actually what you call this mechanism
so, quadrature is a very greatly simplifying thing because it does not need me to know the detailed analytical integration of whatever right
so, from equation 1, one may we may define that capacitance is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to the voltage difference between the two plates right
so, in that case, what will happen after going on increasing the current right, the domains actually begins to align and the resulting relationship between b and h is shown by the curve o g b right
now we are producing 30,000 one units and because of that your fixed cost has remained as fixed that is 150,000
so, on the profits which you have earned in 9, you will have to pay some money to government, that is the taxes
once it is done from d point, we have to go along that stop it where it is going to intersect 2
but lets see what will happen here
so, now how do i define the impulse response
and what is the 60% that is going to be $420,000
so inductance is here normally measured in henry
so, you can easily calculate it that is 1
that is called as a book profit
you can see that now you can add up the two shear forces 253
till then you take care i will see you in the next module bye
you deposit thin layer thin layer of chrome or chromium on the oxidized silicon wafer
so, it will start from all 0 that means, all these outputs are logical low
so, the first part can actually be very easily shown
i do not want to be storing electric field at halftime integer instance also
the first one is straight line method
yeah you can do that
but before we move to oscilloscopes, let us first understand what is the function generator is, and what is the role of function generator is, all right
and at this node, at the output node, we can consider either current flowing into the node or away from the node
once because of the when your when your writing your for this coil it will be it was m d i is the d t will comefor this coil because of this coil and for m d i d t will come here because of this coil
let us construct that step by step
to understand the difference between direct and indirect band gap semiconductor some more, we can also look at the band structure
so i should show this is b this should also be b
and rg is much more than rl from the first condition
let us discuss the techniques which we will use for the measurement of three phase power
so, that is your v 3 i 3 and z 3 z 3 here is decrease value right because of that ah series capacitor
so, we have the bands bending on the n side up, we have bands bending on the p side down, so that is how the junction forms
it is essential because in this case we are looking at one side being the windward side and the other side being the levered side
now, at t 0 you see we are at the extreme left
so, it means we'll have to say that we want to pay on time when the due date comes, we don't want to delay the payment and that due date will come as for the terms given by the suppliers
cash available for the operations is only $4,000
so for lying a, the word will be zero, one one, zero
now, one thing we noticed is that if the z smith chart is rotated 180¡ with respect to the y smith chart, then we can combine the 2 and form what is called as zy smith chart, where a point with respect to the z smith chart will also satisfy the position requirement for the y smith chart
now the basic idea of this nuclear magnetic resonance is nuclear magnetic relaxation and what happens basically if you think about the water molecules in this bottle of water here, the magnetic spins of those protons are fairly randomly oriented
so, electron beam evaporation is a physical vapor deposition process that allows the user to evaporate the materials that are difficult or impossible to process using standard resistive thermal evaporation right
and notice that this table is empty, even though we know the base case of fibonacci of 0 and fibonacci of 1 are 0 and 1 respectively, we do not assume you know it, because it will come out as the first time we hit the base case it will come out of the recursive definition
it is just doing basically aligning and realigning of these magnetic domains
and on top i will get two times x minus x prime
59 kg, this is your t max
pq is 60 millimeter long and is parallel to and 15 mm from both horizontal plane and vertical plane
so, this exist something around it that i am calling the electric field and it is direction and magnitude is given by force is applied on a unit charge
and especially we will learn this isometric box method in using an example
so, because of all these factors, it is actually as we shall see, it is actually easier to design a resonator as compared to equivalence of lumped components in microwave engineering
so the transmission can take place both along a conductor using the normal voltage current relationships that we know
when does it reach steady state, that's when this current going into the parasitic capacity is 0, that is when id equals i 0
a big dash line followed by a small dash again big dash small dash this is the way we represent an axis
now what is the difference with return on equity and return on capital
each section produces a phase shift of 1800 degree of the ac signal voltage and hence it produces a sine wave
this line you can omit we do not need this
he was very excited at this proposition because he was surrounded by people’s inventions, people's greatest ideas presented in all its detail
the instructor provided definitions of current, voltage to students, explained them about series and parallel circuits, explained about ohm's law and solved some problem questions
we just did the calculation for gallium arsenide
we don't jump to the total cost because exercising the control in that case will be very, very difficult
so, what is the geometric picture you can think of how, what am i doing to my function
for example, you want to make a laptop, design a laptop; then this kind of reference planes always be helpful, let us click ok
you know that the electron is negative negative charged particle while proton is positive charged particle
so, any line parallel to vertical plane may be in that direction, maybe in that direction we will have, but it should not make any inclination angle with vertical plane, this is the first condition
so, the same structure i can retain
in the last class, we have learned about power trim
yes, r prime is the location of the receiver
so, this is just the tip of all the major semantics that we need to understand in terms of understanding how to use inheritance and how to model different real world scenario of hierarchy in a very efficient manner in the c++ language
it is time domain right
they can handle very large circuits quite easily because their computation and complexity is not so high
now, you guys understood that if ground both the terminals vin also with respect to v plus then also i will see that my output voltage is not 0, but i will find some amount of voltage that voltage is due to the input bias current have you got it, why that voltage is there that voltage due to the input bias current right and a typical bias current of op amp is nothing, but 80 nano ampere, it results that when no input voltage that is vin equals to 0 that op amp has a feedback resistance of 1 mega ohm, the op amp will produce an output voltage of vout equals to 80 nano ampere into 1 mega ohm which is nothing, but 18 millivolts ok
so, the only possible term that might simplify in this volume integration is which one, what about the very last term
so, p 2 will be p l 2 then plus p l 3 plus p l 4 similarly, q 2 will be q l 2 q l 3 plus q l 4 q l 2 plus q l 3 plus q l 4, right
so, this is 3 vx this is 1 ohm this is 2 ohm and then you have 4 ohm and you need to find out the thevenin resistance
so, you can think of a box cons1sts of many latch kind of events
use stress is a positive side of stress, and distress is the
in this process we can have some kind of application maybe it as a web application or an app in your mobile phone, it should able to tell me the current location of my child
so now, you are depositing this material by incident by incident thing the electron beam right by incident in the electron beam on the material which is loaded in the crucible and that is done with the help of filament accelerating gate deflection plates and the bending magnet
so what we will do like before we will go to this folder where i have now created the schematic and i'm naming it as a buck close
if you want the really high conductivities that we see in the extrinsic semiconductors can actually calculate that the temperature change must be much higher, this is one of the reason why intrinsic semiconductors are almost never used in the case of devices
so, just rc filter will have dc gain of less than unity; but when you use a unity gain amplifier it will have a dc gain of one
say, for example, i wanted to test a system for als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
most of the routing areas are available for me, so initially let me use the lee ah, not lees the first algorithm, the line search, let say height hours algorithm, are used
if it is 4 ampere, what will happen
that i am talking about, first equation is it a scattered field appearing in the variable edge
so, load is twelve point 5 kva because 10 by 0
so i have applied some test input, lets say t
this can be your structural view
so, sin omega t minus 90 that is e1 right; that means, if ∅ = the reference that is your sin omega t right and it is a loss is neglected
now how to use this function generator, and how to see the display on some other equipment
now, that was the basic noise definition
otherwise it is definitely a function of feature very clearly when they are in alignment i will have the maximum inductance when then they are not in alignment i am going to have you know at 90 degrees i am going to have minimum inductance,right
and to para phrase what nitin said how do you communicate the concept because you have a product i mean you do have i know what do you mean by i do not have a product it is a conflict, so on the one hand you have something like a prototype it is not a full fledge product like you would see in the market, you pick it up of the shelf it is not that, but neither is it an idea that in one of our heads or in shared concept, we can see it in the front, so how do i really convince somebody that this is the exact concept i have in my mind, this is just a sort of reflection of that
and initially we say that list1 points to this and list2 points to this in the last assignment say that list3 also points to this
these days, means as per the company's act 2013, the income statements are prepared in the vertical order, not in the ones which i told you
this would be the max
which means it is going to work like a capacitor
you may start with the topic by asking the learners to construct an initial concept map which provides diagnostic assessment as well as leads the learners to think over the content
so you see, once we have defined the bounding box, we expect that all pins has to be there
so, the research or the instruction exception existed in the us law as well, but this came more to ensure the products that are developed in the universities
we have to ensure that the width of this pml layer which is in your hand had better be large enough that the wave decays inside the wave supposing it does not supposing you know you have only so much ram on your computer and you can only fix you know thin layer
thus, the attacker would know that the value of i in other words the contents of that kernel space memory has a value of 84
p into e is the external moment and this external moment we can equal with the moment resistance by the bolt in tension and compression
and this all has been possible or would be possible if you control the material cost and the labour cost
one of the crucial issue that arises when tasks share resources and we don't have adequate support for resource sharing is a priority inversion problem
i have etched this wafer this metal chrome gold in gold agent and second in chrome agent in between i have rinse it with the help of di water; i have rinse it with di
ellipsoid
then gives me partial e y, partial x is equal to minus partial b, which is in z direction, partial t, because these two terms also cancels
this is the program, and let us see the demo now
so, let us take 1 triangle over here inside like this and 1 triangle over here inside ok
so, this is this is open circuit, so what is the current flowing through this the i
two main methods that we have seen are surface and volume integrals
5, the actual output, standard cost also be changed, then the say your mix also we have to revise and then we have to, similarly we have to go for the yield also, so we have to calculate the standard
so, v is equal to v r plus v l plus v c, because this all these things all these things are given
like you have a direct connection like this from the output of one flip flop to the other, its says how much skew between c one and c two can be tolerated
so, this timer 2 is now getting a clock of 3 into 28800 hertz
and here we can see the capacitor and the resistor
so these are the two challenges: how to integrate the system on a micro cantilever assembly
so if we want to just cascade large number of unit cells then it is very easily possible since the image impedance at the input and the output is constant
if, it is a 4th quadrant this is one plane, this is the one the point projected onto vertical plane
so, to represent that, the easiest way is representing the sectional view
1 6th is that for the linear elastic, the key situation where you have no tension but full compression and then 1 quarter and 1 3rd where you start getting tension in the cross section
so, finally, i call this type as staff
a coupled line coupler consists of 2 pieces of transmission line which are side by side
and that means, entire volume is going to be equal to v dot d s over the outside surfaces, because d s is all pointing a perpendicular pointing away from this surface
but in truth in true that is in experimental op amps in practical op amps, you will see that the gain is gain is very high is about this much value, around this much value ok
so, you can see here my pinch off happens early compared to vgs
using the principles of negative feedback, we have come up with a topology for a voltage control voltage source with gain of one using a single moss transistor
usually this sections representation helps us to improve clarity and reveal interior features of the parts
extend this p2 all the way from one of the generator line
resistance is still there
so, in which case, we call that as salient pole because they are having specifically some portions highlighted
and likewise we have a positive slope, negative slope when the bjt is on vin by l is the positive slope and the bjt is of minus v0 is appearing across the l and the down slope negative minus v0 by l
as discussed in the previous lecture the frequency of this waveform is a function of these manufacturing process of this puf
28 by 2 so if we calculate this we can find out value as 61 kilonewton so force to resist at lower site of the angle p3 will be total force minus p1 minus p2 so p3 we can find out that will be 303
we said that the lcm contains an integral number of frames or in other words the frame divides the major cycle
therefore your omega 2 upon simplification you take omega minus omega 1 common
so this is a generic control switch could be an igbt, a mosfet or a bt
so, it may be possible that we will get exactly this value
so, now we will calculate the material price variance and we will take calculate this variance first for the material a, right
body language as always cultural specific and therefore, in all my discussions i have tried to point out the cultural differences in the interpretations
20 millimetres above horizontal plane above 20 it can be here it can be there, but it is 25 millimetres behind vertical plane
we introduce a redial member function to be able to redial a member function
because i am worried about the electrical quantity
now, this that figure 6 shows the rotor circuit at slip s this is the induced voltage say rotor circuit
so if i want a very very precise control mechanism for the speed, where i cannot tolerate any oscillations in the speed even small oscillations in the speed i cannot go for single phase machine and another thing is whenever i am going to see there is oscillation in the speed there will be more vibrations, there will be more noise
so we're looking at a laboratory test where the wall panel that you're looking at is a shear wall
so, we are making a voltmeter circuit and this is the input in for i n input and what we will like to have is that for say positive cycle if current flows like this ok
but of course, nothing prevents me from taking two things like the transistor and the current source and connecting them together
yw means the cg of the area from the neutral axis, so cg of the area
so, whenever this is in this is what you coil and this is actually frequency domain that is this is 2 dot and this is a mutual reactance j omega m which is written here, this is j omega l 1 and this is directly j omega l 2rest are same right
so we will take up specifically generator first then we will go into the motor
and therefore, as a corollary, we've also learnt that b can be expressed as curl of a vector potential, which we kept calculating
so, what is the physical problem over here
what this will mean is any symbol that is subsequently used after this; you will try to check if this namespace name 1 has that symbol
in numeric terms, this will return 165 correctly
so, if the data array has size 5, then it has a 5 quintuple denoting all the characters that, this data array has and then another component top which is the value of top
you have a rotating magnetic field caused by this bearing
similarly, i cd will be v fg in to y cd
now, how far does this go
this comes out to be 4
if mu is greater than 1 it corresponds to either that this stability circle has its center at the origin of gamma s or gamma l plane and it has a radius greater than the radius of the smith chart or that this stability circle completely outside this smith chart and therefore it satisfies the condition of modulus of position of center minus the radius of the stability circle is greater than 1
so, i will close in here
so, let us first see how mosfet looks like in terms of schematic diagram ok
it is lighter with respect to other building material
now the easy thing about using a current source is that when you have a number of series paths, the same current flows through all of them and that can lead to some simplification
now you see, if this is a conductor, field inside has to be zero
i have shown in terms of a function name just as a indicative one, but in reality, certainly, the application would have would be in couple of thousands of lines
suppose c two is coming after inverter delay
so, which means i am going to have excess reactive power returned to the three phase supply
let us construct that on our sheet
click first point, then click second point, freely move your hands
therefore, it is easy to see that under highest locker protocol chain blocking cannot occur
so let’s look at some of the examples we looked at last time
periodic or cyclic condition for the si
say for example if we draw this figure whatever we have seen and this is a column which is connected by a weld
so, this is as a matter fact in that course this is the first time i am introducing a medium a specific medium
so, ns is equal to your 120 into 50 divided by 4 right
it can, it will basically overlap at some point or become higher in value in terms of tau with respect to the second criterion
for example, m n are numbers, similarly i, j and f at each step are numbers
to some extent we we cannot do as good as external testing, but what best we can do, let see that
once it is done wherever we will feel these maximum dimensions that maximum dimensions we are going to show it on that object
earlier we had only our circuits under test, but now we have a test generator, we have a response compactor
so we have stator and rotor are the 2 portions in an electrical machine where they may be accommodating, one will be accommodating field which will produce magnetism, the other one may be accommodating the bunch of conductors in which electricity is produced which we call as armature
there is no sign, right
2 milliseconds, that is, what is the output of each of these half periods, it will be ramped
so, please understand this again and again if i am talking about actually an armature and if i am connecting a small resistance, i am going to demand more current, for a given voltage if i connect smaller resistance i am demanding more current that means i am loading the machine more
after this what we will do you will expose using uv
so, you would find that the smile, its presence, its absence, and too much presence are all noted by all our interactants
the basic principle of inheritance is i have some concepts which is this and i am trying to specialize to provide a more special concept which need to satisfy everything that the general concept satisfies
ignore magnetizing current right
it is like paramagnetic material but takes in many more lines and very weak field outside
that is one of the means optimization criteria in the step right
so, factors of 0 is 1, factors of 0 colon 1 the slice is also 1, but here we have a single value here we have a list and therefore, these two things are not equal to each other right
so, of course, we need methods that are we have to be safe means no radiation damage, and if this big divide between rural india and urban india has to be bridged then it has to be inexpensive quick
can you visual it any difference between these two
i may constant use of it especially, in conversations, i am digging for information if we show a conversation partner that we are interested and approve what they say, they tend to get more talkative
next one is
input signal was 1 volt, output signal will become 10 volts, right, this what we have seen
so, you can you can use this individual bits for different port as different port bits ok
so, this is actually the voltage at t is equal to 5
i have drawn it here, right
and as we see over here, on the x axis it shows the hamming distance between a and b and the y axis shows the probability
so, we were continuing to use the complex as a class
then you determine, you plot the chloride content versus the depth in the concrete then this is fick’s second law, you fit this curve to this whatever the data which you collect, you fit that to the fick’s second law equation and then you determine this value here, what is diffusion coefficient
ah, you can say, i mean it is by difficult to even think about doing this steps in a manual fashion, because it will take years to do even a very simple, small part of it
so, the derivative of the; it is underlined only the derivative of the unit step function u t is the unit impulse function
so, the basic idea is that this is the inertia times the angular acceleration, this should be same as the sum of all the three types of forces damping force, spring torque and the deflecting torque ok
i will say the same operator remains similar ok
if you use it, see, basically gets oxidised definitely and when it gets oxidised, unless you remove the oxidation portion, the resistance will not decreased
so, this direction we have to pick it this is a good choice for picking front view compared to this one
75, any eccentricity less than 1 we will be getting this ellipse and distance of focus from the directrix is 70 mm, if that is the case construct an ellipse
a bright field mask, we have here photoresist positive, we have here sio2 and i am exposing with uv; i am exposing with uv
now, to meet that learning outcome what you should do is to create simulations of virtual environment for learners to know the environment, provide opportunities for learners to be able to play with the different parameters and features inside the software and also be able to see the results of their actions
we are not going to pay that whole amount in the month of january
so, the difference between first approach and second approach is that – in first approach we assume input as known and we take some assumption that the input given to the circuit is maybe unit step or something like that
so, l for example, is you know d by d r, if i multiply r prime r prime has no relation to r right
depending on λ you can choose the appropriate detector
how we will connect them
because the amount of wire which is required for 3 phase system is lesser than the amount of wire needed for an equivalent 3 single phase systems
and also, the scopes may be nested, like block scope, class scope, namespace scope; they may be nested
from this equation you guess that for the steady state values; steady state value k p is responsible k p and in this case those speed governing mechanism
so the concept is that for every line in the circuit we associate a fault list
so, we have completed the test now and we will look at the stress strain plot of the trc element and see what are different characteristics that is involved in a trc element subjected to tensile stress
ok, now, one very important issue is that routing is important because inter connections in a typical chip can take us to an overrate of almost thirty percent, or even more of the design time as well as the area over it
this current and this v 0 you can assume whatever you want 1 volt 2 volt
so basically you fill your tube with cement slurry and using this gauge you can monitor the change in length, right
similarly, for checking empty you pass the stack s to the global function empty, here empty is a member function
the inductor design is also along similar lines as we discussed for the transformer with few minor variations now let me start in this fashion we know that flux is equal to mmf by reluctance now this is equal to permian's into mmf
he does not like what he hears, he does not like what he sees
ripples; ripples were in the point or even closer to home in when you are have a bath, you put water in your bucket you see ripples like this right on the surface of the water right
e g slightly lower is around 1
so, you got y 11 and y 21 from this circuit
so, if we can recover this by increasing the price of the final product in the market because hr cost has gone up and it is not because of any one's fault
so, the voltage at a given point in time and distance is found by adding all terms that are directly above that point
so this is just a very simple example i have given, but here we shall be looking at much more delay, ah, delay related issues and other problems there in in our next modules, where we discussed these things in detail
now, thus, how you can define input bias current
first, let us recap what we discussed in the last class
so in this part two we continued discussion and look at some of the other steps which are also very important in the physical design cycle
but when omega t is equal to 90 degree if you put 90 degree then v is equal to 0
so, therefore, since when the now when the capacitor voltage is maximum the inductor current is 0 and vice versa when; that means, when capacitor voltage here it is this point 0 in this your what you call this inductor current is maximum or when inductor current is 0 this point capacitor voltage is maximum vice versa
so most of the energy that is going towards magnetising the entire structure goes into actually magnetizing the air gap because the air gap is difficult to magnetize you are going to have higher and higher reluctance
these are again uhpc pi girders, pi girders are called pi girders because they have a shape of the greek alphabet pi and these are very common bridge girder elements
so, these are the 3 topics that are still pending
we also have one more course on cost accounting which will discuss about the accounting issues related to costs
so, let us say what would happen if we print this particular line, so, printf percentage x, buffer 2
so, this x here sin of tan inverse l over 2 x which actually becomes again i cancel this 2 with this and give you 2 to get 2 q lambda over 2 pi epsilon 0 1 over x sin of tan inverse l over 2 x is going to be l divided by square root of l square plus 4 x square, that is the answer for f x
and if you have several design alternatives, you should have a way to compare their speeds
engineering drawings enables the students to learn the techniques and standard practice of technical drawing
so, in this case peak is once again if peak is a then rms will be how much
now this transistor should be biased properly biased correctly, right
number 6 is sadness; now, sadness is the hardest to micro expression to fake
so, that can be compensated for only by having differential compounding and not cumulative compounding
and therefore, s is equal to 1 minus n upon ns say this is equation 5
that you are this i0 actually not exactly in phase in phase with i write because it has some core loss that is iron loss that is eddy current and hysteresis loss
that means, the potential will be whatever is the voltage of the downward leader that is that coming from the cloud through the conductor; it will raise to that potential
once this division is done, we have to measure distance a to 1, let us name them as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on
in this case t1 through these gears is transferred to the second gear that is having torque t2
it is also associated with the rhetorical repertoire of aesthetics identity and uniqueness
and what are those quantities
so, that is why op is equal to x and the portion op is in equilibrium under the action of t, h and wx
during the time on q1 is on, this point is at v in q1 has to withstand v in during the time on q1 is on this point is at v in and this point is at ground and therefore q2 should handle v in so when you rate the device they have to be rated for maximum at least v in it should be greater than v in
financing is plus 9,000
so, let us look at each of these in turn and what we can do with them
so there is no point on talking about in what way it is better than induction generator because induction generator is hardly ever used they are not used very commonly
because if for example, in this coordinate axis if my delta function is over here and my observer is over here at theta and r then; obviously, the way this source is emitting there is a theta dependence for this guy over here
one quick thing i want to point out that this k prime which i have written as k r minus j k i both k r and k i will turn out to be positive numbers ok
but sorry, but this entire space outside and inside of this metal layer is covered with a material having a dielectric constant epsilon effective
you talk about the steel, you talk about even you talk about the services sector the telephone industry, communication industry talk about there was one department dot department of telecommunication right and later on it became bsnl also
we have first understood what is a final output in the form of balance sheet, then p&l, then cash flow flow and now we are going to understand what is a recording part of it
i would like to get some feedbacks from your side what more can be done with the application or any feature you want it to add more than what it has
therefore, it the return to libc attack would not work
this is like the j term you have a question no yeah
for all this what we require is a way of capturing these errors within the program as it is running without killing the program
as i said this is expected to occur when the level of pre compression is low
so, this is canceled, so, i am just left with this all right
now, in this case we were looking at max heaps; we can also do a dual construction where we change the heap condition to say that each element must be smaller than its children, in which case we have what is called a min heap and then instead of delete max, the operation we perform is delete min
this is i am giving you a small exercise that why i am writing v 1 difference or v 2 the difference operator
now that we have identified where the address of system is present and also, we have found a string in the executable which contains slash bin slash bash and we found the address of that particular string, we are ready to build our exploit
so, these are basically clock interrupts
in the case of a semi conductor these electrons and holes are set to drift through the material
and we will have holes in the valence band
now, while usually we will expect a function to take one or more parameters, it is possible that you write a function which does not take any parameter
in which case you may require a plus 5 volts for some of the ic’s within your computer, you may require 3
how we will express that
our text book is engineering drawing by nd bhatt, and panchal, and others
so let us say that we have an instruction like this where we want to move the address of a variable to this register edx
now in this particular case you can calculate it and it is very easy to see that it is simply equal to r1 parallel r2
so, for this particular same way if you see this one right, it goes to many more complex layers
so in this case we have seen earlier that the permissible shear stress in the code is
so, we will see that for the static and friend function the meaning of inheritance would be quite different
if we are drawing an ellipse, it goes via this points, once we know v prime and v we can make intersection point so that a perpendicular bisector meets at o
so, that is why port 3 and 4 are isolated and port 1 and 2 are isolated and the remaining are either through or coupled
it will not because something different will happen at the moment when it reaches the level v cc by 3
the second constraint will put a lower bound on the frame size, which is that the execution time of each task must be accommodated in one frame
that’s what we are going to look at in this particular section
need not be orthogonal, i can have non orthogonal basis also
aa band stop response is between f l and your f h right
it has double type, but it does not have a complex type
eta value is going to be significantly small in comparison to the length of the wall
among the service mix people is the most important element as specialized knowledge is basic and most important requirement for superior treatment of the patients
therefore, the rms value is always greater than this rms value is always greater than average value for a your average value except for a rectangular wave
so, minus 16 volt the polarity will be reverse
so let us try to look at the utility of it, okay
so, generating information one, getting actual information two and then comparing actual with the budget and then say taking appropriate decision at the top level of the firm is the ultimate purpose of this budget and budgetary control and facilitating the management decision making
so, the question is that t these 2 functions t a 2 and t b 2 they have a different sign on the edge it will not matter
and it is 2 sin a sin b that is cos a minus b minus cos a plus b put that use that formula
now, if you; that means, this function actually this function, this gate function actually is equal to sum of 2 unit steps a function that is this is one plus symbol is here, i made it plus right is equal is this one; that means, this one you can; that means, mathematically if you write like this; it will be 10 u t minus 3 minus 10 u t minus 6 because if this one plus this one
and there will be a point where this sale will saturate and beyond that point again this sale will start dropping down
and initially i set the duty cycle to the maximum 1
this is the object we will like to represent it on the drawing sheet
so if we look at it one more time in terms of a plot if you remember from my last time we had plots for plotting the 5 why analysis
now, if i actually try to come to 0 and go towards minus 10 ampere, right
so there will be definitely different in terms of the induced emf quantity in each of these turns
measured this, measure this value, measured t 2; t 2 is to be measured ok so, basically we have to measure this time right
then you need to go back to the drawing board and say, hey, you know what
name is as if you are saying that the star p is an integer
so, imagine there is waveguide i want to send wave through very simple we know analytically in these cases we can even analytically calculate what the fields look like, but that is not our objective let us see what this simulation does
so, constructive interference
looking at it what can you say
now, zoom into this portion, add lines, perhaps we would like to have a very vertical line from there to there, done
if you don't recall this, go back to basic electrical circuits and then find out about this theorem
so, the inverting; this is plus v in is positive here this is non this is non inverting this is inverting; that means, at 2 minus 1 is 1
now, what happens in this case of 16 pf we you get the items, you respond to them and then you are assessed
so, we could have managed the show with still much lesser cost of material but usage of the material somehow went up
a one major point to note here that plus is a binary operator, so it needs two operands
and also we have interrupt latency requirements
a list can be transformed in place we can take a list and change its structure unlike a string if we try to change a string we have to actually construct a new string and re assign the name, but in a list with the same name we can update parts of it without affecting the other parts
so that way, ng sim helps you do that one
the voltage here is vn and the voltage that appears across on this side is n times vin because of the terms ratio 1 is to n
there are three fundamental things all of which we have see informally in the gcd case
if you need to be an applicant, you need to demonstrate by what proof you are claiming the status of an applicant
so, under no load condition we take it that the series parameters hardly ever play a role in the voltage drop as well as in the power loss
078 kg per meter that we have calculated, l is given 150 meter and t just we have computed 6450 kg
the places where the function goes to 0, right
that is, if you have multiple parameters in a constructor you could put the initial values of these parameters in terms of a pair of in the list notation and use an initialization symbol after the object name
so in which case i can say if i am looking at the magnetic field direction like this
whatever data communication you want you can see it in this port
and similarly, when i say that the output of this gate is going from one to zero, which means the capacitor was already in the charge state is one high, it is discharging through this path
so, if you actually examine the test setup, the compression load is actually acting along this line
for example if you have air entrained systems which have a lot of voids but these voids need not be essentially connected in the same way as we expected for a high water to cement ratio concrete
so, if i go on the next slide, then you have an example to solve
a mooc again is not merely a collection of lecture videos uploaded on a platform
when you talk about dry oxidation, you have silicon, a wafer at very high temperature about 1200 degree centigrade, loaded into a thermal furnace
so now if we know what is the change in the voltage, that we can understand using oscilloscope, right
during this time primary inputs are dont care, and p, o and scanout we dont know, or this can be empty
so, if this is the case then how much will be the error
the poisson's[u14] equation is: is del square, v e equals minus rho over epsilon zero
so, this is the area a is equal to l into b right
if one is using a3 sheet, then the drawing board required is d3 size
and his answer was customer visits are few, are fewer than they used to be
we say that a scheduler s1 is more proficient than s2
i would prefer to roland barthes who has commented that food is a situation and it is closely related with our culture
because maybe the next day i did not make these terminals as tight as it was on the first day
wiki for notes
so i can anticipate, by again same form of the equation, that a will also be in the phi direction
at the same time we find that eyes communicate is certain sense of trustworthiness
so, we do not have f with us anymore
this is the problem involve in words
if the pendulum is trying to move from right to left, then the friction is always from left to right
and we will see how we can use those properties in our circuit analysis
so, it went down; now, click ok
now, i am not interested about this point
and here she is today to share her experience on e learning from industry perspective
or there is another condition: there is an event in l, s means s becomes one, which means a one get selected
now, what we want to do is rotate this entire object in this direction
now if a surge having a maximum value of 100 kv, travels along the overhead line towards its junction with the cable calculate, a
so, if my vo equals to ad into v1 minus v2; then ad is gain with which the differential amplifier, amplifies the difference between two input signals and it is also called as the differential gain
now moving on a c supports another kind of collection container, which is pretty much like structures, they are called union
first of all we will draw the top and front views of one of the ends because it is a line there will be two ends like a point and b point and one of the ends we will draw it
so, it is the same principle seen from two different waves; the first wave is the physics based wave the second wave is a more math based wave ok
so, torque is a constant and back emf in the first case e b 1 will be v minus i a 1 r a
and then you have to find out the measured packing density of each of the aggregate classes
the stepped failure continues but then by the time it then by the time it reaches 90 degrees for uniaxial tension you have a flat line, you have the bed joint failing
if i take this direction to b, the z direction in which the current is going, b is nothing but mu naught over 2 pi s
but what this course enables you too is to understand some basic accounting and financial concepts
the top simply returns the element from the top position; push increments the top position and puts the new element which is been given to be added to the stack on to the stack and pop simply decrements the top point at or the top index
what does the combination of values in the data members decide the combination of values in the data member we have seen in the last module decide the state of the object
and i have my original circuit with a 200 microampure current source
let an electromagnetic field exist around it so that we have e field and b field in this region
now this open circuit voltage across the terminal a b in the circuit on the left must be equal to voltage source vth in the circuit on the right
so, after these 4 steps are done the enclave is ready to use and then the application could actually use various instruction eenter and eexit to enter and leave the enclave
so, ujt is a non linear amplifier it is a low cost and used in free running oscillators synchronized or trigger oscillators and pulse generation circuits at low to moderate frequencies this application now you see here it is nothing, but it looks like a pn diode right and then there is a resistor due to the b 2 here and then the resistor due to b 1 which is here, right
so, april sales we had made and out of those april sales what were the total means why this information now it must be clear to you why this april information is given to us
so, all we need to do to compute the factors of m is to test every number is range one to m and if it divides m without a reminder, then we add it to list of factors
now if you look at the methods used in psychology, the tools that are used in psychology would realize that most of the researchers heavily depend on questionnaires
so, this is equation 5 right but for easy remembering i r into r plus i x into x l right; where i r is equal to i cos theta and i x is equal to i sin theta right
so, if you plot n versus 1 over t, we are going to get a straight line with the slope that was given by the ionization energy
so how to measure the effort
another strategy is to intersperse small activities between the chunk where the logical pause point is
and from here we see that we can also, we have a path along this constant conductance circle where g equal to 1 to the origin
how we represent, we represent in the asterisk form, so what we say that yt is equal to xt, this is not a multiplication, this is asterisk and ht
if there is a combination of two or more kinesics signals it becomes a sentence
but the aluminum gallium arsenide layer helps in passivating the surface bonds or the surface defects states, it also has a higher band gap then gallium arsenide so that it allows the radiation to pass through it and be absorbed by the gallium arsenide, this intern leads to a higher efficiency
so, the payload that we will actually consider is to create a shell
now, in the end if you look there is a table which is showing the type of the asset and estimated useful life
so, whenever, i am actually running it freely or free running test i am going to have s equal to 0 because of which it is as good as rotor is open circuited because r2 by s becomes infinity, right at s equal to 0
so, why that there was a gap between the standard and the actual time and that gap is not a small gap
and, this gap is tau sampling period a period 1 over tau is the sampling frequency
so, in this particular case, let us see how the circuit will work, let us see how the circuit will work, right
so, i am writing this again so that you get used to this convention that we have and this of course, is global ok
actually the answer is you do to need to record more because in cost accounting you are recording with lot of more details
another path exists between a1 and b1 like this
and if you have a bad placement, obviously i have mention it earlier you may not be able to complete the routing
because, there are 3 major reasons of that, first, the electric power which we get in our houses or in our industrial establishments are mainly the 3 phase power
i can continue that idea here and say nodes right nodes are the node values are unknowns and we will see in the next slide how to construct the shape functions
so i 0 you have got 6 ampere so, v 0 will be 4 into 6
and the fact that the excitation current must be drawn from the main that is the stator side right
so, this is 200 into 2
i will give an example at the end of this particular course like i said, technically
so, basically i 1 i writing here for you
so the virtual address space as we have seen in the previous lectures comprises of two components, so it comprises of a user space where your typical code stack heap and other data segments are present and above a particular memory location you have the kernel space
now, on this normal to surface we draw a hexagon, a hexagon 6 sides we will construct it
so here we will apply match analysis again and try to find out the current value i0 in first case that is when vs is equal to 12 volt
so, if i am taking a cone, so, usually in drawing practice, anything behind the object which is not straightforwardly visible, we show it by dashed lines
okay so this is a basic note taking application we have developed as a part of our solution in design thinking
but this is not exactly concerned with our discussions
the other method is called glass box method
the first approach is refer to as a grid structure
of this three halves, one, h, comes from b applied and one half of h comes from the m which has been induced
so, now, z star if, that means, what you can do is that, you should not be confused with this what you can do is this all are same
so, when i etch my metal what structure will i have, i will have structure which will look like this, right this is metal, this is pr photoresist, this is my sio2
so, no code memory is in general rom
when i take the time, average sin square k dot r of minus omega t is going to give me a factor of two, one half and therefore this becomes one half e zero square over mu zero, and c is nothing but square root of epsilon zero, mu zero one over
with the time the location of that point moving from one location to another location along the curve or perhaps you are defining something like it has to go along particular surface like a curved surface, maybe it might be rolling on a sphere, it might be rolling on an ellipsoid and so on
this is a very important consideration
so, let us connect another probe to this oscilloscope
here we want to know whether company has enough current assets to pay for its current liabilities
i hope you remember that while discussing depreciation, we had discussed some concept and that concept has direct bearing on the valuation of inventory
so, then what we can do is, we can write i square is equal to i square is equal to i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square divided by n right or i is equal to square root of i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square sum it up, divided by your n, right
you see both dot i mean this kind of thing here it is minus here it is minus right here current leave the terminal reference dot is this one it is coming flux right
so, kw1 is winding factor i am not discussing this here just you keep it in your mind, because more you will study in your electrical engineering in your third year induction machine
similarly marginal costing, marginal costing is a part of is a technique of the cost accounting not of the management accounting
so, if i were pressing amplitude, i will know see the top signal at the amplitude, all right one line our cursor is at the top of the waveform
w will be the final operating point after all the acceleration is done with different values of resistances
it doesn't tell about that
this is my computational domain
in this demo will be actually looking at an example of how position independent code works
similarly, for the three phase case, r dash will be rho l upon pi r dash square right
because, there again you are going to come back and your graphics team is going to get annoyed with it
so, you have to look at the data sheet
because [calculate/calculating] calculating a potential is suppose to make calculation of the field easier, as we saw in the case of electric field
we will look at how applications would use the intel sgx feature and we create enclaves
so, let me move everything else on to the other side
so this particular lag will be completely short circuited then and that case the zn will be left with only 5 ohm resistance
then we have amplifier we output voltage this output voltage is feedback to the feedback network and that goes back to the input signal right easy, very easy right, super easy
then on both sides, because this is a symmetric objects on both sides it naturally adjusts to that
standard cell
and this similarity is because of this the lostless and reciprocal nature of this circuit and due to the relationship that we had give it a condition for 2 port network just we that had derived earlier a few slides early you can verify them that this modulus of this will be same as the modulus of s 2
so, now v y will discharge
we will see what these specific terms mean as we proceed in this lecture
so h in both cases is one over four pi three m dot r r minus m over r cubed, as just derived because of the analogy of the equations
xn is known
if you can for a moment go back to our slides, monitor slides what you see is for theta these are the chevsif polynomials once again, for theta between minus one and plus one the value of the chebyshev polynomials represented by this gamma is also confined to this range, that is minus one, plus one
long term provisions is a small amount
so, it absorbed power
30 weeks, not hours, 30 weeks are given
input resistance to vi2, when vi1 equals to minus vi2 will be equal to
so, now, let us imagine that you know where you know in the business of calculating radar cross sections for aircraft ships and so on ok
because monthly requirement is 4725000 and c has been worked out as 113000
so when you say it is streaming stream oriented, it is sort of angering with constrained devices, ah, where you have low memory, right, you have low memory
this is very important to understand in finite voltage gain ok
because again what is well known is that very few people actually go ahead and in fact, participate in the forum unless there is something a little extra
the sentences they use a rather short encrypt and they are always in a hurry to reject the proposals because often they tend to overlook the details
so, please draw phasor showing v showing vi v1 v2 and v3 everything right
let us see that step by step
now, we do not worry about it because that is another part where you can understand and learn how to design the circuit
so these are some ways of modeling this interconnection wire
see the voltage
this is how we just estimate f sw
if we have a asset, it's value it's a value, there is no reliable estimation available, then also we cannot value it and show it in the balance sheet
now if you if you take the current rating for the vjt you will see that the average of the inductor current will be i in and i in and i not are related if you use the abs second balance you will see that i in i in into d is i not or i in will be i not by d and therefore you know the average value for the bjt here
for even more simple, you can remember that cash and cl these two of each other's pair they will go together whereas cash and ca are competing they would go opposite just cl yeahad rake whose opposite moment is for current assets okay now after adjusting debtors and creditors we get cash generated from operations but before tax
if you remember, there are mainly 2 kinds of devices, those in which you have an injection of carriers that recombine in order to give you light
there is an option to rotate when you rotate it this triad also rotates
the other thing that we said is that it satisfied in this particular case, what kind of boundary conditions that we have
so this is the 400 into standard rate minus actual rate
so this we finish our today's class and next class we will discuss about the one of the most important term called rms values because whenever you analyze the electrical circuit, you will always get the vm and im as represented in terms of rms value
and for motor drive, i have connected to d3, and d4 is the input that is coming from the output of the opto coupler
so, two important examples are there
we are specialize from here, we go to the manager we has specialization of engineer we add new data members so that managers can actually keep the recording reporting information
so we can model this as a signal flow graph where we use two dummy notes in the input side and the output side, and every, you can say every signal line or every gate can be represented by a verdicts
the operation of the flyback converter and the waveforms will be exactly like that of the buck boost converter except that we have put this extra turns here
so, one task may be waiting for long time and it's about to miss its deadline, then the scheduler will increase its priority so that it will be able to meet its deadline
it is a system that will detect smoke, whether it is present inside a particular room or a particular area
so, it a return values could be lost could be ignored and so that this is not a very effective mechanism for doing this
str to the name
now this domain over here i am going to i want to determine to a very high resolution right
now, he talked about now penis envy and castration anxiety
similarly, from equation your this from equation 69, right
so ideally when you talk about cpc coating you should get something from here to here but because if you do not apply proper cleaning and proper surface preparation you will have something this which is not really useful thing to do and when you talk about the amount of money invested, so what do you see like there is no significant increase in the chloride threshold
so, what you can do is maybe give them relevant examples like when i refer to a scenarios you can give an example where they are possibly going to use this
so, as an acceleration is applied, a force is developed
and i writing the virtual keyword in front of it may be a good practice, because anybody else can quickly understand that, but it is not mandatory
so let us try to take a look at exactly how this looks when we are having the phasor diagram completely drawn
it has got its limitations
now, what i have to do, give a left click on one of the point
so the cost of goods sold will be, goods to be sold will be 12,500 worth of the dollars
this is similar to the electrostatic energy which was given as one half epsilon zero e square
you see, this data sheet that you see here, ah, now lets see if it is own enough
now although the mutual inductance m is always a positive quantity the voltage that is mutual voltage represented as m di by dt may be negative or positive
now how do i connect it to this
similarly, v 2a can be written as z 21a i 1a z 22a i 2a, so you can see from this particular figure this would be the z parameter equations of this network will be the equation which we just saw
late realization of this dilemma whether to publish or to patent could lead to disastrous consequences
6 ohm is not effective nothing will go through this
38 angle 22
as far as ancient building systems are concerned, we examined this concept of the thrust line
so, i hope by now that you have actually install the virtual box and you actually have this ubuntu running as shown over here
now as the name suggests in horizontal analysis we compare
now, what next you have to do, you have to just equate the coefficients of like powers of s
no, because these are of lower priority tasks and high priority tasks don't cause inversion to lower priority task
and when we now come to something which is not a definition then python will try to execute it, this in turn could involve invoking a function in which case the statements which define the function will be executed and so on
but the case that i shall be talking about now is, lets say we have two inverters that are connected in cascade may be we are designing some kind of a buffer
if you look at the total mobility, it will be dominated by whichever scattering process has the lower value
now, apart from the inventive step which would be critical in drafting the claim, you will also get information on description and background of the invention
so, we will be starting with the total amount of the sales and when you see the sales, particulars means the sales and it is divided into two parts
so, this will be required for sometimes for solving numericals therefore, rotor resistance by stand still rotor reactor and t maximum torque if you put in that expression, you will get 3 upon omega s into 0
one another thing that we learnt from this was actually that the corrosion rate was being diminished in zone 1 which was the lower corroding one
the studies of regulators focus on the facial expressions, etcetera in the listener
that means, if i if i have a pad here and if i connect this line here andt if i measure the impedance i have infinite impedance
so, each pin of the i o port; so, it is internally connected to the cpu bus
unlike the waterfall model where the test activities occurred only when only in the integration and system testing here this slide it just says what are the system the test activities occur during the requirement analysis and specification system test case design activities occur high level design the integration test design activities occur and during the detailed design the unit test design activities occur the strength of this model is that it emphasizes verification and validation
we just said that the scheduler examines the task having the earliest deadline and then schedules it
in new zealand it is still practiced in ceremonial fashion
as you see here each of the corrected and effective learning outcome is stated from learner perspective using action words which are measurable
initially, we are checking for the variable “val”
so, which all terms will appear in u prime or you can look at this form look at this form of u of x now you have to evaluate u prime of x
so, this is my interrupt service routine in the in the in the interrupt service routine what i will do
later on if you get larger amounts then the quantification becomes more accurate
so if you see in this figure, these currents i1 and i2 are called as mesh currents
now, using our compass from a; what we have to do is; pick a radius, pick a radius greater than half of ab
and when you are retracing from seven, you are looking for a cell which is one less six
so, mu where mu r is the relative permeability and is defined as mu r is equal to flux density in the material divided by flux density in a vacuum right
so, this 180 degree if i introduce a phase shift of 180 degrees in my beta, if i introduce a phase shift of 180 degree in my feedback network, then 180 degree plus 180 degree, there will be my 360 degree 360 degree is equal to 0 degree correct, 0 and 360 degree are same
now let's say the nonlinear element is in some operating point condition
so we are saying number of possible input combinations: two to the power m possible signature, two to the power n
therefore, i 1 we get minus 6 ampere if we will get i 1 is equal to minus 6 ampere means the current actually in this branch flowing in other direction
35 μm, so the same 350 nm the percentage absorbed using the same formula is only 16
28 or 0
now, in case of high strength friction grip bolt the friction will be coming into picture for calculating the design strength of the bolt
but i can still define a pointer to this type; i can define a reference to this type
yeah, in class i always do
so let's examine the first criterion, the first mechanism, the in plane flexual mechanism and here we are really considering a wall that has boundary conditions at the top and the bottom
now as we know what malloc would do is that it would look into the link list and it would pick one of the chunks which is available, so in this case it would actually pick the first chunk which is a and thus what you would see and what is expected is that a as well as c would point to the same memory chunk, so both of them would have the same value stored in them
so, for instance this is very common in construction projects in infrastructure projects where they want to specify the quality of concrete to be used on marine zone or 1
these are getting shifted, one, one, one, one
it has relative positions of the pages in that enclave security flag associated and so on
all the way from 3 goes intersect there
some time that arcing thing, it may sustained at that time you have to; for 50 hertz or 60 line voltage
what does high pass filter means
and that's what we did it
and to sense the difference at the drain, this is i d and this is i 0, the difference at the drain, this is id and this is i 0, the difference current, id minus i 0 flows through the capacitor
so, this is the adxl 335 accelerometer, and i will be doing the connection with stm kit
now we said that in space the variables was staggered by half a grid right, staggered by
now, the observer looks from there
these two conditions there is a name for them they are called null boundary conditions
of course, here i am assuming that i am starting with some kind of a random placement, not placing them one by one
what if i calculated the, calculate l through the flux formula, that is, i calculated total flux divided by i
if, on the other hand, we want to compare the strings by length, then, the same argument would give us plus 1, because, aab has length 3 and is longer than ab
curl i know by stokes theorem is going to convert to a line integral
so, these are the different stacks states all that we can keep on doing is we take; scan the expression from left to right, take a free operands, put it into the stack, keep on stacking till we come across an operator
one way of bypassing aslr is if the attacker determines either by brute force or by special attacks known as timing attacks, where the attacker finds out where in the entire virtual address space of the process is the library actually loaded
so, we are just check this once again if this is what we will get yeah
it is a statement which shows normal incomes and expenses
now i am going to pass a current here, so let us say i am going to pass a current here from i because of which some movement is taking place but still the spring is holding it pretty tightly
so, this is the explanation of why this plate is moving when we move this magnet ok
so, we started with the general solution over here and we said physically that a is equal to 0 is the only meaningful thing and that gives me this
so what we are saying is that in anyone of the edges you add a vertex and we add a dummy edge here, so this is no longer a complex triangle
probably verifying his notes with all, cross checking his notes from that particular class
and every line computation we needed one additional and and one additional or operation during the simulation processing
so one simple way to do that, suppose you know we have letõs say a particular frequency f 1 gain like this, so this is my gain, this is frequency
so, after this you have to solve for your what you call i 1 and i 2
it's only with nonlinear devices that you need power amplification
still compared to other industries, it's a ratio on a lower side
so, that company was manufacturing two different products at that time
if you may recall, in dynamic breaking or rheostatic breaking what we did was to connect a resistance, we had connected a resistance the field was still there but what we did was this eb was circulating a current ia which was actually getting dissipated, the current was dissipating the power in form of heat in rb
for example, here we have this vertical plane and this is the horizontal plane and our cylinder perhaps resting in that way
now, if i try to solve this problem in the most general 3d way it is going to be a little bit complicated
you see there is a small hole in between and the wheel is actually placed in between those two plates here
but with the other metals you have to extract it from its ore
capacitor will be represented as 1 by s
so, from here and this is the point so, a free hand sketch
so, the flexual failure mechanism, when the formulation is made, the formulation is based on a flexual compression failure occurring at the compressed toe
so this would be a situation where you have already mentioned
our sales are say 10,000 units up to the point we start planning for the next period
we continue with our discussion on sensors and actuators
so, these are glycol protein
and here we have another very important, you can say, empirical rule or law that has driven us over decades
and similarly for t also, you can write the names of the terminals like 1, 2, 3, 4
it is a measure of work that is being done
and more know rhyming you make it the better you would succeed
so, we will have a pattern like this, like a loop ok
so, it is circumference is 2 pi r that is actually length l is equal to 2 pi r
so, if the wall thickness which is the thickness of the masonry panel is tm and the elastic model is of the masonry can be estimated as e
so the required arrival time is less than the actual arrival time
so, what was what was the very start of this course we have talked about huygens principle
and researchers who worked on the subject have proposed empirical expressions that take care rather well the effect of the geometry on the state of shear stress causing failure itself
and if you apply your same way if you apply your kvl, so you will get it your i e b is equal to v minus i a into r plus r a
typically, the minimum value is 20 nanometer and the maximum value is 200 nanometer
i think that is a common share of emotions which the whole humanity has
so, there first we should understand what depression is for the benefit of the audience and people who are attending in this course can actually teach other people also that is how awareness grows
so we will see how we can derive the rms value with the help of the peak values and sinusoidal termed
so the main issue was difficult to control and observe the internal flop flops
so, what is required is in this context we need to make a suitable extensible design, design so that we can as a required add new employee types and new processing logic for the processing of salary without making significant changes to the existing code or if possible not making any change at all in the application that finally process the salary, this is the basic target
similarly, click the left side face
so, we can refine it a bit and say it, call it as credit sales upon average debtors
one thing we have not look much is how we actually do the doping
what are the different kinds of parameters that you define with respect to a clock
so, earlier what you have seen, we can either increase the size of a gate, we can reduce the delay of a line, possibly by inserting buffers
if i try to instantiate the object then i will get an error, because certainly if object cannot be instantiated unless i know the constructor, destructor, other operators and members and so on
as the first example, let us take the case where i take a sample of magnetic material, paramagnetic or diamagnetic, and put it in a uniform field b
it does not matter, whatever you need, you can put there
we have seen how on a hierarchy of classes, we can have virtual functions and how virtual functions dynamically bind to the object instance instead of binding to the pointer or reference to which a particular virtual function is being invoked
impedance is z is equal to r plus jxl and z is equal to here r plus jxl but at the receiving end say if shunt capacitor is connected current is i c and it is reactance is x c and this is the same phasor diagram as in the case of without anything right
three means you replace it by three vertices which are connected among themselves
so this says, take these three values, take three these names and assign them these three values
suppose, if we are asked to find out the value of i1 and i2, the circuit, the z parameters are given z11, z12, z21, z22, if you see in this case z12 is not equal to z21, so that means the circuit is not reciprocal
i replaced the current term by ohm’s law and i replaced by d by dt by j omega standard right
signal is applied to the non inverting terminal
so, this, but to make math simpler we had done this to avoid singularity
it is also known as e bit or pbit
0 plus j 3
okay, so normally we should write if it is a motoring mechanism d w e which is the electrical power input for a short duration, that should be equal to whatever is the increase in the field energy plus whatever is going to be increase in the mechanical energy plus of course losses
place queen we said takes the row i and the board and the first thing it does it has to determine
for some value of v d which is positive and what else can you see ok
in the memory locking feature the programmer can lock a memory page
and this is relevant cue that you are giving to yourself, because next time if you have to look at the photographs that you know, clicked in agra you will go for know, the folder which has the name agra
but basically you estimate the permissible stresses limited by a maximum value, fv, for your design where you are providing web shear reinforcement and require the web shear reinforcement to be resisting the shear forces coming onto the wall or without the web shear reinforcement
the third truth is that of “nirodha” or cessation; put an end to the suffering
so, it means what is now the variance
when we look from a purely transmission line point of view, the matching of circuits is similar to the matching using lumped elements but a little different principles are involved
so the bound charge on this cavities going to look like what i shown in the figure: on the inner surface is negative on the theta zero onwards and positive on the lower side
and then worry about the programming language
and this is the problem and this is why you need a certain amount of expertise to apply the technique because if you let all these variables vary at will, then you can end up with any old rubbish
and remember that the remainder is always less than n so we do not have to worry about flipping it and taking max and min at this point
and once you have done that, we can do the design of the inductor in a very simple way
by using the equation that divergence of e is equal to rho over epsilon zero, we can write this equation as epsilon zero, mu zero d by d t of divergence of e, with a minus sign plus divergence of v
now this particular approach let us try to understand with the help of one example
so, thus when the fork system calls return, we have the child process which is exactly duplicate of the parent process
so, they in fact, this endpoints will cancel except at the very endpoints of the
we assume that the execution time is cs or es, okay, the notation used here is cs, required every ps time
now, the value of resistance r can change from zero to infinity
the same thing holds good in this particular case as well
so eb i can calculate
in the last module we have seen the applications of operation amplifier
now, if you see what are the advantage of active filters, why we have to use active filters, why we have to use active filters, why we cannot generate the circuits using passive filters
now, if the list classes are delete function it will also need to be friend of node and so on
do you proceed as
so, it is one and here speed is 0 this side need not bother and this side breaking mode and this side is generating mode a little bit explanation only will be given and that is all right
it will stop amplifying and start oscillating here
this is a block i have placed
74
it has an amplifier inside
so, to keep things very concrete what i am going to do is i am going to assume 3 segments just 3 segments and we will build our system of equations for 3 segments
so, there and this so starting from 0; i have a potential drop
so we have 2 versions of this rdtsc function other one is for 32 bit and the other is for 64 bit and if you are using trying to actually replicated this particular covert channel on your own machine, you could suitably enable one of these 2 functions
and h22 you will get as i2 upon v2
some of them included bursting crackers beneath their seats
smiles are controlled by two sets of muscles, zygomaticus major muscles which round down with side of face and connect to the corners of a mouth and the orbicularis oculi which pulls the eyes back
and you will get again it is half v m i m cos theta is equal to v i cos theta
so, which way is it going to go
usually, it ends, we show it something like a mark x x; that means it is a kind of plane which we are going to slice it, cut the section and show that view
so this is my expression
d for d or data flip flop and that is why i actually call this input as d ok
this is what is meant by change of control flow, and such instructions are termed as control flow instructions
actually, you should have substantially reduced because they are repaying their loans compared to earlier years
so, we know how the mosfet looks like right
the old phone might not be still unusable, but newer phone might give much better utilities that is why with better availability of either hardware or software one tends to replace the assets faster that is mainly because of obsolescence if you as a as observe carefully many of the apps either on our mobile or on computer, they need to be deleted or updated continuously because the older versions are no longer the best versions and the newer versions are available
so we will use them for a given sinusoid that is vt is equal to vm cos omega t plus 5 and convert them into phaser form
so once this is checked, that means the uhh assume number of bolts are okay, assume diameter of bolts are okay
we will take the example of phenylketonuria little later
and it should be visual, so that it does not require a lot of language to express what it is, is something that is the need of the hour
with this let us see a formal definition of what a friend function is, “a friend function of a class has access to the private and protected members of the class
and as we know the characteristics can be divided into 2 minimum regions, the triode or the linear region and the saturation region
that does not sound right, maybe i have to do something to test whether they like it
this is lv, and le is the distance between prying force and bolt center line, le, distance of the prying force to bolt center line
so, 2 i x plus v 0 by 4, but i x is equal to minus v 0 by 2 see, if you put i x is here minus v 0 by 2 minus v 0 by 2, then you will get the value of v 0, you can solve for v 0 that, what we have done next right
so the wrong
and you will get glitches, you will get (refer time: 06:59)
so, now we as we have said we can connect this in two different ways; one with a common ground, another without a common ground
so, because of this relationship we will say c is completely independent y
if we were not going to be providing web shear reinforcement, we would still be okay
that is proof
so, it means that, if we have a function like e to the power minus a t into f t, the laplace transform of that would be f into f of s plus a
when that now there write up is there is just when the whatever i said when the transformer is loaded a current i 2 will flow in the secondary winding
so, we have a set of quantum numbers n 1, n 2 and n 3 and they are used to define the energy of the electron
so, the steps that we need to do to develop the schedule, the first thing to do is to choose the frame size and then we may not be always successful in the first attempt to get acceptable frame size
but i think we sort of got there now
as we see the rheology is very important, how can we come up with the new chemical admixtures that can control the workability of the csa based cement
the third parameter is little tricky, and right now you may not understand why the third parameter is required
so, you can just plug in the numbers and the answer is 0
we can change it later
so, we need to find the ionization energy for the extra electron in the silicon lattice this extra electron is coming from the pentavalent impurity
however, notice that i have already accounted for q one, q three in this term and q two, q three in the second term and therefore i have j equals four through n over r three, j and so on
so, now, let us now this is the second order homogenous differential equation that we want to solve ok
books and internet
free body diagram means you just take the main body of the element and show the forces applied on that particular body or mass
here you will see that, it allows the frequency from this onwards, the pass band is here and it does not allow the frequency below this particular range
for example looking at this particular plot we can actually infer the sets which had incurred a high execution time
and direction of the flux you will get the magnetic circuit the right hand rule i told you in the direction of the current you graph the your what you call coil and your thumb will put the your what you call the direction of the flux right
the main idea is that these functions are not you cannot write them in closed form ok, but that does not mean we cannot numerically see what it looks like
pick the object place it in the natural position
so, this is actually self inductance for this kind of coil
so, total amount which we are returning back to the bank as a total effect of financing we have shown or the returning the loan we have shown is the 15,758
so, note that the eax register contains the pointer to the correct address of mylib int
and for the dynamic net weighting they are modified and changed dynamically during placement iterations
and we can diffuse the dopant in the window created and thus we have the source and drain
so this is the basic idea behind the yoshimura kuh algorithm that analyze this zones
then the input offset current
now it goes to our unconscious state and because if you make a mix of the infantile state of memory the forgotten events and the subliminal experiences then this combination makes us too much varied from each other
we are not talking about c++ string right now, which you already know has a comparison operator
so, this is the way isometric view really looks like
if we are getting that, we call first angle projection technique
so, that is a typical style that we will often try to follow that, whenever we want to set some member, data member or may be at times get some data member even from within the member function of the class, we may want conceive whether we would directly set that or we will use some private member functions to set them
this simple experiment actually shows you how we can switch on and off a bulb or any circuit for certain duty cycle, and period in a pwm controlled fashion
so this is only conductor that is being used throughout the railway electrification zone, so this is the conductor or overhead conductor that we use and whatever is the rail here that is supposed to be our return conductor
in class 3 we are understanding the process to fabricate an integrated circuit
so, e f i is e v plus e g over 2 minus 1 half kt ln of n c over n v
now there are many different kinds of things that can go wrong
so let see for this example what will happen for this case
a 34 meter high wall would be how many stories
this mu zero cancels and you end up getting rho i square over two pi square a cubed and the direction of the pointing vector is into the volume, as you can easily see by taking e cross b
so, i get lot of youngsters and kids are normally brought by parents and all that
and then we will do some kind of operation to find out whether there is smoke inside the room or not
this spherical element is given by r square time theta prime and d theta prime, d phi prime
now we are going to start actually on motors and generators
so, in today's class we have learned about full section details, half section, offset section and revolve sections
so, that p’ we will get and that projection supposed to be is 10 mm above it; that means, at 10 mm we have to mark a point somewhere here
and, each kid will undergo to the same process in different context
here r m is chosen to be r 1
this is how we can draw the equivalent circuit of the operational amplifier, this is how you can draw the equivalent circuit of ideal versus actual or real or practical op amp right, ideal or real or practical op amp easy, easy right
band reject band reject is two frequencies fl fh right
so, now what you will observe
whenever we have this kind of a thing where the same name is being updated, there is a short form where we can combine the operation with the assignment
the only sort of a thing to remember about this hertz dipole it was a very very small current element and because it is very small, you can assume current is approximately constant thing right
and this is your delta connected, it is your z c, z b, and z a
this will be the 5 units
so, it is good to understand
so since it is a second order equation you will get two roots of s
so, from this discussion, this is a, let me write it down, power divider
this is part a in part b, at what temperature is the donor 1 percent ionized and where is the fermi level located at this temperature
we will not get into that, but the main point is that there is no mention here about the intermediate names, it is just taking the parameters passed to the function and inductive or recursive calls and how to combine them
this says that we have to include mbed library mbed
and, this 1 degree will correspond to a high relative error say because say this position r x is r x is equal to 3 30 ohm is say here at 10 degree
so, the ipm cell also takes care of that, it has to be regularly filed, so that responsibility falls on the ipm cell as well
similar by similar way that reactance also can be transferred to that, so x 2 dash also will be k square into x 2, right
that means for a balanced system we generally know that the phases are equally upon equally distant with respect to each other that is 120 degree apart from each other
let us start our next module 3
so, intrinsic semiconductors or pure semiconductors are essentially single crystals; we say that there are no defects in the semiconductor, because these defects can again create electrons and holes of their own
if the speed increases originally i had k omega phi, phi has decreased now the speed will hit that value such that k phi omega comes back to its original condition
3 so, but here by you know while writing is it has been made 0
the beta; beta equals to 1 by 3 in case of wein bridge oscillator and my gain is 3 or if i write greater than equal to 3, then beta equals to 3 by 9; my gain would be greater than equal to 9
now, you are abstracted the idea for dot product from vectors to functions and you can talk about orthogonality right
so, if we see input signal 0 degree, 180 degree phase shift because inverting amplifier, so 180 degree part of output is feedback to the input
once it is done, already t point we know; so locate that point, intersect this already constructed circuit
now line to cable transmission factor that is refraction coefficient for voltage, we know that tau v 1 that it will it is actually 2 z 2 upon z 1 plus z 2 this we have seen earlier
so we are looking at a wall that is initially straight, subjected to eccentric loading and examine the deflections in the wall due to this eccentric loading and see if those deflections are actually going to compromise the force capacity, the strength capacity of the wall itself
all of this methods are extensively used all of them, and as discussed towards the end they have their advantages and they have their limitations
we will just have a look at the voltage waveforms too to understand what is happening to the voltage ratings of the converter
and therefore, food is a means of communication which among other things can also convey the status we want to communicate our attitude towards other people by the manner in which we order and we select our food items
so, both these machines are generally tough competitors in many cases because the efficiency is really, really better
so, its kinds of subsidizes the it is like the successful technology subsidizing the ones that do not become successful
let us look at some typical values for resistivity for all these three types
so you would see that b itself will be carrying dot current and cross current and so on and so forth
so, when you have dependent source available in the circuit which you cannot remove you will first remove all the independent sources and then apply voltage v naught and try to measure the current i naught and accordingly you can find out the value of thevenin resistance
so mostly of predict that this curve will be a straight line
so, it lost its significance at that time
ok, later on, if you move on the flip flopping, as i said, flip flops are typically activated by the edge of the clock, either the rising or the falling edge
and we really have to think differently about expectations around timing
and finally, i would advice that in module 18 when we started, we started with a motivation of building complete types, complete algebra for variety of different arithmetical types and others, so a complex number, fractions, string, vector matrices and so on
so, equilateral triangle every time we have to construct, assemble it in such a way that, it makes a closed object such kind of thing what we call as this octahedron
the primary reason for taking up these studies is based on this idea that our accessories symbolize our sense of self respect
we will see, b but that does not mean that voltage and current have linear relationship
so, over here on this part of the slide shows the assembly code for scan without canaries enabled
when we actually normally look at a machine or a system, we see that there are a multiple layer of hardware, there are vm’s, operating systems and above that the application
the schottky barrier height depends upon the difference between the work function of the metal and the electron affinity of the semiconductor
so what might happen is that in a point x the clock signal might be like this
but if you if you take operational amplifier which is a practical op amp, right
then we introduce a new type of value, which may not be so familiar for logical values true and false which are of type bool
the income statement which we prepared in the second second problem that was the profit and loss account and that was a part of the financial accounting
next let us talk about smoke sensing
so, i am going to assume the electric field at the start of the delta t remains the same for the delta t right
so, now suppose ah suppose you have this is your sending end and this is your receiving end right and your this is your what you call that shunt capacitor is connected q c; j i have not shown here every time, but understandable and this is the q load right
2 and into 50, but around that around that value it will be there right
after thirty minutes, you fill them with the plating medium the job is done and put it back into the co two incubator
so, after getting this when v is equal to 3 volt you solve the circuit, you will get i 0 is equal to 3 by 28 ampere right
so, immaterial or whatever feedback you get always learn something from that and try to improve right
in the ensuing video we look further at certain illustrations and associations of commonly found finger gestures
you have single leaf constructions, what we saw earlier in terms of the flemish bond and the english bond are single leaf constructions
what it can do basically it can measure the static acceleration due to gravity in tilt sensing applications as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock or vibration
because people have human mind as huge resilience, otherwise if you look at the society often you will wonder how do people live in such scholar, poverty with so many problems, but most people are living
now, depending on the scenario, depending on your priorities, the objective criteria may be different
otherwise even if the resource is unused still it will not be allowed access to the resource and we say that it undergoes avoidance related inversion
remember when you are doing print, you are actually printing a string
so, initially that your as this is open this is open
the first thing that i will be do is i will connect this led with stm board
if you come to modern constructions the whole concept of coarsed masonry and having a pattern is something that you would have definitely learned in your earlier classes in materials
so you if you want to change his mind set on the samsung to videocon you have to make numerous efforts, is it possible to make that much of the efforts and convince the customer number 1, second thing is this then only 30% will be available to you, second thing is that you have to keep the product and for example this product is 6 months old there is a risk of the option is also, product coming today from the company, product coming 6 months back from the company, you are keeping in your warehouse in your gudown
in the remaining part we would briefly discuss what is known as the state of an object
it is important for us to be able to understand c and c++ program binaries
but what's important is as far as this criterion is concerned we have to examine the shear strength coming from only the compressed zone of the wall which means part of the wall has already cracked and that may be tensile heel cracking right we are talking of mixed modes, it's not like right from the beginning you are going to have shear sliding occurring in the wall
and, the places where the larger portions we did not remove any material that portion will be left blank
so, we are using the estimate of the curvature at the cracked stage when the initiation of crack occurs, use that to proportion the curvature in the wall itself
this is again information that we will require for the life cycle assessment, electricity required, fuel consumption
but what about a 2 port microwave device
but i a lags i b by 120 degree, we know that, but i b lags 120 degree, simply substitute i b is equal to i a minus 120 degree, you put it here and you simplify, if you simplify you will get, i a is equal to v p upon root 3 divided by angle minus 30 degree by z y
so, just the length of the segment will come
lets take an example as follows: lets say we have an nand gate, we have an or gate and gate and another nor gate
though we find that those business houses and those work areas where the chinese and japanese people have to interact with the western culture, there is a closeness and proximity as far as the display of body linguistic norms are concerned
if you click on it, you will reach the page for the respective lxi which will also have the description of the focused question and instructions for posting the comments and instructions for peer discussion
so, similarly here also due to this i1 minus i 2 voltage will be induced here
we have to write the mesh equations for both of them so these would be the two mesh equations for these two meshes plus we will have another constraint for i x that is nothing but i 2 minus i 1
you will write complex number z is nothing but equal to x plus j
it is actually looking at the flux going below the rated value because of which the torque capability will also come down, if i am assuming that the armature current should not go beyond normal values
so now, let us take 1 example and let us what we discussed till now related to rc circuit
usually when i ask students to do this, they suggest putting rl between here and there and so on
so far we have had three kinds of visibility of which two we have already discussed public and private, we will soon discuss protected visibility which applies to inheritance
and if you now compare the two main functions you can see that all those exposed in it, exposed d in it kind of lines are different between the two main functions
this method we can use it only if tolerance accumulation is not going to affect the function of the part
s dot swap case will invert lower case to upper case and upper case to lower case and so on
now, let us take one example so that you can better understand let us see there is one differential equation that is d2y by dt2 plus 3 dy by dt plus 2y equal to r
that um your ah that ah system will generate your 10 y or this much power this mega ah power unit megawatt power less, right
now, in that, what all do i mean by good what does that term mean
and we finally, once we solve for it we use the huygens principle right
now, like for the constructor and destructor, we have free versions
so, i should put as many transmitters and receivers as is possible given size, weight and all of these things ok
so this is ia zs with a negative sign, this is going to be ia zs
that is going to be equal to the area times the pressure
32 into fbd is 118
so, here you substitute, it will be f m upon 2 pi r ampere turns per meter or we can write h is equal to f m upon l ampere turns per meter that l is equal to actually length of the mean flux path that is that circumference that is you 2 pi r
so, i have to go in this particular way this one this one and this one; i 1 equals to i 2 right i 2 plus i b 1, right applying virtual ground if i there is another concept called virtual ground we will see; we will have virtual ground means whatever the whatever my non inverting terminal if it is grounded my inverting terminal is also considered as the ground it is virtually ground now we will see about this concept right now v minus equals to v plus equals to 0 therefore, from k v l kirchhoff’s voltage law and ohms law we know that i 1 equals to nothing, but i 1 equals to v in minus v minus right divided by r 1 this is nothing, but v in by r 1 v now because here v minus you see the because of the co concept of virtual ground this terminal will be considered as ground, right
so these are the modes of failure and you can see from this classical picture of this concrete column which is standing in a sulphate rich soil that a lot of deterioration is seen at the interface between the soil and the air, okay
positive means it is added to expense
so, e minus e f is nothing but k t
0 per unit that is if it is 11 kv or 33 kv it will be 1 per unit means 11 or 33; that means, your q should be is equal to q c 0 that mean exact power will be injected
/dpic
hospital industry is related with social marketing
so we will just use this flexural test setup where we can break the motor prism into two and then we will spray the phenolphthalein indicator and then rainbow indicator on the freshly broken surfaces on the two different pieces and then we will measure the carbonation depth
this is the direction, so it's going to be going into this screen and is magnitude is going to be k, mu zero
so any design can be viewed from any one of the three angles
e is equal to e transmitted
actually, if you look at the amount, they have not increased much, but because of the fall in the revenue, they could not reduce their expenses like the fall in the revenue that's why as a percentage they have gone up so this is one way of interpreting it employee benefit as a percentage has slightly gone up depreciation as a percentage has slightly gone up so various figures now you can get it as a percent
in second case when suppose theta v minus theta i is the difference of angles is 90 degree that may be positive or negative
the inductance l and the voltage across the inductance vl and the current i which is flowing through the inductor are related by the faraday's law
as i said this is not, i mean, required you could easily define a range function which does the natural thing which is i, i plus 1 up to j, but then you have to keep remembering to put a minus 1 whenever you want the indices to stop with the correct place
and if you take the magnetizing m call magnetizing reactance right x m then you will see that i0 is purely i mean loss is neglected then this i0 and ∅ both are in phase and lagging from v1 / 90 degree
you can keep a track of your activities that you are doing throughout the day
what i am saying is that this path is dominating the value of slack mean
if this is the case, if you want to clean the chemical oxides from the native oxides we can have thickness of about 1 nanometer
so, 120 f by p, f is 60 so if i say that the closest synchronous speed is 1800 rpm then p has to be 4 poles
to know more about this first angle projection system or third angle projection system
i am writing the final form, just take care of every sign
so, everybody has is differential
during this particular movement of the mouth we find that corners of the mouth at turned upwards and this upward movement of the mouth is associated with emotions of happiness
not only that, we also specify some cost function, some objective function that is to optimize, and we give it to an ilp solver
that part of the code will be put in this void loop phase
pecking in many many birds is basically a species is specific behavior and when the babies they come out of the egg the mother bird is suppose to make them learn how to peck and this pecking has to take place within very very shorter period of time immediately after birth
it has to have certain magnitude, unless it has sufficient magnitude
so, i am denoting these real valued physical quantities by this slightly different symbol like a script e and script h
one answer is same direction
let a wave start propagating from the source till it hits one of the targets
so i shown you to examples where, by considering the equation of notion, we got an equation, which is the wave equation, from which you can determine the speed of sound, speed of the disturbance, speed of wave in that medium is going to be
so, if i call this voltage across the meter as v m, so, which is between these two points ok
so if you are using algorithm methods, so far as experience of some what code or experience of some tester, it cannot be easily quantified
so, at 0 kelvin, you have a valence band that is completely full and a conduction band that is completely empty at any temperature above 0 kelvin
now suppose this one of this lines i can move it to here from here, like this
we would be looking at the psychoanalytic frame work, where in we would talk about the proposition a freud, erikson, jung, adler and of course, karen horney
this fellow would have moved only ten fifteenth of that, one centimeter, and that means point six, seven centimeters
so we can write this: r square over four pi
so, there are ways and means of classifying the responses and based on these responses then the psychologist tries to identify the complexes and jung says that along with psychological complexes you can find out the intellectual and the emotional deficiency of the individual based on word association test
so, what should i get
so, this function append for instance modifies the value of the name fn to a new name which takes the old name and sticks an i at the end of it
you will appreciate the fact given these differences that exist between the different test methods that really there is no consensus in the scientific community on one single test that characterizes either the joint shear strength or the sheer strength of masonry
in the first case the functioning is explained as a text while in the second case it is explained along with an audio narration without a text
they usually do not show the tendency of making chunks of three or making chunks of four but gradually with a little more experience we all start doing that children start doing that but even though we might have grown up if you take adults who are not say chess players and compare with say chess master you would realize that chess masters have much better memory and they use span of memory like anything because they have to retain a series of moves so you need a very good you know storage system that helps you recollect what was the step that your opponents had taken in a series and this will help you anticipate what could be the probable movement of your opponent if you make this type of move
then i have another definition which is called ga which is so this is my once again this is my network in the top ga is given as power available from the network upon power available from source so this is equal to pavn upon pavs
so, this unbound medium follows the helmholtz equation right and we know that the solution to this is a plane wave solution right
now, i will combine the small signal picture of the voltage control voltage source or the source follower which we have synthesized with a suitable bi and the load is connected there
you have another category of systems where masonry is used
but, that means you have to find out the initial values of the your, what you call voltage across the capacitor initial, because switch is moved now
as well as process of this experiment are usually very very standardized
if instead of gain, we get attenuation then we can show that the noise figure will be equal to the attenuation
i was hoping to not get into it, but i will let us write this over here
this is the power semiconductor switch which is going to turn on and off and it is getting the gate drive signal from a pw block and the pwm block is given with a control reference of minus point 1
whereas, the non magnetic materials like air or wood or any of them will not allow the magnetic field lines to pass through so easily; which means if i have to have probably the magnetism produced in the coils here in the stator and ultimately, i have to induce electricity in the conductors here
so lets go to that example
your name
so, v by 25 plus v by 50 is equal to 1 plus 3 by 2 your i x, but question is this i x is given actually this is your i x
so, you do not form corrosion products right on top of the anode and therefore anode continues to corrode
and also for motor test, we used to have this 40 mm cross 160 mm prism specimens for the continuous monitoring of carbonation depth
because this was the original circuit original circuit and here the current was flowing like this it was flowing for both positive and negative halves
so now a zero is selected
as we discussed in the previous video, one thing that was quite characteristic of every hardware trojan is that it is small, typically a few lines of code occupying a very less area in the entire design of the ic and secondly it is stealthy, stealthy means that it is mostly passive during the normal working of the device or the ic as well as during most of the testing process the trojan is a passive and inactive and the trojan only gets activated when specific triggers are obtained
basically, the state diagram is constructed following all rules of signal flow graph which we have seen till now using laplace transformed state equation
so, when this is actually facing the maximum flux of the north pole, this will simultaneously phase the maximum flux of the south pole
these fall into this category of bugs in the systems software
so, that is kilowatt hour, because kilowatt is the power and hour is the time
so, 3 phase magnetic field as soon as it is create the because of this your you are what you call that, we if you if we neglect the leakage resistance and reactance like transformer then the a voltage also will be induced in the stator winding in each space right
let us look at the set of square x, for x in range 100, such that x is even
so by doing this i am making the wires longer
so, in this demo will be showing how a stack can be manipulated to actually skip an instruction
they now have a pervasive presence, they convey emotions and tone of voice in online communication and are easily understandable
and this one is v l is equal to this is your v l is equal to j i x l; j means angle 90 degree right
and this requires very careful market study and analysis
but of course, maintainability is possible only to a limited extent
total cost, including the selling and distribution cost was 255,000s and we got the sales value
i am going to have i by 2 flowing here and i by 2 flowing here, right
so, this is where you write the code to search and then you actually make the call and that is how you should go ahead with doing design and as you go ahead your finding that i said that i will not give you the details of the helper classes because their interfaces, their member functions will kind of get derived from your design because we have just seen this requirement for an address book
next the function readsms
5 8 queens dot py
so, we would initially start with an empty board and with row 0
so, for that we will take a counter
there is also another way classifying semiconductors
so, this is singularity there
we have done this because in the next module, we will need to use this notion of casting in the context of binding
a list is a sequence of values, and implicitly there are positions associated to this sequence starting at 0 and going up to the length of the list minus 1
so, it is coming 100
so, if i if i go to the next slide what i will see ill see that i had to compare the ideal op amp versus real op amp
let us see function generator and what he is applying right now
vo is the output with respect to ground
let's check the boundary conditions quickly
so if i expand my s parameter matrix then i should get this s 2 1 is equal to s 1 2 because of the reciprocity as we have already discussed
well, you can ask that: how do i know these values
but geometric mean of l 1 l 2 less than the arithmetic mean of l 1 l 2 if they are not equal
so, if you do so, if you do so, if you write, if you write kvl here look, how you are write it
so, let us formally these integral equations
that means this, this, this internetwork tree, what we are drawing
so, now, let us start with as with any problem in computational em we start with maxwell’s equations right, at the end of this course you will be amazed that how every problem we just start with these two or four equations and we get a solution ok
we use the three category of the workers
so, now if we look into the application code here, we are constructing two such objects object 1 and object 2, as you can see that my class does not have any constructor
if you miss the minus sign or plus sign if something goes wrong, then your technique your numerical value numerical value may remain same, but the sign ah will create problem
and if the buying price is lesser as compared to the manufacturing price, so we can easily take a decision in favor of buying it ready made from the market rather than manufacturing it
and by definition whatever equivalent we come up with will be linear because we will be neglecting all the higher order terms
so, payment will be for how much
this is something which is called useful skew
so this has come basically from the relationship l is equal to lambda n square
so, by dividing the cost into total cost into variable and fixed cost, we move step by step in this case
on other hand in case of full duplex we have separate transmission and receiving time lines
pitch means in a particular ah area or within a particular length means how many lines you can draw
here we have a scope it is a declarative region, within which i can have variety of different identifiers, variety of different symbols
that as time progresses i will not allow such random or drastic moves
the curve which is corresponding to op that represents the initial condition
so, if i just say, ideally the term acm into vcm should not be there and vo should be nothing but just ad into vd; this is the ideal situation
department must take a view on how this should be divided but also it is a question of whether we should be saying to our graduating students and to young practitioners, listen, what you have got now is just the ticket out the door
so, once you have to find out short circuit current, another is you have to find out the your ah in 1 and 2 ah norton equivalent circuit right
some function in space separating them
if there is no physical illness, i am not talking of somebody is having a seizure or a congenital problem
going forward we will see the next experiment which is on gas permeability, we have seen chloride based test and moisture based test and gas also becomes a very critical factor
so now we are going to place this specimen on the frame
yes, there is another head expense we'll have to look at fixed expensive for rent property and taxes and miscellaneous payrolls and other items are $55,000 monthly which we have already taken
so, exactly similar to what we did in the previous example i will calculate this integral on by both ways
so, the way to make it smaller is by reducing the value of vg
5d as 50 so this is what we are getting and fub by fu we we get 0
5 into d this i can make this is coming 24 but i can take 30 right so pitch as 40 if we consider and edge as 30 we consider then kb i can find out as least of e by 3d0 that means 30 by 3 into d0 p by 3d0 minus 0
so, that is actually 1
so let me write this a little differently i am going to say p is actually the number of poles which is already decided for a given machine z is the number of conductors which is also decided for a given machine a is also decided for a given machine 2 pie of course is a constant so, i am going to write like this multiplied by phi omega
there are several companies under tattas like tcs or tata motors or tata steel, but the brand name is tata
in the next class, we will learn more about these planes
i will take one small example in detail when we will go right, but these are the basic philosophy
at the connection terminals of antenna
now you will find in the wipos definition that they talk about patents they talk about copyrights they talk about trademarks designs and similar rights
u, which is c times half epsilon zero
in that case the value of friction is given by fs, plus minus is basically used to show the direction of the friction which will be applicable in the body
this is i, this is i 2 square, this is your i 3 square like this
so, we will discuss the application of the transfer function when we will discuss the network stability and network synthesis concepts later in the course
and so this causes an additional bending moment and it is essential to consider this additional bending moment
so, looking at this formulation that we did so far right; so for example, if i wanted to take one equation so, remember this gave us a n cross n system of equations, which we use to solve for rho
you see, in this example i have shown four input output pads indicating in, out, vdd and ground, and one gate right
going by this description of the way equal to equal to and is work; obviously, if list2 list3 are the same object they must always be equal to equal to
so this is in russian, the russian pronunciation if i get it right it is (теория решения изобретательских задач) teoriya resheniya izobretatelskikh zadatch and the acronym for that is triz is this is the theory that he pulled out of the algorithm after trying it so many times
of course the kind of deflection that you see in the wall is an exaggerated deflection and you are not going to be able to see so much of deflection
if it is same as before
and, now if i bring it down a lot like this; that means, if i increase v 1 a lot ok, v 1 is really a lot ok, then there will be only one intersection ok
and often you would find that impatient students as well as impatient participants in any professional dialogue, can of an interrupt the speaker to ask the questions and this is normally done to pick up the non verbal accompaniments of speech
so in compound, of course, we will be looking at differential and cumulative both we will be looking at and then we will be deriving the speed torque characteristics for each of this motors, we will be deriving the speed torque characteristics or relationship for each of these motors
so, both currents are z directed and radius is much smaller than wavelength ok
especially when we come to the type approach, i will very clearly tell you that find these are the early propositions and these are the modern propositions and therefore each of this approach might not get same degree of time when we talk about it here
so, this portion will come to the this side this portion will come to this side, but meaning is same i mean everything is same just look
the reason being is that this payload would successfully overflow the buffer and it will overflow the return address and modify the return address and at the return of the function it would try to execute code from the stack
you have assign the value of node voltages as v 1, v 2 and v 3 that means you need three equations to solve because you have now three unknowns v 1, v 2 and v 3
here again, the load is three phase it can be star or delta connected or it can be balanced or unbalanced
id has to be flowing through this and this vds, the quiescent drain source voltage has to be more than vgs minus vt
now, if you think in terms of the kind of social expectation that society is over period would have had and the inability of human beings; many a times that would have given them a realization that i am not capable of doing this or this is going beyond my control
if you were to examine this in terms of the stresses, you have pre compression stresses in the wall because of the self weight and because of the superimposed loads
so, current is entering here is dot is taken right and in this case you are what you call another dot is taken here another dot is taken here right, say current is your what you call leaving and here it is taken that current is entering this 2 dots we have taken
now, if we are looking a view from this direction, what we are supposed to see is this l portion, we are supposed to see
for top view the same procedure ab line makes 30 degrees, bc line makes 30 degrees, construct the parallelogram; then from b all the way to this third point, similarly b, all the way to fourth point by transferring 3 and 4 points from this rectangle
now, without actually doing all the math, you can see what will happen to the first term over here
so, you could do forward problem in fem inverse problem like this right and
and from top view we will be in a position to sense clearly whether it is a circular hole or elliptical hole and at what level it is located these dimensions
now, use inclined angle to make it equal number of divisions on both sides, divide the line; it can be beginning from a to c, or it can be from a ah c to a also, it is perfectly fine
so, what is h using basis functions h is at any point inside any triangle h is a linear combination of the t’s and the weights are the unknown u’s right
so, let us start with the unix login process, the login process for system is started at boot time and it runs with superuser privileges, so it request for a username and password, so when the user enters the password a cryptographic algorithm is used on the password with the stored salt and the result is something known as the hash of the password
so, negative cash flow in investing activity is healthy
it is at zero speed
so as we have seen before each thread arena can contain multiple heaps, so these heaps are linked together by linked list
so, therefore, equation 34, then simplified to i 2 dash will be s v upon r 2 dash i mean we are see neglecting x 2 dash
both intel and amd have actually created trusted execution environments in for the processors and in our later lecture we be looking at the intel’s sgx which is intel’s trusted execution environment where enclaves are created in order to run sensitive codes in spite of the entire system being untrusted
in the last class, we were discussing about the various properties of laplace transform
so, i this is your ah this is your ah sorry ah this is your v 2 ah this is your v 2 and this is reference node
one, it can synchronize the research efforts of an institution
so, technically i should not draw it like this
so, if you just have the op amp alone do not ever without all this connections, it is not that these two terminals are going to have same potential no ok
maximum is plus minus 20, plus minus 22 volts
so, this is a damped oscillation such damped oscillations should stop after sometime such oscillations will stop after sometimes
how to construct such kind of surfaces
we used this money for the month of june for the month of july and part of the amount was paid in the month of july at the end of july
there is no clear solution that we can directly reach
there is a base plate a rectangular plate on which this kind of pin is soldered or attached this one
so, the other term x prime and x minus l also negative x is less than l, but it is straight line again and the slope of the straight line is
on the other hand, if i go around the loop on the other side, the same analysis, you will get v
in this case, we want to know that a we can get from a to b, and b among all the ways we can get from a to b we want the optimum one
in this particular context we are looking at replacing current sources by resistors
i had mentioned that smith chart is nothing but a bilinear transformation, bilinear transformation of z plane
so, whenever there are holes, circles and so on, we usually represent by these dash dot lines
you can again see the symbol of enhancement type mosfet; you can see that depletion type n channel mosfet generic and general m mosfet
the 1 by 3 farad capacitor will have the value as 3 by s in s domain
we will not go too much detail into this, but we will just see how this cmos can be used as an invertor
another two examples is when they content centric, that is they have no understanding of the content itself
when suzuki is manufacturing cars and it is selling its cars through the dealers in the market, dealers network in the market, it may be possible that suzuki is giving a, say, 30 days credit to its dealers, that you take the truckload of cars, you sell them in the market, you have to pay for a given truckload of the cars after the period of 30 days
so, you know when you give that that whether you can do it or not, people will say of course i can do it
and what is the 60% of that
in these orthographic projections part 2, we are mainly covering point projections, line projections
this would have been the operating point originally, but now because of the armature reaction they are intersecting somewhere else, so i am definitely going to have a little different value of the operating point that is the voltage as well as the current, both are going to be somewhat different as compared to what actually i visualised originally as the operating point
supposing we put it in the second column, then we get this pattern of block squares
let us see pictorially: if i have a points source, let's make it with green out here
so i am looking at maybe the rms value of the current is a constant
so, a system can also be characterized by means of a differential equation right
there are ways to inter connect with fpga software to force that certain blocks must be mapped to the clbs which are located in a close neighbourhood, within a rectangular region, those you can specify
when the when the primary and secondary winding are electrically connected
we have a common ground here
so for x1 if i draw a magnetization characteristic like this, x2 considering the air gap is lower i should probably create a little bit higher flux or flux density hopefully
walk around that transparent planes so that the views whatever we get that what we call glass box method
now with trustzone enabled processors an additional bit known as the nstid bit the, 33rd bit put the also put out on the bus so this particular bit would identify the current state of the processor
so, power is the time rate of a expanding or a absorbing energy
when clock will be zero, then this gate will be conducting, which means when clock is zero, i have a cross couple inverter with feedback that will constitute a stable storage system
in valuation of the closing stock what is different
purchase account there was only one entry, two creditors, there was a cash purchase of goods for 3,000 and that much is balance carried down for sales sales are on credit side there were two sales one for cash sale the other one was credit sale this is the total sales for the month
can i again use that ball and stick model for silicon to explain p type doping
so, it does not make sense that at loading time we try to resolve all of these hundreds of functions
” a meta analysis of 168 data sets examining judgments of emotions in the face and other nonverbal stimuli indicated universal emotion recognition well above chance levels
we calculated standard labor cost per unit so that was 30 rupees
692 it is based on solving the indeterminate form infinity to the power infinity into zero indeterminate expression applying the l hospital's rule to this indeterminate expression we get log 2 which is 69 percent, 69
what is considered as the distinct characteristics of the person the words which represent them are either svabhava or prakriti
this is what we discussed in the previous class that the direction of the current source that is the fictitious current source which we added because of the initial condition of a current i naught flowing through the inductor
so, let us see how we can measure the capacitance of this ceramic capacitor
so, again a part of your good laboratory practices, cool, all right
closing stock of finished goods
if modulus of s22 is greater than 1 then it means all points inside the smith are potentially unstable
so, you can see here right what is the next step
so, if you're looking at one half of the cross section, you have the lateral force acting on the wall
so, this this one we have taken out this output is taken as x 1 right, this delta p g is taken as x 2 in between because you have to make it a state variable this ah output of this one you have taken as x 3 and this one output of this governor time this is x 4 right and this is u this thing
we have material of 100,000s, worth 100,000s, direct wages 25,000s and direct expenses 5,000
now we'll go through a loop of self consistency because i know this m is nothing but its same direction, so i am not writing a vector sign on top
so, integral equation methods; obviously, you can see that they are integral methods and usually formulated in the frequency domain ok
despite these findings we find that the normal associations in people’s mind of red are with energy and passion which remain vivid and are often used as marketing strategy
in the earlier part you have seen the basic concepts elementary concepts of c including data types, variables, operators, expressions and statements particularly the control statements
and the key idea was as we already mentioned over here, we have generalized this del e and del h operator, to now have a 1 by e x 1 by e y 1 by e z term, similarly for the h 1 by h x 1 by h y 1 by h z ok
or this can be further optimized, so we avoid making recursive calls altogether and we just directly fill in the table in dependency order which must be acyclic otherwise this sub problem will not be solvable
but in some cases we will we also apply plus 15 volts and minus 12 volts, plus 15 volts and minus 12 volts that will be my unbalanced power supply, there will be my unbalanced power supply ok
for autotransformerinput i have to see the input; input here this is the whole winding
this is 35 percent aggregate and 65 percent paste that is not a typo you normally see it the other way in mortars and concrete, this is 35 percent aggregate 65 percent paste, you need that amount of paste to satisfy the workability and the strength criteria ok and we get 170 mega pascal after 90 days with all these mixes which have 30 percent cement replacement
the third move says you pick up a block at random, you change the orientation
5 degrees, 45 degrees and so on up to 90 degrees
now, naturally the ratio has gone down because in the first ratio that is fat we had taken in the denominator only fixed assets
these flaws could be intentional hardware trojans that are inserted at the time of manufacture by third parties
so this, as i said, most of the modern chips that if i fabricate, there we have channels and thats why we use channel routers
so, this term within this bracket refers to the sum of all the loops gains, i
so, here i show 3 different kinds of entries
so, you might find it confusing when they say tm or te just see which of the z component is being set to 0 ok
when we get these two values we can simply use the equation which we derived that is for ir it is v naught by r e to the power minus t by tau, and find the various parameters like voltage or current in the circuit
so certainly all those type information is gone because now i do not need to maintain enumerated type values to know what kind of object i have
this you can say is an electronic switching device, there is no mechanical moving parts like in an electromechanical relay
and again we know how the diversity of ideas the various perspectives can enrich one’s own learning
originally our field energy was opq
so, you know that individual components you can represent as their laplace transform
so, this energy can be retrieve because it is an ideal capacitor, so it will not dissipates energy by itself
so, this is the answer ok
so, these are all constants for a meter and theta f is the angle is the maximum angle where the pointer or the coil moves ok
so, it is a lot of process
in the first level of nesting, just to ensure that my r14 value does not get lost, we are using a multiple register store instruction stmfd
so, or v t i mean upon simplification just cross multiply and simplify, you will get v t is equal to actually what we what i am doing is this the up to this it is written your, what you call all the time not putting your, what you call v t, v t, v t right
also this the expression over here for a m n that you can see over here this is where you can use your gauss legendre quadrature rules, or any other quadrature rules to evaluate this matrix element
let us consider, let us consider this entirely filled by this orange one ok
you know they will fall down at the base and you can tilt the dish very gently and you can aspire it out the single cell suspension and put it back in the test tube
this is the dark field mask
x2 is nothing but dx1 by dt which you can get from these two equations
if it is less than that we use other dimension from away, like that
they also have templates of agreements; for instance, various agreements like a joint venture or a joint collaborative research, joint development of technology, industrial consultancy, inter institutional agreement technology licensing agreement
so although the total delay is sixty six, but some of the outputs you can drive with the delay of thirty three, ok, as if this is of course much faster than this forty five
so, this arrangement provides an operating point of 3 volts and an increment of vs between vgs
these are from 2 perspectives
we have to short circuit the output port and apply a voltage v 1 in the input port and solve the equations
