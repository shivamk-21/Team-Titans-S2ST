now, the number of equations necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is in fact always 1 less than the number of principal nodes
okay, which is in your case, so we have assessment score
you see this circuit where the inputs are d, t c, s d, clock and q
it is this side right
you have to take the help of theorem network topology
and very soon it is hoped that it would allow a robots to serve in social spaces
keywords amplifiers, opams hello, previously we have studied inverting, non inverting and difference amplifier using op amp
8 kilonewton meter similarly the reactions are support that is reactions are support or shear force that will be wl by 2 so 8
now all users and their corresponding hashed passwords are stored in a file called etc/shadow, so what happens is that for the password that is actually entered, and hash computed this is compared with the corresponding user entry in the/etc /shadow
in this course we are using google hangouts you can do facebook live
now, we could have stopped right here; if this is all we wanted to do we could have stopped right here
for some application you are may not be that much aware about the performance, you need very little computational capability, but there are some applications where performance is important
so, this is 5 i 4 minus 4 i 3 is equal to; so, equation 4
we can take any value; let us say 10 kilo ohms
so, we had two representations, a two dimensional representation with 0s and ones and a one dimensional representation which gives us the column position for each row to keep track of the queens in the board, but in order to determine whether a square is free or not, we need to have a better way to compute how the squares are attacked by queens
so, in fact, what we could see, that if it is not high shear means if it is low shear, we could find out eth value as this: 19343, and because of the presence of high shear, the bending moment is reduce to 18095 kilo newton
now, if we have the planner triangulations in that graph, you can map it to a layout or a floor plan
you learn how to pedal, you learn how to balance the vehicle, you learn how to take turns, you learn how to use break entire mechanism you learn
so, what is the information that we have we have that the organization has only one engineering division, where engineers and managers work every engineer reports to a manager and a manager can also work as a engineer
i have lifted it when it is on, you see here, it is on you should not lift any equipment when it is in on state, when the power is on
and it gives empirical limits to which you can actually utilize this effective flange width
however, professor paul ekman and his colleague wallace friesen have built on professor birdwhistell’s work and they have classified kinesics into five types or five categories
so, there is something like a cylindrical kind of portion this is the cylindrical kind of portion and there is inclined slope comes touch that in a tangent direction
parallel on the side is one is equal to e, parallel on side is two, which is equivalent to phi, r being continuous across and interface
so the reason i am going to give you one of the whys is the reason there is lot of smoke as you can imagine
if the time period is short and there are no conditions attached for its conversion into cash, then you can consider it as a cash equivalent
so we start with full custom now
for finding out the value of k n minus 1, we have to multiply each term by s plus p to the power n as we did in this case
beyond this point there is a rapid rise in the rate of expansion of course this need not be perfectly a straight line you could have something like this also, okay
so, we want to really mention those intricate dimensions also that is the reason we are showing it as a separate one with clear cut dimensioning it is having r of 0
for example, if you look at a scale, you find that there are two points say 0 1 2 3, but between 0 and 1 also you will find ten different lines on this scale also
so, i repeat once again for your you know understanding because and if you start in the very first year that it is one in between 0 and one that is this is t 0 is equal to 0 t 1 is equal to 1, but you have to you have to determine the charge entering the element from t is equal to 0 second to t is equal to 2 second
micro expressions can also be controlled voluntary and involuntary
so, it is actually if you take the, if you take the before telling, if you take the slope of this straight line
ok, the transport layer provides the required extension points for the message layer and in this layer the communications are all basically frame oriented
for example, when we were discussing finite difference method is just the unknown are the values of the function at various nodes and we form our equations out of those right
the value of derivative that is first derivative at zero and so on up to the value of derivative n minus 1 at derivative at zero
so you have to be careful about these things
so, then g of r r prime what was this function this was h naught
but he had joint minor in music and here he really like music and it really helps, you know later on, whatever hobby you have a this is very important to have, that a new, you are learning music in and photography for you
and third thing is purchase and discounting of the bills they said chore committee said that yes this should be the very important way and popular way of providing working capital finance
so, there are n terms in this summation; of this n terms in the summation which term will survive
it is going to have each of them is going to have about 150k mva rating each single phase is going to have 150 mva rating
it is a myth nevertheless, i do not know whether most people who are genius really have bipolar, some of them we know they had right
so this r one j this is next term is divided by r two j
so, if the flux is at rated value, the frequency is at rated value, the voltage is at rated value, i can say the core losses will be at rated value, whereas the copper losses are very very minimal
so, first what we will do; we will talk about little bit about series capaci[tor] capacitors also in the distribution systems ah application of series capacitor is restricted ah due to various reasons we will explain that and, but ah, but for high tension you may have series capacitors, but you need to you know have lot of protection different type of protection scheme for the series capacitors and there are many other reasons, but anyway
whereas, that is absent in a transformer, because there is nothing rotating there
ok, ah, this clock i have just mentioned earlier, this clock and power routing, requires some special attention because when you have the clock signals, it is not just the issue of just allowing the signals to be distributed to the different points were should be
we have known these formulas, these methods
these are futuristic technologies, but these are the technologies which we will drive the future
so this is originally what i got as va by k phi, speed is zero i mean torque is zero
so, we can have by taking square root; by taking square root of this particular equation
which region is good to use in a sense that i mean for what value of the r x in this meter we can measure it with better accuracy better appreciation ok
but the basic points remain same that you need to copy the original object in a temporary and actually return that temporary through return by value, because that is what a post operator post incrimination operator will lead and these observations
we will ask for another part to be opened
so, the boundary conditions change because of the increasing wind pressure and the maximum bending moment now moves to mid height of the wall
put it back into this equation that gives me back my phi of r which is what i am interested in right
so, we will right now i have covered the theoretical portion once again, small theoretical portion not ideally in depth, but what we understood is we can design this band reject filter right using and operational amplifier
we have seen and you can see it is because a mobile charges at charges there are charger available in a conductor, it has this specific properties
you could also have different searchers doing different parts of the job
therefore, the potential at this point which is v p so, v p is we can therefore, write v p using potentiality viral rule is v 2 whole divided by r 1 plus r 2 ok
the inductance will not have any effect if it is carrying a steady current
so, this way this whole operation takes place the external code memory access reading takes place this in this fashion
so, that is i guess simple
first, we load the address of the got table into this register called edx
so, their major current assets are the receivables from customers
these aspects of cultural variations and differences would be a compulsory part of each of our discussion
sag template can be relied upon to provide the following; first thing is economic layout, minimum errors in design and layout; proper grading of structures and prevention of excessive insulator swing
this will go to the x plates of the cro
you can see how many lines are there: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
the field observed so, e z squared r theta right
when you just replace opc with csa, in this case the replacement was fifteen percent, small increase but i would say that we can get comparable strength to portland cement concrete
even though the torque may be a constant or the torque deliverability of the machine is a constant, the power is the product of torque and speed
so this becomes one forth of epsilon zero t, zero square
so when you are translating a design specification finally into your layout level specification, there can be some bugs which can creep in during this translation
in these constraints, the static timing analysis can be, can be inbuilt some results of sta and there is some objective function defined which we are trying to optimize
that single one line means single line one line voltage, one line voltage i mean one is star connected source is given this right
so, car stopped i said we both are alive; that means, it has happened at least 1 kilometer away from us
now, for example in this case we have written many organizations have developed such rules of thumb or the threshold levels as investigate all variances exceeding rupees 5,000 or 25% of the expected cost sales whichever is lower
the next type of ratios are known as activity ratios
now again the details of all of these things you may find in device physics course but for us there are three terminals it is usually drawn like this
this is how you define u
now s of course does not come by itself
so, connect one voltage source plus minus the other side at ground
if you produce one unit your variable overheads will be in that proportion and if you use go for the production of 10,000 units your variable overheads will be like that
on the other hand, if the average speed is too fast the listener does not have enough time to interpret fully the message and therefore, would also end up losing interest
now in addition to the mmu the cache memory present in trustzone enabled arm processors is also modified
remember, that things are not so crystal clear and things are not presented in an isolated way
so, the idea here is that if we don't move too far away, let me call this the original solution
that is why i wrote that w m can either be n i e or some linear combination of n i e’s my basic objective is to get enough equations and enough variables
so, op and on are perpendicular with each other, but that is at 19 mm distance
so, p g actually the same i 1 current now flowing after making this your what to call you equivalent one
if you are given the information for 2, that is the information with regard to contribution or profit, contribution in the period one, year one, contribution in the air two, sales in the air one, sales in the air two, you can take the difference, that is a change from year one to year two, you take the difference in both the figures that is in the contribution or profit and sales, and then you can find the pv ratio also in this way or in this manner
we have looked at the waveforms, the input output relationship, and also how to design and simulate them
building closer ties is an obvious outcome because once the university starts commercializing its research and publicizing the technology that is patented by its industry would be interested in having closer ties with the university and the money that is generated from research can be pulled back into running the centre and also in into further research
so when c is zero, it means that i have a open switch
so, now having seen this now that you have refresh your memory about it, if i ask you what would be some of the problems with this approach in terms of accuracy
so, this will become minus 5
so i am showing the best solutions
so, this side of the conductor is moving through a flux density of b with this velocity
at the time of discussing i had mentioned that there are some rules, i had also discussed the ways of simplifying the signal flow graphs and in addition to the methods that we had discussed then, there is also something called masonõs rules
so, if you make d 2 will be 0
so, over a period of three years, you can see there is a gradual rise in current asset
so, i cannot immediately use this equation 4 to solve equation 3, but does it look impossible to do
so, we cannot say that i is of type int or x is of type float, rather it depends on what values assigned and in particular, if a name is used for the first time without assigning a value then python will complain
so i don’t know why he had a paste with such high ten micron pores
now, the number of equations necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is in fact always 1 less than the number of principal nodes

but then by making this assumption we get some very it makes our life of the designer much easier, how does it make it easier
so, if you remember tcs, this return on equity is somewhat lower for reliance
then there is high demand for this marketing research services now
300,000 is given to you
now, either we can take sales upon inventory but more sophisticated would be cost of sales because you know inventory is recorded at cost
for now i will ignore the source resistance rs, later i will put it in and see what the effect is
l by 1 minus d t s or l equals rearranging this equation you will see v0 1 minus d by delta i
so this is going, this is the current going inside the node, others are going outside, coming outside of the node so the summation of all 4 currents will be 0 at this node
so, please complete the exercise and then i will show you the solution
and there is a control register that has to be initialized appropriately
originally there was uniform contact and as the wall starts deflecting you develop these clamping forces, that's the whole, the basis with which we are working
so, this is tangential e and this is tangential h fields right
now, b to b 1 always be visible in the front view
v+x is also known as the incident wave and v x as the reflected wave
so, for a layperson a telephone is how it looks to him
so, from this you can calculate the constraint on c1 and set c1 to be, let's say, 10 times or even more compared to the constraint
you are going to replace e with all these etcetera
so, it means the total cost of material consumed will be direct material cost plus the carriage paid for transporting the material so that way you will calculate the total material cost but since it is given as the carriage outwards it means it is the carriage is paid transportation is paid on the material which is going out of the factory and only finished goods go out of the factory so it means this will be considered as a selling and distribution overhead so we are not considering it here that is the carriage outward
they include bank overdraft, they include payables or creditors, they include variety of outstanding expenses
so, assume the coil can move up to an angle theta f means final angle when the coil stop
during our conversation it is important that we maintain continuously a direct eye contact
there is no change in that but we are also writing n phi equal to li so because of which we are going to take actually l as n phi by i rather than taking n d phi by i
72 into 10 cube by fy is 250 so this is becoming 1022
so in my design, whenever i need a three input nand, i simply pick it up from the library, i put it in my layout
since design curves in the form of pm interaction curves are not developed and readily available for different configurations of masonry reinforced masonry walls
5 eo and wo, where wo is the entire width of the depletion region that is equal to enanawo22ε(na+nd)
now at the point of oscillation, no input needs to be provided to this feedback system
this is physical constant multiplied by the current, so, i am going to call it q
so, if you see the figure below, you will see on the left there are 2 voltage sources connected to the load with the help of 3 transmission lines and load zl1 and zl2 are connected
so, today we will look at the problem of infill interaction with the reinforced concrete frame and whether we should be considering the modeling of the panel along with the reinforced concrete frame and if we were not to be considering this interaction what could be the implications of that sort of a modeling assumption and again what are possible ways of damage limitation in infill, masonry infill panels
now, in this particular example we need to find out the value of i naught that is the current flowing through the segment a b using norton’s theorem
this is we call the complete response much more we will see very soon right
so this will become 30
so, if you give me e and if you give me x i can estimate u and that u i can take and put in over here that is what i can do right
biplab datta and my contacts are given here so that once you view in the slides once you go through this session you can send me a new feedback that you have and i will be happy to respond to them
in either case what will happen is both of them will end up at this state
so, with this i should be continuous able to see the change in the output voltage if the transient response is faster
now to do that we need to have a controller and feedback the output voltage and the controller should take a decision based on the error and accordingly change the duty cycle which is actually the control input for the for most of the controllers now most of the dcdc converters so in order to do this regulation v 0 is fed back and compared with the reference and passed on to a controller which could be a proportional or proportional integral or a pid proportional integral derivative type of controller and the output of which goes to a pwm modulator pulse width modulator and eventually to the gate drive and the switch the switch the controllable switch which we have used till now in almost all of our open loop dcdc converters so this would be the plan while closing the loop so in this section of the video lecture i would i will try to focus on closed looping the converters so i will take examples i will take examples like the buck converter the boost converter and try to close the loop in a negative feedback way and then see how the controller works and then probably we can look at some simulation examples so that you get some practice on how to go about doing the closed loop operation of dcdc converters and same concept similar concept can be applied even to the isolated converters and other dcdc open loop converters which you may encounter in future let us discuss the closed loop operation of the buck converter the process is similar even if it is for any other type of converter
our challenging, our question is how you can determine these two forces in an in vitro cell culture setup
so, now, let us because it does not seem that way, just seem that we have done some make belief world where we have introduced some e’s and h’s and solved this maxwell’s new maxwell’s equations, but let us look at the conclusion right
shunt we said the current is very small whereas series the current is large so i will have large ampere turns for this even by having smaller number of windings, smaller number of turns
similarly if you multiply x, so x into id square also will remain in the system that is the reactive component right, but this part if you make it vanish that x into plus x into i q minus i c square, so this is one thing
if i solve this equation, this will give me all the possible input combinations for which this condition is satisfied and they will constitute this set up test vectors for this fault
so, the cut has to be made such that the area of the cut is not too large in comparison to the size of the flat jack
and the boundary conditions are that change in d perpendicular about an interface is equal to sigma bond and phi of v
so, i know that if i just write integral of d f from a to b right; if you did not know anything else, you would simply write this as the value of the function at in this way fb minus fa right
let us construct a parabola, for example; a parabola has an eccentricity 1 and distance of focus from the directrix
so, this will go down like this and then you see the solution will not be here the solution will be here at the saturation region it will not be here it will be here and then v n will not be equal to 0 if v n will be minus sorry v n will be this and output will be minus this amp
so once you put it in service you can forget about it for decades on, there is no problem at all
so, first case if it is t 1 second case torque is t 2
and the other property is that as the illumination increases the resistance decreases exponentially
we saw earlier that gallium arsenide is an example of iii v compound semiconductor
what are those
so, further the primary leakage reactance is also necessarily higher your what you call higher in an induction motor compared to a transformer
so, you will higher powers of x you will get, but the point is that you cannot ignore the first term; the first term will always be there right
so, it depends upon the mobility and dh is kthh
so this is the imaginary gamma and this is the real gamma
so, now, what do i have to specify for the fields to be unique on which surface
as the most important construction material that we have
this is in contrast with the list, where if you have an empty list and then try to insert at a position which does not exist, you get an index error
49 for welded steel sections and the lambda lt the non dimensional slenderness ratio can be calculated from this formula uhh where uhh we need to know again the value of mcr mcr is the elastic uhh sorry uhh lateral torsional buckling moment so mcr can be calculated from this that means the elastic lateral torsional buckling moment uhh that can be found from this expression so once we find the value of mcr then i can find out finally the fbd value and then the md value right fcrb value also can be found from this formula otherwise as i told we can uhh find out from table 14 in which uhh we do not need to calculate in detail through these expressions so uhh simply we can find out the value of kl by ry and hf by tf then we can find out the uhh from table 114 4 we can find out the value of fcrb so once we find the value of fcrb we can find out fbd correspondings to fy and and fcrb so once we find fbd value then we can find out the md the design bending strength now with this formula now let us calculate the design bending strength of a section so first we will see that to calculate the design bending strength of islb 300 okay so if we use islb 300 0
so, this is the position b this is position a ok
go to trim entities, remove this part, remove this part and also we do not really require this one also, this one
to generate an elf executable for hello dot c, you could run this command like this, gcc hello dot c minus o hello
the frame if it becomes lower than the largest task size then that's not a good schedule
so, i am going to have actually a 3 phase auto transformer sitting in between so that i will able to apply variable voltage if i want to
and understanding of the paralanguage and it is significance in our social life has also been a clear literary understanding
if you simplify you will get i a is equal to root 3 i ab angle minus 30 degree
this is the surface over which one to find electric flux
this is a normal ramp, this is a digital ramp
now, talking about interfacing very typically we use some kind of a resistance divider circuit
so, either we have the budget already prepared for the 6 lakh also and the 8 lakh also and if it is not there already we have put the formula in the system, the moment you convert that 7 lakhs into 6 lakhs or 8 lakhs or the figures will automatically be converted and within no time the budget will be ready
now, in addition, you can have some registers and some extra pins for testing, for interfacing with the rapper, some serial input, serial output, something like test control and so on, and there are some test instructions, as i said, which are also fed serially
then you have external ettringite which forms because of penetration of sulphate from the external environment, okay this is what we are trying to consider in the case of sulphate attack and there is of course delayed ettringite formation about which we will talk a little bit in the last few slides of this lecture
it is that, that will not conduct
so, even if you do not have any data member in the derived class, it will still have a lot of data members which are all the data members of the base class, but it can further add more data members
but you have to keep in mind this power p is a time varying quantity and is called a instantaneous power
so the idea is that if we use buffers to break a long interconnection into shorter interconnections, your overall delay will be less
my electrons from here will get attracted towards the drain and we know that when this happens we can show the drain current in this particular direction right
however, q one is zero, sigma two is zero and q two is also zero
so, we with the help of this updated circuit, you can easily find out the value of ix is nothing but 10 that is the value of the voltage source then we divided by 4 ohm resistance
you have to see the peak to peak voltage, look at the peak to peak voltage
so, it is interactive and even further children identify because its other characters like them who are interacting with each other and with the content
faster the clock, faster would be the operation
now the various fault simulations algorithms can be classified as follow
i am rajaram lakkaraju from iit, kharagpur
so, that means, your v 0 is equal to 8 into i because this is 8, this is i, 8 into i
so, between the pointers and references, both refer to addresses
in the form of leakage parameter, i would rather represent that by an inductance drop which is known as the leakage inductance drop or leakage reactance drop
so, we have temperature values of n i in centimeter cube, so 200, 300, 400 and 500 and the values of n i 10 to the 7
so, where mu is equal to mu 0 into mu r, it is called absolute permeability right
you will see here, let us see
so, we swap it again then we look at the root, in this case 24 and we find that 33 is bigger than 24
hertz is nothing but frequency right
so, what i am going to do is if i choose these points basically to be the midpoints of the segments, then i have a very clear unambiguous way of specifying how to solve this problem right
cloning as it implies that we sometimes may need to duplicate a gate
now, this s i m 2 actually voltage stability index of node m 2 right
we just actually started off with this discussion in the last class, we said that when we are actually applying full voltage whether it is a weekly excited dc motors or series motor or shunt motor either way if we are applying full voltage to a dc motor when the speed is 0, i am going to have essentially back emf equal to 0
but, how will you teach it to that machine the curve has to pass in that way or the tool bit when you are machining it has to go along that kind of surface
a second leader called dart leader may also stroke usually following the same path taken by the first leader; almost the same path, but here in the diagram we cannot show the same path; then you cannot see anything that is why little bit this thing, but pattern if you see that both are following the same path
2,500
5, this diameter can vary from 1
i told you in the previous classes during the budget discussion that either in terms of the percentage or in the absolute value we can fix up the threshold level because ultimately the cost and benefit analysis we have to do every time and in case of the variance analysis also that analysis is important
so fb is 1
fine, so lets come back to the four bit adder once more
but if you can redraw the circuit in such a way that it can become a planar circuit then you can use the mesh current method to analyse it
now this particular flaw much in several years later was then exploited by cryptographers to create a tax on ciphers and therefore predict secret keys of the cipher by exploiting this floating point bug
interest cost is also high and it has gone up substantially
and then these are the other critical locations, the edges of the walls and the edges of the opening itself where specific requirements have to be adhered to as far as how much steel, at what distance are you giving from these important locations
so, in that case what you will do you will take the load impedance converted as if it is connected to the primary side
till then you just look at these slides look at what i have taught, , understand thoroughly what does what, and how exactly the oscillator works
so now we will be, after preparing the cost sheet, first part and calculating the works cost, we will now moving to prepare the second statement that is the income statement
if at all i am using an induction machine generator this has to be true definitely and we are not really talking much about this when we were discussing induction machine because we never talked about it as a generator much, that is the only reason we did not talk about it
the range right; so if i am going to be able to solve this equation f should be inside this range, otherwise there is no way that l will map anything and get me f alright
mind you, you are placing a flexual steel farthest away from the center line of the wall itself and therefore you're concentrating the flexual steel
what is done is that there is a virtual address put out on the bus so this virtual address goes into the memory management unit so a typical 32 bit arm core would put out a 32 bit virtual address on this particular bus
so, it is 0 here it is 0 here, but it is nonzero only for this small time interval ok
now, let us rework the link list example by using the friend class concept
by giving a number 1 or 0 here, we can get that number copied at the output
that is basically the node you have already taken as a reference node, so the i x would be v 1 divided by the 16 ohm resistance, so v 1 by 16 is i x
it is integrable
so, reactive fields and energy is transferred between the e and h fields
the quantum efficiency is given and tau is the recombination life time of the carriers
so, in the cost sheet, in this problem, we did two things
the column is restrained in position but not in direction of both ends
so, at the extra high voltage level switching surge thing is the main concern for the insulation
at a different frequency i have this as the gain, so how can i keep my gain constant
so, after getting v thevenin and r thevenin, let me clear it
now, i would like to really make this object maybe bit big or small using smart dimension
the major cycle is the lcm of the task periods and here there are only two periods, 10 and 20
so the current is i
we continue with the strength of masonry
so, current the v, v is given
actually yeah, we have to move to the relative frame of the antenna element, so, even the original thing is fine as long as you are sure that z and z prime are in the same
this hug which was so much against the british norm of behavior, so much against the royal protocol made the global headlines
let's do this integral
so, then i have a full 3d volume integral which is fairly involved to solve ok
there is no match that you can try out because if there is no parameter, then what type you are going to match between the type of a actual parameter and the type of the formal parameter
so when you want to route one, you try to put them in this first track, because one is the vertex, which no incoming edges, so one will have to lay out first
there are the companies like onida, videocon, who had a very larger market share and their product was considered as a pride to the owner
so this will give me essentially i d lambda, so i d lambda in the absence of any movement gives me directly whatever is the field energy that has been accumulated for a small duration dt
let me also tell you when you want to buy a microphone of this type for some experiments, you will find that there are some products available that already have this circuitry built into it
so, it comes actually 3
also if you are thinking about visuals they need to be pedagogically meaningful and not included just for attractiveness
this was the original operating point, this will be the new operating point as per the armature reaction effect is also included
for that dimensions we have to show, it is phi is 6 millimeters of dimension
so all i need to do is take the x component of this field due to a wire at a distance, x and arrow distance here
so, question is that if both dots are here, it will be plus if either of this either it is here or here or it is here
so, for standard towers for normal or average spans the sag and the nature of the curve catenary or parabola, that the line conductor will occupy under expected your loading conditions in evaluated and plotted on template, but the let me tell you one thing for sag template all these things are given it may not be your exactly to your design, but you have some kind of ideas
different shades of green are also used in marketing strategy
so when you get this current can simply put the value in the average power p that is nothing but irms square of and you will get the power absorbed by the resistor that is 133
so as soon as i put on the switch, the equation i am going to have is e m f, which is e m f, equals v v
so, the correct answer is setting over here if you started from 0 0 what will happen
it simplifies the drawing
so, if you do so, it will become del f will become delta p g minus delta p l divided by d plus 2 h upon f 0 into s; this way it will come
now as we mentioned in the previous video all of these techniques though successful to a certain extent are very easily evaded by trojan developers essentially we could write hardware trojans that specifically could bypass all of these techniques that have been developed to detect hardware trojans
so, the potential difference between these two terminals is e
so shear stress in the weld due to direct force will be p by l into t and stress due to bending as we told that because of eccentricity bending will come into picture moment will come into picture so stress due to bending if we write pb this will be m by ip into r r is the radial distance
the pulse function which you already saw right so the pulse was right it is 0 over here and 1 over here
5 percent upon one percent of f 0
5 millimeters or lower than that
now, let us try to understand another concept called concept of controllability
but here i am using this stable signal first to control this multiplexer
they are parameterized by type which is a complete a new concept now coming in
while in the second run the same libc library is present at the 0xb75de000
and then your in situ stress level at each point that you take the measurement is nothing but the in situ the flat jack pressure p multiplied by these two factors
so, before we use a name in an expression on the right hand side it must be assigned a valid value
so if you are examining wind forces as wind pressure acting on the wall you could examine the capacity or where earthquake forces then you could examine the problem as the inertial force acting on the wall as the face loaded forces
but what i am trying to just show is here i have a bound set which is a specialization of set, this is templatized, this also is templatized and this has a part of it as a component is has a list which as a part of it has a vector
so here you have to consider this charging, discharging for all the nodes, not only the output node, right
vertical plane, horizontal plane and line is inclined to horizontal plane, but it is parallel to vertical plane
so, this is one complete turn of this coil ok
for example; a large number of lbd activities should be at recall and understand levels so that learners can get a lot of practice in just applying the concepts in testing their understanding of the concept
first step is preparing the upper part trading account of the income statement
however, the demonstration i showed you was those where no change of area took place
so, all of this you did not have to really worry about that much when you did integral equation methods here it is important to do this very good
if it has a source i there will be an e z i b that is all very simple to deal with ok
so, here this i will flow always therefore, the original circuit is not changed, but the meter gets current only for half of the time
if we could have a simple expression for gamma in then it would be easier to design sections
check it ground where suddenly at certain point of time the depth appears although the ground is flat, the kid will go and stop there right, darkness snakes
so, v an is this point, this is my phase voltage
they satisfy one particular relation, where your p any point p on that curve, supposed to satisfy this relation
5 mpa and therefore all requirements have been satisfied in this particular stage
and therefore procedure a would require that you look at at least three levels of pre compression and then you would have at least nine specimens in all
if i take the transpose of this equation then what i get isé now we know that u and z are symmetric for a reciprocal network if both u and z are symmetric that is the case for reciprocal network then this whole expression must also be symmetric, so then in that case we can simply write s transpose as equal to z plus you, the transpose term this term gets transit so only we will have the inverse
you need to put here land, plant, machinery, buildings, furniture and the other fixed assets
for instance, remember when we try to printout all the queens we ran through every possible position for every queen on every row, and if it was free then we tried it out and if the solution extended to a final case then we print it out
so, this was actually to develop the anode side, that means the passive current
on the internet there are several tools which would help you in building these rop programs
63 volts per microseconds
again, please look at the left side, do not look at the right
you can also think you can also use a potentiometer then this current at null condition will be 0
genuine smiles are generated by when conscious brain which means we are zygomatic
okay, so note that the each of these gadgets has a few instructions and then has a return or a returnf or call instruction at the end
in this case everywhere there is photoresist except this area
so, if you from equation 1, 2 and 3, 4 you substitute all these things
ok, now grid working algorithms mainly can be classified as maze routing and line search algorithms, as we shall see
all the direction is taken like this, but if i if you apply kcls at this point you take and this direction in this direction the current this
so, i can integrate it, how many terms do you expect will happen
sir then there will be points where we cannot do anything
now based on that assumption, your geometry is simplified and you can actually work on a simple analytical form that accounts for additional capacity coming from the arching action
so, this is actually not what the fdtd is going to implement, this is an analysis of the fdtd yeah
so, of the active regions is only a few nanometers thick whether it is in 1d, 2d or 3d you can get different orders of quantum confinement
then through a resistance, i connect to this end of the breadboard and from this end that is vertically connected, i will put it to vcc
that is your r 1 is equal to basically delta f upon your delta p g 1 other way we are writing delta p g 1 is equal to delta f of r 1
so, this part is going to become very small and this part will nominate right
if we find that it is not within that, then possibly or circuit will fail
so, we have purchased five units
in last modules, we have gone through the characteristics of an operational amplifier, such as input bias current, what exactly input bias current means, and how it is going to affect the operational amplifier
so, balance sheet is one which shows you the financial position of the organization
now, since the direction of current is opposite of the polarity of the voltage so what will happen
i am using 1000, and some threshold that again can be chosen through experimentation; depends on the temperature where you want to start the alarm
for pre increment for it is built in type it is a original object which actually a gets increment and then object comes back so you should use a return by a reference as a refer post increment you get an old value of the object so it will have to be a new object
so, above 345 kv switching surges become the major factor of flashover, consideration and will more likely control the insulation design
next time a next lecture what we are going to see, we are going to see the depletion type n mos transistor and again we will see the construction to the drain characteristics
ok, so this is my time
so, everything is red, because my pen is red
38 if you solve this one omega is equal to f is 60 hertz, so 2 pi a and c is equal to 1 upon omega into x c
different researchers have told us that by the time a child is 3 years old, the child has imbibed these social codes
if i take a small box here, all right, then the area integral area on this side of the box is going this way: field insides, since this is a metal field inside is zero
so, what you do in that is basically, i am there is not much functionality given, you just do a construction and there is a print in which you can print these two fields, so just for illustration
so, next, the unit ramp function may be advanced or delayed right
which runs at synchronous speed inducing emf in the stator winding which balances the terminal voltage under the assumption that the stator resistance and react[ance] leakage reactance are negligible
so, it means the cost of the additional 500 units will come down by the cost of the plant by the way of not adding the depreciation to the next 500 units
now, again you have to calculate as we calculated in this case we will have to calculate in this case also 40 cages, i will put it in the bracket opening stock
here we have shown different variety of drawing boards; the classical one is using a wooden structure
if they are connected by a thin wire passing through their center, a current start flowing through the wire
other interesting thing is that if i traverse an electrical length beta d along a transmission line, the total phasor change on the gamma plane is twice of that value
so, the second component, mu into sigma, so strictly speaking you should be able to characterize what is the dilatency and what is the angle of internal friction to be able to understand the resistance offered by the joint itself
now one more thing i want to emphasize here is that these equations are written assuming that both vgs and vds are positive
so, this is this shows the; that means, this voltage magnitude is v p and this one is parallel to this will write here this is also v p right, so that is why it is drawn it here dash line it is shown
86 close to 50 hertz, right
so, this is a typical example
so, you can simply say that this particular circuit is reciprocal circuit
so, but what the paris convention did was it brought together the need for having a harmonized patent regime
so the power supplied by this voltage source which is going into the port one of the network that is v1 i1
this minus sign is coming because i have chosen i in this direction ok
we can calculate vdsb as vnpb by gamma mb, where gamma mb will be 125
because now i know, although there is no physical current, curl of b is equal to mu, zero, epsilon, zero, d, e, d, t, and curl of b between the plates is not going to be zero
the problem is this can be examined as a system that is subjected to even under gravity forces different deformability across the cross section
on this side, minimum three lambda should be there
we have paid the different price
mass muscles move, cheeks rise, eyes squeeze up and eyebrows deep slight
so, we have this cylinder
now, if you try to write the acceleration of the electron, you have the term e e, which is the same as before, so that is the effect of the external field, but you also have a solid where you have a lot of atoms
total amount of that input given, total quantity of that input given we have to find out
so, it is depression whether it is because of adjustment disorder because of something else or endogenous depression and it has to be treated with psychotherapy or
this is not always a negative sign
now, i have already started saying in terms of why we need these, because i wanted to read and write static data members
so, basically there are two types of elements which you will see one is passive element another one is active element
if they are continuously not being able to do anything, then tell them why; where are you going wrong
so, this is the special say; we will look into this registers once we go into the register file of 8051
so from the target cell t, we systematically backtrack towards the source cell
that is prims algorithm
you can see one x is zero, this goes to v
so, that is the advantage of using reference and doing the call by reference mechanism in c++
so, if you use this symbol also absolutely correct or if it is a pure dc then this one this one also can be used for a pure dc
i will do pmmc here an electrodynamic instrument here
so first we saw that our z in which is the function of a 0 and omega 0 should be equal and opposite to z l and this in turn can be further reduced to 1
this leading 0, we show it in metric system, if it is inches it will be just
so, how about we see the other multimeter, right which is the orange one, let me switch it off always remember if you do not switch off the multimeter it will consume the battery
so now what we have is
and that; that means, same equation that equation 65 for method 2 only we will use here, because are all will try to find out in terms of your voltage magnitude, right
now first thing that i want to state about these filters is that now a day’s not many of the filters that are designed, are designed as image filters, but they had a special place in the olden days when synthesis methods were not that developed
one is called a block, a bond and a coms
éwhere this xt is given aséas i said x of t is a measurable quantity known as the spectral density
we took a domain and we discretized it into little little squares, in a 2d problems squares, in a 3d problem cubes right and the simplest way to solve this was using what is called a pulse basis function
so we are checking this at every step there can be multiple intersections, like in this case
for example, let us consider this dimension is 25 mm, this one 25 mm is correct fit
r e is equal to x e and r c is equal to given 600 ohm
let's say we have circuits where voltages are much larger than
so, that is the first part of ip intelligence identifying research results with commercial value
micro expressions are key to understanding the complex emotional world we live in
finally, it reaches at 0
so, you can see this peak is higher than the this peak right
so, now let us take a, this is a dielectric material; dielectric material has finite conductivity right
if i have one size of aggregate the best i can do is to get a packing fraction of 0
you just just assign them to one or more metal layers and, as i had said, depending on the current requirements, you said the width of the different nets segments
so, we will go to mate, we will go to advanced mates; then, this is profile center over here
so we will continue our discussion on various theorems with respect to ac analysis
and next we have seen shot noise, we have seen the burst noise, we have seen the popcorn noise, we have seen the avalanche noise right
breaking there is, so into smaller pieces or smaller units or small chunks has advantages as well
this will again chip
so what are the faults which can change at least some thing
now, this object we remove, but we would like to really view that on the projection plane
similarly if we would like to discuss the branch line hybrid, so that is an example of a, so this magic tee was an example of a, it was an example of a 180 ¡ coupler and this branch line hybrid coupler is an example of a 90¡ coupler
for now, i will just show you a simple example of how the resolution is done using exact match and talk a little bit about what is a scope of exact matching and what is the scope of promotion
anything you find that wrong calculation or anything then i will rectify it
in this example the switch is open at time t is equal to 0 and the resistance r which is given in the figure is 5 ohm, so what happens the switch is initially closed and when it is opened the circuit is converted into series rlc circuit
so, we have to construct in such a way that base and axis are inclined and edge also supposed to be inclined
and the voltage drop across the transistor, vds, the operating point vds equals vd minus id0 times rd
so, here at this point, it will come some residual flux will be there
so, this is how that your when we are not considering the losses so, this is the phasor diagram
so, we are actually looking at the transformer under open circuit conditions
0235 because of this your ah frequency excursion that this term is a this is this is this ah your delta pg s s will cannot be equal to 0
similarly, for insertion sort, in order to sort the full list, we need to sort all the elements excluding the first one what is called the tail of the list, and in turn we need to sort its tail and so on
and the second that the researcher has a big control over, place, time, circumstances, and participants
you can improve the dynamics by reducing the capacitance value and also play around with the l value to adjust the ripple current value and then save it then you can try what happens
so we continue with our discussion on various tree distribution strategy in our next lecture
or if we have light sources at two locations, they will be emanating in radial directions; but all these things internally reflected, finally focus two points f and f prime
a standard way to do this in using what we have already seen, is to use the command the the statement in to check whether the value b already occurs as a key in scores
in what ways can we provide these various resources
in a similar way, for example, you have the data section, which is 3 over here and you notice that 3 has the flag wa, so w stands for write
so in this loop, it will go along 1, 2, 3 again 1, 2, 3 like this
most of the time what we use is, plus minus 15 volts
so, this line, and this, it stops it because we start seeing this green portion from here to there
so, after second iteration we have just seen that, voltage v2 is 0
so we have one of them conjugate; that is what is important
this multiplied by 10; 10
5d0 d0 means 18 so 27 so we consider say 30 right so the overall depth i can find out from this that is earlier we found effective depth as 231
so, in this case just have a look, just just 1 minute
now you might have asked me why restrict ourselves to this path, there can be other paths also and absolutely
and therefore, if any of the resource that is used by a task is acquired, already acquired by another task, then that task would have higher priority and the current task could not be allowed to run
it is simply my hankel h 0 2 whatever like
so, here you can see the peak to peak voltage is 2
that means, when this boat will reach 550, 600 nothing will happen to the boat metal of the boat will not get deposited or evaporated, only the material within the boat will get melted and gets deposited or gets evaporated and finally, deposited onto the substrate correct
ok, so these are some delay calculation you can use to actual estimate the clock cycle time and to improve or or optimise one
now, if you consider y0 equal to 0 that is initially this system does not have any value
the parallel stance or at attention is a formal position which shows a neutral attitude without any commitment; either to stay or to go
so, again we find that hall has repeatedly highlighted the significance of cultural understanding of proximity
now at this location we have gadget address 2 which does the addition as we want and as the memory pointed to by edx to the eax register now the push instruction would push the contents of the edi into the stack
if we want to 4 to be replaced by 7, we can just say nested one equal to seven and this will give us the list 2, 37, 7 and then hello and we can do this inside as well
for gamma equal to point two, five, for a certain example you get a tree like this
we know that there are a set of principles called multimedia principles which provide guidelines to integrate multimedia in e learning content effectively
92 right, but 338 kilo hour capacitor size is not available in the market
the name error code will not execute on the other hand, if i had only a name error and if i had a zero division error for example, then because there is a name error first it will first it will come here and will find that there is no index error then will come here and say there is a name error and will execute this code
they just know it is like your teachers, they do not have a background in design; they just know their content that is it
now, let us take examples so that you can better understand the concept of power and energy
we can calculate what is the tensile force on the extreme critical bolt, the tb
now, what the other thing that can happen is they can be axial shortening if there is significant deformation, they can be axial shortening due to compression and then you can look at the deflection itself being treated as a gap that is forming
let us go to readsim900a(), what it is doing it is defining a string called buffer
let's see what happened in the mars pathfinder
so, it is coming 5 into 10 to the power minus 3 joule and second case voltage v 2 was 0
now this is usually not the case when you have discrete component circuits, when you buy these discrete components and build circuits around them
and output responds faster to the changes, that means, slew rate also shows that how fast the output can change ,when we change the input
so, we will go to mate and select concentric
in c89, you could still have boolean values, which can be true or false based on it being an integer value
as we have seen in the previous lecture the nx bit would disable executing from that stack
also recall that a small loop of current is equivalent to a dipole
so, we have got our nice polished samples and then we can see really a lot of things, so two very nice examples i like very much which show the two most common type of supplementary cementitious materials
when we come to semiconductors we will try to modify this definition a little, but as far as we dealing with metals we will use this
point six: suppose i change my signal encoding
now, we have here on this dc power supply, dc power supply, plus 15 minus 15 right
so these cascaded buffers will help you in tackling the large capacitive loads and this intermediate repeaters help you in reducing the total r c delay of this long interconnection line, because this can be a long interconnect
design again the design looks unique it is original and you are the first person to file that design it gets a registration
so project 4 is the most beneficial project in this example
now, because of the way the mouse transistor is, there are some restrictions
so that means, my i 1 t rather i 1
so, like we had the manmuller criterion then defined, then used to define the failure domain as far as shear stress, normal stress was concerned, we do the same thing for lateral force h and axial force n and you actually have three different zones, the sliding shear zone, the diagonal cracking zone and the flexural failure zone and you do see that the sliding shear is typically expected when the level of pre compression is low,al cracking is typically expected when you have intimate levels of axial compression and flexual failure is expected when you have significant pre compression in the wall
that one question you can ask, a legitimate question
now one thing: you see, you go back to the previous design
we follow different notations for these objects, when we are projecting there will be points lines on the drawing sheet
so, look this is the circuit diagram right and it is given that your what you call that 230 volt shunt motor with a constant main field drives a load whose torque is proportional to the cube of the speed
our thumbs normally indicates superiority and there are certain gestures which are universally popular, particularly the thumbs up gesture
so just to summarize the whole process, i have a zl
what exactly does an instructional designer do or what exactly will you be doing when you design e content
so, keep it like this, what i have done i will open it again to show it to you what i have done you see red goes here black is common right and we insert it, right
every time there is going to be some disturbance, some speed coming down or going up due to some reason
so my question to you is suppose somebody starting out completely from clean slate not to pun on your product but clean slate, what would your you know experience say hey guys do not go that path, go this path this is what we have learned that is full of you know difficulties, this is something that we recommend you should be on, something like that for them, so this is from a practitioner point of view
so, you can easily find out your i 2 is minus 2 that is your what you call it will be 2 and i 1 is 0
let us see how i can interface this sensor
so, it is like movx at the rate dptr sorry movx at the rate dptr comma a or another option is the other way
so, we want to calculate the diode current, we want to calculate i when we have a forward bias v of 0
very very small miniaturized machine
and also, in the 1990s there was the development of the galvanic anodes which i would, i would concentrate quite a bit today, ok but i will talk a little bit about them
it can few points to be noted that static data member does not have cannot co exist with a non static member function
so by looking at the slack we can tell which of the nets are, which of the segments of the net list are critical in the sense that some of the slacks may become negative
so let us try to take a probably quick look at one of the machines maybe a dc machine
so, somehow i have to make vgs to be equal to this
so, once this is rotated, i am going to have a phase, b phase and c phase having induced emfs, which are time shifted from each other by 120 degrees
so this is what we call a feedback oscillator system
how do we find a solution for n greater than or equal to 4
for example, i give you the example of electronics industry in india
3 cosine of 2 pi into 0
so, let us now look at problem 5
so, first is the induction motor of the your what do you call input power of the induction motor efficiency is given 0
so, if we choose 5 as the frame size, then there will be many frame boundaries compared to when we choose 8 as the frame size
with the result that net flow through surfaces perpendicular to the x axis is going to be minus v x at x, y, z b c plus vx at x, y, z b c plus partial of v x y partial x a b and c, this is the change in v x through a, let me see if i do not that is early no i did not
9 volt and so on
try to make delta one and delta two approximately equal right
we have studied till now the forward converter and the flyback converter in the isolated class
when i add them vectorially i am going to get this as the total emf right, vectorially i have to had all the three emf at any instant of time, that will be the total emf
ok, so this creates a problem
if you have too much of a gap, it will never develop any arching action, right
so, the output should be 500, and then i construct a print job object
so i have a circuit under test, c u, t
so, let us do that; so, first is the spatial derivative
while well narration is used along with an image there is a balance in processing across the visual and the auditory channel, this prevents the visual channel from being overloaded
again, if you have a you have a division between rs and r1 parallel r2, you have to include that here minus the threshold voltage
so, that is that is what i said sometimes this this t max we call break down sometimes we call it as tbd that maximum torque sometimes we call tbd right that breakdown torque this one the maximum torque right
and if there are novel features of your invention, the features which you consider to be inventive, you would also tell the searcher that these are the inventive features
now when we have n type channel with the help of channel only the electrons can flow, if there is no channel how can electron flow from here to here not possible right not possible there is no channel right
of course, when a task gets generated, inserting in the queue is o1 because it gets inserted at the end of the queue
so i have just shown this diagram, just to give you this, this idea
so, this entire portion we will be removing
now, let us consider the mass spring friction system which is shown in the figure below
now from 4 kilohertz, we are sending to 3 kilo hertz, you see they are changing the 3 kilo hertz still it is working well
what about n the second term in the green bracket what does it look like
now, let us talk about a extending or a designing
so, in the other videos that we have looked at we have seen that there are several countermeasures that have been implemented in standard systems
so, i look forward to see you in the next class, right
we take out one task from the queue at a time and check which is the processor that is currently the most underutilized processor
now you have to keep in mind since we are talking about the dc voltage source it means that inductor will also be short circuited and capacitor will be open circuited
for that assume that at some moment the output i mean if the solution is here is at point b ok, at some moment say this is here, but then due to some disturbance due to whatever the reason is say the output v o changes a bit ok
so if is i apply control c here, i will be applying the reverse c bar here
now this 2 f0 also corresponds to the length pi f0 corresponds, as we know on a quarter wave is of length 572 electrical length and this corresponds to 3 pi upon 2
so it's very interesting for you to observe that in each of the panels the thick line that you see is the failure plane, is the failure line
it is easy to understand as to why this should be reference because if this were not a reference, then you will unnecessarily require a copy construction to happen and then the assignment will happen
and it is encountering minus terminal first minus 16 is equal to 0
so, at those points what will happen
first let you let us use a vertical
we are not using it
so, we don't know the charges but we know that repairs has been done and we are required to prepare a balance sheet on say 31st of march
so, you see here this circuit is given
there is a call instruction that you use to call a subroutine
so, as a trade off we either take linear time for delete max or linear time for insert
when that happens, then we lose the values of the formal parameters x and y
after constructing front view, we have to see it from top view
so, i have not put a minus sign over here previously we had a minus sign
but, if you have aluminum on which you want to grow oxide, then you cannot grow oxide at 1150 or 1200 degree centigrade, because the aluminum will melt
now you can solve it by putting this thing because 2 coils are there right
so, we will come down and this will look like this ok
this number of parts and each parts having a particular relation with each other forms a complete tractor here in this solidworks model
last statement we are going to prepare here is that is the budgeted balance sheet and with that we will be able to come to the end of the complete master budgeting process in this case or for this case
what do you have to do then
so in this way both the throw 1 and throw 2 are emulated using this power semiconductor device couplet
so, these could be atomic orbitals which come together to form molecular orbitals and each orbital can have 2 electrons of opposite spin
there is dominant gene that does not allow the expression of a particular trait, but then you also have selective demands that are put forward by the environmental conditions
it has a part a, it is it has a part where the contact information is mentioned, the technical information is mentioned, a part where the public disclosure and prior art is mentioned, and in some idfs you will find that, there is a market valuation and licensing also that is captured
this is what we talked about when we talked about electro mechanical energy conversion
this location originally had the return to main which we had seen and now we overflow a buffer and replace this return to main with this sequence of gadgets
these are all plus points of python
so, you can visit these websites and try to use some of them
so, you would make that estimate and provide the development length that is required, the lesser of the two estimates as what you would use
so, if you up cast there is no situation where you can get into an error situation because either you will be accessing the base part of the class which is just making limited access which is fine or you and the compiler will restrict you from using or accessing any part of the specialized class which actually does not exist
that is the also the average life span has increased now
we saw earlier that the effective mass is very close to the real mass
so, the point was that if i want to fabricate a mosfet then what is the technique, what are the process flow
i x is nothing but v 1 minus v 2 by 2, i 2 is nothing but v 2 minus v 3 by 8 and i 3 would be v 2 by 4
one, is you have the substrate; we have seen different kind of substrates
it looks at how taste can communicate different messages regarding our background, our preferences, our cultural background etcetera
so here, if you look at the main steps in the vlsi physical design cycle, so here i have listed some
this is going from v d d to zero
and also, like many semiconductor characteristics, these things are a strong functions of temperature
and, there is no merit in knowing this
there is no other option
so, priority one, if it is assigned to a task, each time the task arises, we insert it in the queue
and he gave longer list he said that the first stage is the stage of infancy that is the first year now this corresponds to the oral stage given by freud, but freud’s oral stage was 0 to 2 years where as erickson says that infancy basically is of only one year then erickson’s second stage is the early childhood stage which is 2 to 3 years and this corresponds with the anal stage that freud had proposed
so, if p is a person and s is a student then eat will work on p, interestingly it will also work on s and that is a basic property of public inheritance
but before working out the example, we look at how to compute the signal probability of the basic gates
it means that you can simply write r equivalent is nothing but reciprocal of the summation of the reciprocal of individual resistances, right
and then only i will go for it, i will make it on or off
the second is the semi fixed feature space
so, if for example, there is no there is there is scatter here and my boundaries over here
it takes the focus of this speaker and transfers it on to the listener
so, imagine that i have an integral epsilon to some constant a and i am integrating log of x dx and i am going to eventually take the limit epsilon tends to 0 ok
similarly i can do the same thing for h i will write it as half of h e to the j omega t plus h star e to the minus j omega t ok
so, this is with delta gap then you can say these results are not satisfactory, may be the magnetic frill is little bit more accurate as an input
so we have to connect it to ground for signal frequencies through a capacitor c3
so we will prepare the third cost sheet, third problem we will do, and then after that we will learn about how to analyze the cost sheet and how to arrive at the important decision making, which is the subject matter of management accounting
this cannot minimized; this will be i mean theoretically that r id square actually minimum power loss in the network
and our engineering drawing course teach you how to do this assembly things and also how to represent basic drawings
so, i 2 current is leading
there is a variety of other and other types of transistors all of them once you understand the model can be understood analyzed and designed using the principles you learn from this course okay so tomorrow let's say if someone invents a different technology you have a different type of transistor or a different type of amplifying device you should still be able to analyze circuits using them and also design circuits using them
first one was sam and now prince, ok
so, it is a phasor sum like vector vector sum you have to do it so v1 plus v2 plus v3 is equal to i into
so, the value of the determinant delta can be obtained by expanding along the first row
so, the 1996 wct extended the protection of copyright to two subject matters computer programs and data bases
so, each of this can take the value of logical 0 or logical 1, high or low
so, for that we pick m point pick om as radius identify the point on both the sides
tthis is the older version and i use personally like
then what happens, suppose this load is, this is zc
yes, we have been trying for successfully to do travel together for a few days in india and we went to bhutan
how, like say, for example, we deliberately introduce a delay out here
so, a close observation of figure 38 it reveals that v t is a multiplication of a ramp function and a gate function
that's why the title of income statement i have written here is if you look at the previous budgeted income statement of bkc for the quarter
so, this gives the total number of states per unit volume having energy less than e
and same way if you want to change the frequency, again press the white button, and you are back to the frequency mode, again you can change the frequency, excellent
so, in that case it will become 3 i 0 is equal to 30 because if you move like this it is minus 30 plus 3 i 0 is equal to 0 right that means, my i 0 is equal to say 10 ampere right
so, v out, v out whatever v out is there we will write it here, right
so, first you look into this diagram
similarly that is your ah your what you call in terms of i a plus i b plus i c, similarly if you write v b, v b is equal to v a minus i 2 z 2 right
first let us see the basic lc oscillator and the feedback network and let us see how it works
so, that was, so this is the way we move along the smith chart
now, as it turns out we are all electrical engineers and we like phasors and why do we like phasors
g plus j b is nothing but 1 upon z and z is nothing but r plus j x
on the other hand, supposing i said no i will start my search from let us say (6,6) supposing i have start from here where do was the gradients taking
i'll switch on the supply, i do not have any control, what do you think will happen not me alone, maybe 10 of us, huge weight okay
i do carry my diary with me most of the time and so i jot things down in points
now i shall try to explain this with the help of an example
for striping the photoresist
let us start let us take one step back let us start with the basis functions we will come to testing like, say let us start with the basis functions
so, as the name implies, we are trying to modify ah circuit netlist in some way and there are many ways in which you can do that
so, we do not know anything about true shape here, but just we know front view and top view of some object
under the assumption assuming that a bulb can be treated as a point source, i am taking this bulb to be a point sources which is radiating isotopic, radiating isotropically
so, that is about; so, these are the questions that we will work with ok
this tells us how we want to open the file
so integral h db gives me whatever is the area that is covered by this particular curve, right
let us look into the mbed c code
and lastly personalization because it is a person who is dealing with the entire thing if a machine is going to speak to them, you know you cannot have that connect
so what i am done in the same earlier example i have just commented out the two lines which we are making the member function display and the member function append of the list class as friends of the node class, instead i have made the whole list class as a friend
once you have exceeded that you have to bring it back past the re passivity potential which is lower than pitting potential and into this region here which is passivity
so, first one so y 1 i have right, so we can make it say ym no problem correct
yeah that is all absolutely nothing else ok, so this is the solution
now because we don't have access to both terminals, we can't obtain a current output from an op amp
so now signal flows through this path
so, its bit misleading the name if you want to them in lines you must make sure that you have each of them terminated by backslash n
so this is what i have said earlier
so per stamping, i will have only 20 flux lines, so when i look at d phi by dt obviously for every stamping, i am going to have reduced amount of voltage induced
it depends upon what kind of mechanism i have designed
so this height into this width is the area of this rectangle
so i can draw this as the short circuit characteristics, this is passing through this point
so, 38% was return in march 14
so, here what you did first case is study when i said you put the peripheral neurons first followed by schwann cells second, you can reverse the order you could have if this is one paradigm you are following there is another paradigm you can follow where you put the schwann cells first and you put the peripheral neurons second or you could have a third paradigm where you put the schwann cells and the peripheral neurons together
but, suppose i want to automate this process, i want to design my system in such a way that whenever the temperature falls below a certain level, let us say 25 degree centigrade, i should turn on the heater, if it is above i should turn off
so, in this case f is acting this way 1
they are not going to change, if i say that it is a 400 volts what i am getting in my laboratory from the grid it will be remain enlarge at 400 volts
then i am going to have essentially some reactive current is drawn from the stator side to make sure that the shortfall is actually taken care of, right
lets work out first
so, what do you think
so this attacks has been used very famously retrieve a secret keys from a victim process which is executing a cryptographic algorithm
most of us tend to unconscious the lock our ankles and feet whenever we are interacting with a person who is either senior to us or we find ourselves in a situation when we feel that we have to be rather on the defensive attitude
i think if the infrastructure in both the cases allows students to have the textbook also in this repository, be it a school repository or their own private one, then i think it is more easy for the students as well to refer their textbook and the shared content at the same place
so, again, what is the total collection for this is dollars, 66,100s
hospital can hire employee for it or can opt for outsourcing
now another thing is from the load flow studies you have studied, know that ah anywhere, that any bus power injection, p minus jq is equal to v conjugate i
for example, disciplines like engineering, robotics, as well as computer science are studying facial expressions
there is a risk of accidentally say making set equal to 1 and reset equal to 1; that means, i say there is a chance of pressing set and reset simultaneously which is not allowed ok
and c++ has operators which can do casting at the static time or at the dynamic time
so, let us formally the huygens principle and extinction theorem
this is a scenario where here i am ignoring the delay of this inverter, so i am assuming c one and c two are getting activated almost simultaneously, zero to one of c one and one to zero of c two are happing together
this output resistance, has a typical value of 75 ohms or less
now, when the process one the green process executes the ssl encryption, as we know that there would be a certain number of cache misses that occurs, and as a result there will be parts of the instruction and data corresponding to this ssl encryption, which gets loaded into the cache memory
so, which way is my poynting vector
this is the most general possible way of representing it because it is i mean square integrable signal that i have ok
so, here therefore, i can definitely write the output will be k times v 2 minus 0 which is same as k times v 2 or v 2 is same as vp
this is the determinant delta, now for delta 1 delta 2 delta 3 what you will do, right
here we have that modulated signal passing through a multiplier, the other end of the multiplier is connected to an lo signal which produces 2 signals which are 90¡ phase shifted and this in turn when multiplied lead to and pass through a lowpass filter produced the i and q signals back
so this is actually mentioned here that for a c mos dynamics gate switching takes place either zero to two times for an average of alpha equal to half, because two times per cycle means alpha equal to one
so, what was what was the fem procedure to get a system of equations take one one t
i can even write q outside, one over x square plus y square plus z minus z, naught square square root minus, and that's due to image one over square root of x square plus y square plus z plus z, naught whole square
so, given that a let us try to see how the operator will get deigned
the given link can also be further exist in order to listen to the complete video i am showing only certain excerpts from the complete one
so there are two context switches for every task arrival
and then when you sought to talk with some voice of authority, and we found that it took us about 10 or 15 years to establish that credibility
it is quite easy to install
whether generation is the problem or whether the transmission is a problem
in the previous lecture, for every vector field we defined a quantity called the divergence
they create an illusion of social and cultural affiliation and stability
so, fund is a amount of profit generated but it's not cash
if these are roads the constraint that we have is that one can only travel up or right
this is known as the threshold voltage
so, 15 into 30 by 15 plus 30; so equivalent to 10 ohm and power delivered is you know v square upon rab because equivalent this is actually rab equivalent resistance, because this terminal is a this terminal is b
so, now let's prepare the income statement
sectional area is bounded by a visible outline
society education is all meant to create people with the same thought process, when i am saying same, not in the narrow sense within the range of where we are
and what we are drawing is of course i versus lambda, now i have completely switched to lambda i am not writing phi because i am multiplying that by number of turns all the time, right
so with respect to vlsi design, i needs some additional space through which i can inter connect the blocks
but in the real sense that amount has no value or no use because you cannot use that $25,000 for making any kind of payments
pick this one the lines by holding control button
ok, we have back again
now, from investor angle, it seeks to find out what percentage of return does the dividend give
i define the operating point as v10, v2 and which give rise to currents i 10 and i 20
in our circuit vgs is fixed and we thought that vt was 1 volt for our transistor
however, as it picks up speed the you are conductor will cut less rapidly because relative speed will go down right
however s21 represented by square represented by this red line and s 41 square represented by this dotted line will vary
so, you have to do this calculation beforehand because once you coded up your update equations your alpha is fixed
now, naturally as i have mentioned that when we do this instantiation
this is equation number one
and as before, obviously if you satisfy that, you will automatically satisfy that one
the cutoff or corner frequency of low filter is higher than the cutoff frequency of high pass filter and the difference between this frequency; that means, if i draw right the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter and the cutoff frequency of high pass filter write the difference between it; that means, this is the difference that is the band which will be allowed to pass
this is your tangential velocity right, n is given speed in r p s revolution per second, b is the breadth of the loop in metre i told you, l is the length of the one side of the loop in metre and b is equal to flux density in tesla or weber per metre square right
so, the linking of optics and electromagnetics was made possible by maxwell
so, we then need to fill this system with the appropriate level and position of the electrons
select the circular surface and the surface it has to be tangent upon, and we will click ok, selecting tangent, we click ok here or either in the mini toolbox, finish
so, some quite famous tools which we have used is this rop gadget and ropper
so in this way we can get overlapped execution
so, the test is one where you have the graded difficulty level and therefore, how much time you take and how accurate you are these are the two indicators based on which the final assessment is made
you get this term nothing but the state transition matrix and then you get x at time t is equal to 0, so you get phi t x0 plus the inverse laplace transform of this component
now what happens when we talk about corrosion in concrete structure, so we will see you know first we will look at what is that service life or how we define service life usually
we looked at a simple model, where we had a solid as a uniform three dimensional box with no potential
to close, how do you then go about carrying out your verification
so, you can ask one question now why do we need yet another method
so, that is why it is one into dt plus in between the and when t greater than one it is 3 t square a
so that is called multi section, that kind of structure is referred to as a multi section impedance matching circuit or a multi section broad band matching circuit, which we shall cover in the next module
we will see quickly, how we can derive this integrator and differentiator, and then we will perform several experiments and see when we apply different input signals, what are the output signals corresponding to those input signals
so this is an example of a single priority inversion and the time for which the task t1 gets blocked is between t3 and t4, where the task t3 completes users of its critical resource
array is a collection of data items
that is the definition
why ssc is a straight line and occ is non linear
on the basis of his studies he has suggested that countries of southern europe as well as arabic countries can be termed as being contact cultures because in these societies normally he found that people are prone to touching each other and at the same time they maintain closer interpersonal contact in dyadic and team situations
so the condition is your: this width of the pulse, t w must be equal to maximum of flip flop propagation delay maximum of this logic circuit, delay this order i am saying plus setup of time
so, we have both donors and acceptors, but if the concentration of donors is more than acceptors material is set to be over all n type material
so, this is the starting torque value
let us see there is a major flood in the factory and because of flood your stocks are damaged, your machinery is damaged, you will have to incur a lot of repairs after the flood to restore your machinery and make your factory in proper order so the loss of stock damage to the machinery and repairing costs all this taken together if the amount is significant keep in mind i am talking of major flood normal hirsar ttod a toda bhaud a little flood a then it is not an exceptional item
so, when these estimates come i some of the reports have read and i am sure when they are talking about depression, they are talking of depression as per the criteria given in
in the monochronic cultures we find that time is divided and further subdivided into identifiable units; however, in polychronic cultures we find that time is a happy mixture of past present and future and these segments are not strictly segregated
so, i ab will be this one, 4
the direction of yeah the
calculate the gain observed in the table and compare it with the theoretical gain
so if you put it in top of b, for example, the gap between the floor and ceiling will be this gap two
so, it may happen normal line energizing or de energizing; this is what happen and high speed; different type of switchings are there
so you see that your loss increases very rapidly, and this delay becomes very costly for the financial viability of a product
in the lab sessions you saw couple of demonstrations, for instance you saw muller lyer illusion
we move to the second row and we try to put a queen in the first available column this is the third one and this in turn will attack another set of rows, columns and diagonal squares
so, an obvious improvement is to just directly scan the numbers from 1 to the larger of m and n and in one scan compute list fm and fn
10 electron volts, e g for germanium is around 0
so there are some function definitions
so, this is actually d 2 minus d 1 that is h, d 2 minus d 1
so, this is due to air friction and then we will talk about eddy current damping
3 db point right we have already seen what is 3 db or what that is where the voltage drops about 0
now initially what happens that there are certain vaguely reinforced type of behavior which is given to some persons, say for instance if you are parents, if you are care givers they where vaguely reinforcing your behavior according to what they thought you should be
that seems to be an important question right because if you choose the wrong dl, if you choose it to be two coarse then you are not a you are not representing the fields correctly its two course
we will get it at means we will be requiring it certainly, so if it is available at uhhh half the price find to buy it
so, this is the current i 0 which is for r x equal to 0 and this is also same as i can write this is also same as i fsd of the meter full scale read current of this meter
now, let us go for the start developing little bit more on it we know that the casting can be implicit or it could be explicit
now, let us look at revolved sections
so because of this dilemma, typically this process are integrated as much as possible
so, along the x direction, you calculate the x mean
so; that means, you have to do not, do not add the magnitude you have to consider this phase the thirty 8
if in the balance sheet we continue to show 20,000, it will be a wrong representation
so let us summaries also this: what do i have
now, we can also consume a file, we are typically dealing with text files
5 second and i infinity i showed you that it is 3 ampere how to get it this 3 ampere right
so, 2 equations we got and you can solve using 2 equation v a and v b; hope i have not missed anything and there is no current flowing here because this is open
i know which squares are there and the possible range of values is from minus 7 to plus 7 minus n minus 1 to plus n minus 1 and for the other direction it is from 0 to 2 times n minus 1 in our case two times n minus 1 is two times 7 which is 14
and then we have a load resistance rl and this rl must appear across drain source
there is a bin folder and a symbols folder
so, remember here what is done is the bank balance is increasing and the cash balance is decreasing
so, what will happen is if we follow the your what we call the this v a n, then v b n, it is moving it is say moving like these anti clockwise direction right
so, this will no longer act as an amplifier like the way we are expecting
we can do that also, that is another way, concentric coil, we call them as concentric coils
this gate output maybe going to more than one place
if the current direction is counter clockwise, a would be coming out
so, equation 1; equation 1, 2 and equation 3, you have to solve, if you make it in matrix form and solve any way clammer’s rule and anyway you want, right
so, ammeter reading will be close to i sc when this factor is close to 1
so, it means in this case you can say that we have the sales level is 7,000 units and our selling price is 31 but if you calculate the total cost here, the total cost becomes is $221 against the total sales value of the $217,000
so, the result as it is stated is that we consider for a given task set all tasks become ready at time zero and we just need to check whether they meet their fast deadlines
so, first what you do we apply kcl at node 1
i know h as numbers i do not know it as
now we also said that, each energy state can take 2 electrons right you can have a electron which spin up and spin down
so, i will not need to bother about initializing this top marker
the psychological underpinning can be very easily be understood out of it
now you know, what are passive filters
and this is i 2 is leaving i 1 is also leaving
so, when you integrate this for constant i mean over you will get 4 pi r square which is a surface area right
so, still looking at this it is seem even more confusing when we first started out right, but it is a few steps that we have to take
i wonder if that is the truth but that’s what he told me, so i will take it at face value
so, what we got we got the voltage relationship as well as resistance relationship for resistance relationship we try to find out the equivalent resistance across the terminals and for the current and voltage source relationship we just saw, when we short circuit a and b what would be the value of the current flowing through the short circuited terminal
so, we were talking about possible modeling approaches and one of the more popular and appropriate approaches for modeling and analysis, particularly seismic analysis of masonry constructions is what is referred to as equivalent frame modeling where the masonry construction is considered as an equivalent frame
now you have got your e and h has come out as a result of a calculation and someone says now give me the actual quantity in lab, the physical electric field in lab, what would you do
so, this criterion typically will always tell you that it is the section that is most compressed because of the maximum moment occurring at the bottom of the wall is where the failure is expected to occur
so these are particulars, january, february and march
now when we are going through this assembly we have to click on this assembly and ok
so, as for this concept, it is not prudent to count unrealized gain but it is desired to guard for all possible losses
so, one budget goes wrong, second will do well, third will do well, ultimately the annual results can be improved
we were more concerned about the functional correctness of the circuit, whether the circuit is working correctly or not, and main you can say component where the most significant amount of delays took place during that period
these are the 2 cases that we have to worry about
so, these are sensors which are called energy dispersive x ray analysis
this is also called as deadlocked avoidance inversion or ceiling related inversion, etc
so, when it comes to these two sets of edges 2 and 3 what kind of coefficients will they be
the displacement of the mass can be measured using capacitive sensing or piezoelectric effect sensing
one will be better vector right
no, it is penetrating of course, its penetrating its dielectric object, it has some permittivity
now if we further analyze the smith chart, this is basically how we had gone in the previous class
so, it is written here very low voltage supply and this is v s c
welcome to part 2 of module 12 of programming in c++
you can see here now i have included two years figures though for calculation you will know only one year figure the prior years figures are also given because you can start comparing and start understanding the trend
so, you can see that there is something very interesting happening here, we had seen that earlier also we had seen; that lets say if i just take an example of different kinds of data members
but this gives you like we would use a pm interaction for a problem of bending compression in rc design
then i get into this particular scope, where i construct two more objects and then i see what is the value of the jobs, and the number of pages jobs will become 3, because two more print jobs are on, and the number of pages go down by 30 and 20 further
the magnetising current is reactive in nature and the core loss component of current is real and because core loss component of current is very very small, invariably the power factor will be pretty bad for a transformer under no load condition
so, n c and n v are known, we can calculate n i
and process a and process b are colluding with each other so that data and information from one process is transmitted to the other process in spite of all the security aspects offered by the operating system as well as the microprocessor
i can now use this equation 1 that i have written over here right
either we go to the next shop or we replace that product with the other product
so, expression for energy transferred is given by it is given in between time t is equal to 0 to t is equal to infinity
this is something, which we are all familiar with that i call a function and i expect that function to return a value and that value will denote whether the function has successfully completed or there is an error, so this is by return value mechanism
a and hb, which are the total shear forces, in the first case, direct shear force minus h
if we specified that a is 72 bytes, then this is the smallest length of the string which would create a segmentation fault, so let us see this happening
so, before going into the state transition matrix, let us first understand how you will create the state and output equations from the state diagram
but if you do return by reference, then again we can avoid copying of large structures if that is what we want to return
this is the vertical plane, this is the horizontal plane, and what we have is cylinder resting on horizontal plane
now, what is the earliest i can hit this blue line is at this point; so, this point over here it satisfies the data equation because it is on the blue line and it of all possible solutions it is that which has the minimum 1 norm right
now we know that class c fly ash, again going back to isothermal calorimetry, we found that when we added the gypsum, the shoulder peak disappear, right
voice has to be first worked on at a physical level to unleash it is full natural potential
here is where i am actually applying the value v1 that is the stator voltage applied per phase
subsequently, d is constructed
so, it will be minus sign right this is your real part and this is your imaginary part this is core loss component current and this is your imaginary sorry magnetizing your called the imaginary part in the magnetizing component of the current
so i am calculating field ah, the potential at y, y minus y prime square
so, we have seen that the logic has been to stagger all of these 3 variables by how much half a grid we should not all be at the same point in space they should be staggered; that was one consideration
and again i can write this quantity in the green enclosure as phi unit vector for r less than equal to r
so, why was said that psychologist suddenly decided that the number of items in individual personality assessment tools should reduced
now, let us go to 3d ok, what we did was in a 1d case, where there was only one h z, but in general there will be sorry one k z right that is the wave in one direction, but in general there can be a k x, k y, k z right this is a wave in 3d ok
these two calculations have been done under that approximation and we want to understand when we can apply this
the next thing we actually look at is the address of user string
you can see almost 19 plus 402 more or less you are going to get this amount
2 tesla, but there are cores, high frequency cores like powdered iron, amorphous course with brand name metclass
so, the provisional specification will get you the priority, but provided you follow it up by filing a complete specification within 12 months
so in that scenario if you are doing the study for appliances, how you will analyze the circuit
so, when load is actually not connected so, what will happen is very small current right will flow through this your what you call through this primary side of the winding
if it will become f of r prime right so, i will get the rhs of equation 1 almost, but the left hand side does not look like l applied to something, its f multiplied by l acting on something
if the phase sequence had been different very clearly i am going to have this rotating in this direction whereas this rotating in the opposite direction, that is what it means by phase sequence are different as simple as that, are you getting my point
so, if i is one then case one will be selected by which x will become 6 and we have a default case which is executed, if the value of i does not fall among the different cases that exist
so the theoretical basis of such a test comes from an understanding of the failure as tau, the failure stress in shear as a combination of cohesion plus mu sigma
so, you can easily calculate the value of current i for capacitor
i'll let you think about how would you solve this problem using the bound currents, because, remember, bound currents, j b, which is equal to curl of m, is zero in this case, and k b, which is m cross n, is going to be equal to the surface current
so if you look at the sketch below, this is a sort of a guideline that helps us establish what is the height of the resisting peer
performance evaluation using the flexible budgets
5 by 60, right
so, by see 2017 to 2027 next 10 years how many users will be there, based on that you have to assign out here in these incubators who will be using how many shelves because these are costly when you are getting a co 2 incubator it causes a fortune
as we all know that it does matter for addition has to what type of data you are using because if i am adding two integers, i have one kind of addition
we have 4 incident and reflected waves, so we have 4 nodes this way, b2 and a2
now what i have shown you
and now we take the 0th position we get a value, we get the value 1 we do not get a list1
so, good point
so, we can we can we can write that your this cos omega t is sin 90 degree minus omega t, but one minus sin is here; that means, it will be im by omega c sin omega t minus 90 degree; that means, here your what we call that current i is equal to im sin omega t right and v voltage across the capacitor v actually it isim by omega c sin omega t minus 90 degree; that means, current actually is leading because it is omega t plus 0 and leading this voltage v is equal to vc and voltage across the capacitor
so let say that the a input is like this: b is the same
this means either this slope is zero, that means there's no velocity for the midpoint there, the point at the connecting point or velocities are the same
for example, let us take a pen and that is going to touch this point
for last two decades or so, the embedded applications have really increased to a great extent
so you are not going to really provide any electricity at all to start even the magnetization
we saw that read, readline and readlines, using this we can read the entire file in one shot of the string or read it line by line
on one side you are controlling this from your arduino board, vcc, ground, and through a digital port pin you are controlling the relay
so, now, we know that enhancement type mosfet, your current id is k times v g s minus v t whole square
so, it depends upon how i have really set the limit depending upon my commutator action, the commutator, the conductors, the i square r losses in the conductor for a short while should be in a position to withstand, i mean the machine should be in a position to withstand these
today i am going to talk, explain about how to do tension test for prestressing strands
now the primary induced emf e1 is in phase opposition to v1 / lenz’s law and is shown180 degree out of phase with v1
if we are interested about 360 degrees, we go with 360 degrees
it does overcome the unbounded priority inversion problem which is a severe problem can cause tasks to miss their deadline
so, one thing to note is that the written address which should be pushed onto the stack if the call function in main is this
these load deflection curves will actually be able to tell you how much the strength in compression of the element is going to be different from the compressive strength of the material itself
now, ideally what we see when we take any device or if we measure the noise power, then there are various kinds of noise power
how much of so2 is coming
so, find out 1 another 1 to get that subtract from 2
so, in this case, what will happen that you have completely you are what we called demagnetize that ferromagnetic material, so that means, it is starting from 0
whereas when you have vertical extensions of existing buildings, then you would have to check quantitatively the adequacy of the existing structural system for the new loads that you are going to design the structure for
so, these are these this is the sort of reasoning behind equivalence principles, the volume equivalence we saw that the object was replaced by volume current j and ms we saw
so, tan theta is equal to x by r this one you can write sin theta upon x is equal to cos theta upon r is equal to 1 upon root over r square plus x square right
so, if i now go to take the curl of this expression, you can sort of see what coordinate system will i use
so a bar, b, bar, c or a bar, b c bar, or a b bar, c bar or a b c
so, now v o will decrease, v o will decrease means what now i will come back in the opposite direction and i will come back to point c
so, range produces something which is a sequence of values which can be used in context like a 'for', but technically the range is not a list, we cannot manipulate the output of range the way we manipulate the list
so that means, the network is actually not drawing that your that whatever compensating you are putting network actually not drawing any reactive power from the source
the first one is maybe it is easy to construct a glass door kind of thing, then if we are trying to project on to this glass doors box method, this entire thing projects onto this views
so, to an extent the profit will be understated and we will ensure that because of any uncertain gain the profit is not overstated
so, you can calculate the per unit cost for some particular value of n; well i leave it as an exercise for you
is the power here you can see the how much ampere the boat is drawing alright
so that is a very critical
and that's the reason a frame size should be larger than the largest task execution time
there are two operations associated with the priority queue, one is delete max
as human beings we have a complex temporal identity, which is constructed at different levels at personal as well as social, cultural and professional levels
ok, so result become more complex
in an isometric projection of a cube, the faces of the cube and any planes parallel to them are called isometric planes
it turns out that if you look at the physical plan view of the most transistor, there is a certain length, this side is the source, this side is the drain and there is a certain width
if he rates at which the intensity is decreasing and increasing is slow that means i have almost matched omega 1 and omega 2 very very well
but if c is one, then x is coming to y
and i quote, “it is important at this stage to a step back from this specific debate and examine facial expressions in a broader context”
that is the total input reflection coefficient and output reflection coefficient will always be zero
as i just discussed with you, we prepare the budgets and special reports
sometimes while doing that, integral people get confuse, so let me just do that
for a short while i may allow my machine to carry twice the rated armature current
now at the end of execution of string copy when this particular function copier tries to return it picks the return address from the expected location on the stack that what it would obtain is this value 41414141 and during their ret instruction that copier executes it tries to change the instruction pointer to this location
only two factors have contributed and these two factors are, means beyond the control, uncontrollable factors, whether it is the machine breakdown or whether it is the labor rate, it is not in the control of anybody and the difference is expected to be there
now we we have another component; we have a diode
i am not going to be able to pull the rotor right
let us construct one more point here on bc, here let us construct one more point here also we can really construct another 1
now, what we are saying is that this particular terminal will be similar to this terminal because of the concept of virtual ground; this is what the circuit is
we know how we can grow silicon dioxide, we know how we can deposit a metal, we know how we can do lithography, we know how a mosfet is fabricated, we can fabricate n channel, we can fabricate a p channel, we know the depletion mosfet
i can always save my drawing like save
so, generally i am going to have definitely, you know a problem of starting in the synchronous machine, especially when it is working as a motor unless i kind of bring it very close to the synchronous speed and then allow it to lock up
so, i will need to give a call to this member function
so, we can just look up fibonacci of 3 and say oh, it is two
l’hopital’s rule right
and as it tries to lock r1, r1 is already locked by t1 and that's the deadlock situation
in the previous problem where we had the line charge we just took them discretize phi 1 integrated and got the solution
so, intersection point is o through which we have to construct a circle
it has been supported by allan pease also who has commented that, in his more than three decades of interviewing and selling two people, it has been noted that when it interviewing locks his ankle he is mentally biting his lips
we first looked at a metal metal junction, so we have 2 metals a and b with work functions φa and φb
material mixed variance this is a fourth variance mmv
now the pull out test is over, we have observed strand rupture at the bottom because when we test this 1 m long pull out specimen, the load resistance to the slip will also increase
how will you do it
next step; step 2 we discuss this previously what do i do next
and then again across resistive element v¬5 ¬it is voltage drop so we will say as positive v¬5¬
so, i am giving input v 2 here and so, therefore, some current will flow and it will flow like this, it will start from here and will go to ground, no current can go through this input that is rule number 2 right
when the switch is off, v 0 is 0, and this way there is no dissipation in the switch either when it is on during conduction or when it is off to go open circuit situation
and in terms of usage, the static data members are nothing other than they behave exactly like the global variables
rights may express itself, inherently in a human being like what we say about human rights, your right to vote, your right to be, your right to privacy these are things which are inherent in a human being
so, where the refractive index begins to depend on high over powers of electric field then you call that a nonlinear medium ok
so you can imagine as though it is extending into the board, so it is essentially going inside the board and we are going to have, essentially if it is an electromagnet we will have conductors here
so, what is the actual value that you choose for c1
but then the cr1 is also sometimes used by a high priority task with priority 10
then, you have backend insulators between metal layers and masking oxides
so, i will where the current is flowing that is going to be the place where i will do testing, i will get the singularity in green's functions i will deal with it not a problem
then we saw the advantages and disadvantages of monolithic integrated circuit technology
so, we also saw that there were 2 types of dopants; one was your n type, the other was the p type
so, the area which is dark shaded, this area, this one, they will be weak this areas would be weak and the areas which are not exposed will be strong, easy
you still would have to provide minimum horizontal and vertical steel as per the wall category a, b, c that we have seen earlier
if, that is the case what we have to do project that onto horizontal plane
now we will check so checking also we can see that shear stress is coming shear force divided by cross sectional area 270 by 6 so this is becoming 38
now, i am going to have the cage rotor sitting here
let us say, i solve these equations; once i solve these equations, how will i find the field everywhere
so, if we have 3 non touching loops, we will have 3 terms within this bracket
i am ah directly writing the vector potential for this ah spinning sphere
ok, fine, so lets look at the different levels of abstraction and see how, in what this represents behavioral representation, as i said, this specifies how ah design should behave, how it should respond to a given set of inputs, without specifying or telling how they are implemented to just tell that i want this
we always remain prepared and budgeting always helps us that what is going to happen at the end of a particular period
so the total number of possiblities will be three into three
it has got the processing capability already, but now for sending the data or storing the data in some server or in some database, we need some communication capability as well
the sensor should be able to respond to lpg gas fumes, there has to be some kind of a sensor in that way
so, we can write sin 90 degree minus omega t and this minus sign is here this minus sign is here you take minus sign inside that then what we will get that e1 = your n1 then ∅ m then omega right then you can write sin omega t minus 90 degree
so, if the switch position ah sorry if the switch position is like this then it is short circuit right
so, the interpreter always starts at the beginning of you of python code and reads from top to bottom
so the output is supposed to be one
for bob it is normal to quickly change appointment schedules and not meet deadlines this behavior is common in latin american and middle eastern countries
the boolean difference with respect to one of the variables, let say x, i is defined as follows: we denoted as the differential notation d, f, d, x, i
so it's a dependent source or a controlled source
so this is shown in this diagram, exactly what you have worked out
so, we can only remove from a stack the element that we last added to it
your audio is playing the text is so big on screen on one side the text is in a lower font, one side it is on the higher font, everything is playing together
now, in this figure position a is the position of the switch for a long time
so you need to be able to make an estimate from the geometry of the distribution of stresses and the geometry of the wall what the resultant forces c1, c2, c3 and c4 are for which you basically making use of the triangular distribution of compressive stresses in the wall
so, the second question by knowing projections and constructing the true length is always be slight complication involved, compared to the case where we know the true length and inclination angles made by that so, that we can construct projections
this is the labor efficiency variance or the lev
his methods today cannot be considered ethical; however, it was his findings which created more on ease and is still researchers go back to these findings
the input by bias current at the non inverting terminal minus input bias current at the inverting terminal
now, what we have to do, we have to find the transfer function of this system and its impulse response
so, that is a vector of unit length pointing in which direction
so, assuming that no losses therefore, we can make v1 / n1 = v2 / n2
so, all it means is that the second port must respond strongly to the first port and all other responses must be very small
so, that is why for 0 ampere it is like this t less than 0 and it is i x t minus 20 upon 3 this we got
because, sometimes our understanding of the technical content may vary from what the sme things and they are the final word because, we only understand design, technical stuff, accuracy your sme will tell you
the most important form is the invention disclosure form the idf comprises of a set of questions required by inventors to answer with a view to capture the following the description of the invention its normal and inventive aspects name and address of the inventor
the value that is returned must be a copy of the original, because the original object is going to change as soon as you return from this operator
so, recall that a slice takes a list and returns us a sub list from one position to another position
for example, in video conferencing haptics was absent, proxemics was also absent
in the multiple of thousands
suppose, for example, i am making it for you
that can lead to a different state of stress in the block in the masonry prism itself
in case if we have a view is from left side direction to right side direction the opaque plane will be that
now, we want to compute the list of common factors
so now, we go to 90 hertz, and i see it is still not allowing to pass
it says that several rows of horizontal wires, for both vdd and ground, run parallel to each other on metal layer
one is the standard your or straight run or intermediate tower, another one the angle or anchor or tension tower
actually it was expected to be 2
now, the ammeter reading gives an indication of this current right that is what we know, but let us see where does the error come from ok
so, you would find that the eyes would shut automatically for two or three seconds are even longer and this sight remains closed as a person wants to remove you momentarily from his mind we can understand that it is a negative gaze
so, to draw a diagram like this is slightly misleading because what is it mean to show in infinite i mean, the value of the delta function is infinity at that point
in the third case, the flag is 3
if it is 1 is to 1 transformer, i am talking about 1 is to 1 transformer
and there the mixing is especially important as i will say later
now, we know this formula that v t is equal to v infinity plus v 0 minus v infinity e to the power minus t upon tau
but, across that the phase what you call line to line voltage across this load, this is v l angle 0 degree, and this is say b to c it is v l angle minus 120 degree
so like in this cathodic protection also people think that some of the codes which, existing codes they were originally made for steel structures or structures without concrete, you know or metallic structures
now the tem wave solution for this parallel waveguide is given like this
so, there was no cracking, no sign of shrinkage cracking, right
now we could investigate a little bit in detail and see what actually is happening
this is the overall structure
after that project r 1 all the way up to locate r 1', and then join p' r 1' in that way, and this represents true length of the line p and r
first let's answer this question that do rma and the dma, rate monotonic algorithm and the deadline monotonic algorithm, both of them do they produce identical schedule under some situations
now, all these things we have already discussed in the previous weeks that cost depends on how many number of units you are actually manufacturing
so let me write these two expressions once again
so in today’s session we will discuss about the magnetically coupled circuit
we have seen a silicon wafer which are single side polished, we can also have silicon wafer which a double side polished
and for star star line current is equal to phase current right
i have 2 pi into fc, which is my 1 kilo hertz, into my r , which is 10 kilo ohm, then i will have value which is 5015 nano farad, approximately 15 point
let say this is the distance d between the two blocks b one and b two
but if it is a comfort and if it is a luxury, for example now you talk about these days you can say color tvs
they can be upwards or downwards
infinite happiness and peace is possible from the taking care of others or all well being because if we only try to get happiness keeping others unhappy that won't be a shashvati suhkham because at some or other point of time we get hit so here the message is that for a shashvath suq or for an infinite happiness, we have to take care of others also
eye contact is often linked with the trust issue because as a society we have been taught right from the childhood that someone who looks away during the conversation, while answering a question is not a person whom we can trust easily
of course, for this stack template to work we will need the type t, the type variable t to satisfy certain property certain traits
maybe her costume has moved around in the traffic, she has to stop at several places to make sure she is okay because she is riding to work
is the input lower the lower trigger point
the trouble will happen when these quantities begin to well we know that green’s functions have a singularity at the origin; origin in this case means when r is equal to r prime
first one was very simple that we only calculated the three variances from a very, means a single input and the single output
tthat is what we discussed
earlier what was the cost
ah, maybe i should just put in this way so that you see, actually see a chip which is here and that chip is essentially interfaced to this little p c b
s tends to 0 means t tends to infinity
so, you have a gauss lengedre quadrature rule which is accurate to order 2 n minus 1 right
if we have a source then some part of the power, incident power from the source will be reflected back and some part of the power will enter the network, this network
now we come back to the old question that whether a particular aptitude can be attributed know that it is a basically product of heredity or do we say that it is basically a product of the environment
so, if you right 60 i1, then your minus 30 i 2 is equal to v oc right
i will be able to make the rotor catch up with the stator reporting magnetic fields speed
the other way of looking at this lofter surfaces for example, we have one particular curve it is a closed curve on one side
because we want to make our overall management decision making process very very effective
so, that is why and if you want that what will be reflected wave something i have made it for you for this one v f plus v b is equal to v
so, e y on the left and e y on the right and subtract these two, but what i do is d e y by dx i am going to take the average over 2 time instance; 2 time instances
so, 500 to 750, you have to raise the speed, what resistance should be inserted in
similarly, a a dash, b b dash and c c dash basically physically they are 120 degree apart right
and suppose we have an active device like this
and v ca is equal to root 3 v p angle minus 210 degree that is v l angle minus 210 degree
if that memory has been null, the pointer has been null even then the delete will work safely
what it also means is, if charge q1 is doubled force due to q1 also gets doubled
it just like a television serial which is broken into several episodes
now, this entire thing, we would like to extrude it in 3 dimensions
so, for side view, we are looking from this direction from left to right we are observing it
now, join p point and n point
beyond the peak, you to look at the descending branch that is the resistance of the material starts decreasing and you cannot have a force control test anymore because you cannot reduce the applied force the system is not going to respond
because when we using 0 x 2 because, we decided these points by the more of the function, because something looks like a trapezoidal then we have to take that section
if i am talking about a 500 kilo watt machine or 850 kilo watt machine like what we use in traction it will be impossible to withstand that kind of a noise
this is actually 6, this is 6 right and this side is 1 and this side is 1, this similarly this side and this side identical right, this side and this side identical and this side 4 plus 1 and your 4 plus your what to call from here to here, it is 1 you get here 1 right, this side it is there yours 4 your what you call this from here to here it is 6 and here it is 1, here it is 1 right
lets call this p one, because i am going to go step by step
let us draw the picture of a simple ah thermopile, which is essentially a set of series connected ah, i r, ah thermocouples
assume you have done all these
so you will get the total value of current i t is nothing but i s plus natural response of the circuit in case of overdamped, again i s plus critically damped response of the circuit when source is not available and plus in case of underdamped we get i s plus the natural response of underdamped circuit
another aspect that definitely has a role to play is how slender the wall is
so, we will be discussing about financial statement analysis
gds was originally zero
so all that galvanic anodes will do, if you use galvanic anodes within the patch repair is prevent that problem
so, after developing photoresist i will have patterns like this
if you substitute here some k 1 into i a therefore, k dash upon k 1 we are calling as k double dash right something like this
now, you can also say that the port is nothing but an access to a network and consists of a pair of terminal, the current entering one terminal leaves through the other terminal so that the current entering the port will be equal to zero
now, if you see this particular circuit, let us assume that the voltage at this particular node is v naught, so what we will do
so this second term is zero, is equal to energy flowing in from joule heating
now you have this
now, we have the 6 different parts for this single cylinder engine
so if you are doing a gate level timing analysis, there can be some problems
third quarter, october end, there was a loss of more than 600 million, which was extremely surprising
we call them viscous friction, static friction and coulomb friction
now, these separate winding or coils which you see as a a dash, b b dash, c c dash in the figure
so, the actuators that you see at the top, the jacks that you see at the top are actually subjecting the wall to a desired level of pre compression
so, theoretically you can theoretical you can
and, then average this will be a by pi by 2 it was for this full wave rectified waveform and now, in this case we see that half of the times the waveform is absent like here it was present here it is absent
repairs and renewals and if you talk about the repairs and renewals number one is the factory plant
and this is based on displacement of a small mass that is etched into the silicon surface of the ic, and suspended by small beams
but, there will also be a potential within the material because, of the seeback effect
then the constructor will get invoked implicitly by instantiation and there are two syntax typically that can be used for it
similarly, for lname
okay so, in yesterday’s class we actually said that when we draw the equivalent circuit of a transformer, we are going to first of all consider the resistance of the primary winding, then the leakage reactance of the primary winding as well
lets say i have a circuits
first of all to do that, we have to decide which direction gives us maximum dimensions and minimal hidden lines; that we will pick it as front view in this direction, this is the front view direction
37 that means it is safe the joint is safe under that much stress shear force now we will see another one the connection of flange plate to flange cover that means this one connection of flange plate to i am sorry this one connection of flange plate to flange cover so we have to join this means 2 weld again has been provided so we have to see whether this safe or not so it will be connection of flange plate to cover plate so if we see this in this case the summation of te will be same 9
so, for non reheat turbine f hp is 1
7 kelvin
so, third case is applicable in this case and now we will calculate this material mix various
and this is exactly what you want, because here in this case, v0 is smaller than what is required, so it will be increased
so invariably, when we use some high frequency transformer, the core will be made up of some amorphous iron or powdered iron material
hold time is the minimum time the data must be kept stable after the clock edge comes right
so i should say, it is encountering the current once here, once here, once here, once here and one more time here
now, this we have already discussed, for example, here is a open stub, you saw that in the previous module we had discussed that the same stub can act as as a inductor or as a capacitor depending on the length or the frequency
so, what is what kind of an object is that
because this is the slip expression for maximum we got
for example, i would like to make a turning operation where a cylinder of 20 mm i would like to make
give a glimpse of the overload resolution
which balances the terminal voltage under the assumption that the stator resistance and leakage reactance's are negligible right
and this is given by the value at a particular time t divided by the minority carrier lifetime τ
so, whenever you show in exam or in your class or in your interview, if it is asked, please plot everything correctly
you can refer to this book, and you will get in detail what exactly the slew rate means
i cannot simplify this r x term anymore its right, it is of order n minus 1, but that is about it right i cannot do anything else
so this one, so then you can vary the parameter two ways, right that’s what we did low number of notes and high number of notes shared, so low and high
now emotional memories they mostly involve the attainment and blocking of personal goals in children as well as in adults, okay
first thing is called the actual arrival time
so, if 2 divides n then n is not odd
the no load current is only less than 5 percent, then i should show the length of this particular current i2 dash as almost 20 times or 25 t imes whatever is my no load current, which right now i am not able to show, so i am assuming that you guys understand basically the constraints that the reason i have shown this as the load current
so, it is more like 3 directions
so the electrical energy input we have accounted for as the area across that shaded portion
fine, so here the problem with bounded skew is sometimes referred to as bst bounded skew, tree problem, and useful skew means, as i had said, that although we talked about skew across arbitrary points, it is the global skew, but in practice, local skews is more important
you repeat this same thing by y
so, yes, now we can see, right
one thing i have to mention is, we put them in parallel because both of the quantities, that is the flux established as well as the losses due to hysteresis and eddy current, both of them depend upon the voltage that i am applying
so, here you can see in the denominator, you can clearly distinguish all three poles
we can use strategies such as designing learning by doing or lbd activities for articulation such as in the prediction example, we can provide them self assessment rubrics for evaluation self assessment, this helps reflection
sorry, it needs the resource r2 and r2 is already blocked by is already locked by t2 and therefore t1 gets blocked
so you see the output resistance of the source follower
so, it does not j anymore, because it knows that it is const, so it cannot change and this one is a changing value
therefore, s i 2 is equal to v 1 to the power 4 minus whatever is given here you put p 2 x 1 minus q 2 r 1 whole square minus 4 into p 2 r 1 plus q 2 x 1 magnitude, magnitude v 1 square right
so, it's a loan but which can be traded in the debt market
in the screen what you see there is a ua741, right
so, will you agree that this is one equation in 5 variables
it is only a decorative element
so, i am going to have r2 dash by s equal to infinity
in any semiconductor, the total charge should be balanced
then we have the so it means once you add the direct three cost factory overheads and administrative overheads
professor ray birdwhistell had suggested that there are three types of kinesics, and he has listed emblems, illustrators and affect displays in his research work
so, food as culture is related to tradition and nostalgia
about the input capacitance, the equivalent capacitance measured at either the inverting or non interval terminal with the other terminal connected to ground, may not be on all specification sheets
so, then what will happen this is the same circuit the only difference is that instant of applying a voltage v 1 i am just applying 0 volt
never ever i will only excite b b dash then i may excite c c dash then i may excite a a dash
so, here once the temperature exceeds 500 degrees then we need to set a physical clock and then check whether the coolant shower is actually getting on within 100 millisecond otherwise the system would be considered as failed
that is the total integral
so, we are given these sales and then we have to use the previous actual sales in some cases and use the forecasted sales in the some cases
i am showing them in the form of concentrated winding
but let us say i have a time constant electrical time constant for this circuit which is l by r, some l by r
this this one can be written as v 1 angle theta 1 plus theta 2, right
also, if we recall what we discussed in case of balance star star or y y connected network
you see if it is released again light will turn off
then in this case gm divided by gm that is the new value of gm compared to the original value of gm is just km prime divided by kn
that means his mind would have resolved all this, but for a common person and it may not be also your mind which is creating this
we have seen three concepts names which are what we use to remember values, values which are the actual quantities which we assign to names and we said that there is a notion of a type
but the standard process of isometric is, you are permitted to use only 30 degrees
so, this is the boundary condition if you make v i lower than this then output will go from positive to negative ok
what else did we do
we are measuring frequency with this expression right count by gate time; number of cycles by gate time
so, the idea was that you need to learn what are the process to finally fabricate mosfet, correct
but the virtual memory also has memory protection as a offsuit or as a byproduct, all virtual memory systems, they support memory protection feature
if everything is equal then there is no interface the z part right i have not said anything about the z part because i got e 1 multiplied by e 2 and e 2 multiplied by e 1
if i am going with that 25 mm, here this is fine perfectly fine
any length scale which we would like to use we have to show it by line with arrows terminating heights
1 nanometer
tree of n nodes, suppose if there are n nodes in a particular graph and we are creating tree containing all the n nodes then it will have the following property
i do not really when i write the macro, i do not need really need to know what the type is whether it is int or it is double
the book also manifests as a physical object, a collection of printed pages which is bounded in a particular fashion
so, there are many standard for this power control like acpi, we have got a control standard for this power control
actually when i am going to connect the load across these, so i let us say i connect the 3 phase resistive load i am just showing as though i am connecting 3 phase resistive load here
so, excellent, excellent way of quickly looking at the circuit working of the circuit and this is how you can implement the peak detector, this is how we can implement the peak detector
4 kv is the voltage and current is two hundred ampere
starting with a initial partition, we repeat iteratively the process till the cutsets keep improving
so, this term this integral over here our life has become simple because automatically it is restricted only to the region of interest v 2
yeah, it might be something that would again be a hassle for him to go to where exactly the teacher is asked him to go or he wants to go, so yeah
so, at that time now if you have made a product which you can look at only on the machine, only on your computer they cannot access it on their mobile or maybe a tablet or something else then how will they look at it, they have to again based there time in office
so because of which we said i is constant
that is, as the water goes into smaller and smaller pores, the relaxation time goes down
so, we will see these concepts we will see these concepts is just to tell you that input bias current is very important input offset current is very important input offset voltage is very important because these all things we have to use and we have to make the output voltage balance that is output voltage should be 0 when we our inverting and non inverting terminals are grounded then only our op amp is balanced then we should use it for further application, right
so this is the m file i will explain to you
this is your pass band, this is your pass band, this is your high pass response, low pass response, this is reject; so band stop response
and again, different boundary conditions simply supported continuous diagonal bending, two directions spanning and cantilevered walls or cantilevered beams in a wall
so, these are basic class descriptions of the landline, mobile and smart phones
so, we will now look at different kind of puf so this is known as arbiter puf and essentially this has certain different properties compared to the ring oscillator puf that we have seen
and you understand that these two things are correlated they are outcome of the same process because light travels faster therefore you see lighting first and the sound you receive little later
so vt is equal to it into r, that is the ohams law or will become v s is equal to r into i s into s domain
so temporarily they might, the status might change and that creates the problem, right
now that we have seen the basics about how to define classes and objects, let us define an interesting data structure
so, person person cancel ultimately it will become 0
so, once reference plane is constructed; normal to that, i would like to have something like a sketch, a hexagon, done
now, the main advantage of cmos over nmos or bipolar transistor is that; much smaller power dissipation, and this is very important, because we are going to reduce the number of components, or increase the number of components on a single wafer , reduce the size of component and increase the number of component on the single wafer, when you are going to do that when you going to reduce the size the power consumption also get subsequently reduced, that is possible by using the cmos technology compared to bipolar transistor or nmos technology
now, another motivation behind having ah this apriory step of detecting false path and and removing them from the consideration is that there are many circuits where number of paths can grow exponentially with the number of gates or in number of lines
first of all for simply checking that the result that you have got after a lot of algebra is correct, and also to get some intuition about the circuit
see in this is a table showing the application point productivity
the absence of illustrators indicates a certain lack of interest in latin american countries
at the same time the instructor should also follow up and provide them with the desired learning resources
in this particular exercise we are going to be looking at the behavior in compression as being linear elastic
we have built a serial connection, then a1, a2, a3 analog ports are connected with x, y, z out of the accelerometer
so the convention is, so far we have been using symbols like d we will say that this is the time domain picture and if i want to talk about its fourier transform that is a spectral component i will write it as d tilde ok, so this is the frequency domain ok
s is really far, far away
all right, then i would have gotten b dot d l right and thinking that this are in the direction b dot b l
so, it's extremely important to remember that this equivalence is only for the increments
but, what if we actually want a global integer
so, have i escaped the second derivative, is there any first second derivative in the first term negative second term is there
if we are manufacturing only one product then we will now go for the minute micro level of the analysis, complete dissection of the cost and trying to understand what contributes the cost, total cost of the one unit of our product
and also sir you have to see how keyboard as a form of entry came into existence
it is used to design this circuit diagrams or the internal circuit of the amplifiers and lot more
so, python does not give you an error, it takes all these invalid ranges, anything where for example, the starting point to the ending point does not define a valid range, and it says this is the empty string
you as a person your team of course is there, but you as a person you are already aware of what is the sign off date for alpha, what is the sign of date for beta, final sign off date for gold; you are already briefed
so it tells you that, okay, so the optimal gypsum for this cement is around eight percent, okay
say this entire thing is the heap and within the heap you have various chunks the orange color shows the allocated chunks and the blue color shows the free chunks
so, the key will now it considered being an undefined key
if i look at the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates, this angle is phi, this distance is s and this height is z
now, since the , pure capacitor draws a leading current at ninety degree right with v and ic is shown perpendicular this symbol is a perpendicular to v and leading by your v by 90 degree
therefore, the this this one your what you call then just hold on, then this one is the difference in level between the support, h is equal to 70 minus 30 40 meter, and note that both the towers on the same side of the point of minimum sag if it is said so, that means x 1 is negative right later we will see
here is a different path drawn in red and notice that these 2 paths actually, start in different directions from the first point and they never meet except with the target
actually, some of you had been the old programmers in pascal, you will recognize that this was the inequality in pascal, but this is not a defined symbol in c++
start slip is equal to one right therefore, from the equation 27 you put s is equal to 1, then you will get this is expression for the starting torque
the other side of this is typ ing
the super ego on the other hand it now gives moral governance to you
that as a negative charge builds up in the cloud base a corresponding positive charge is induced on the earth as shown in figure 14 a
now active circuits, some common examples of these active circuits are amplifiers, mixers and various other active circuits that are used
30 lakhs or 11 lakhs, you are keeping 5 lakhs, you are running short by 6 lakhs
first is, of course, the placement, so how to places the blocks such that the signal delays will meet the timing constraints as per our requirements
because as if something which is public, which you can sit outside the class in a global function or in the member function of some other class you can sit there and be able to see what is happening in all public members
so, u prime x this is my u over here
so, for this we can align the planes of these two, the the slot and the pin into one another
so, basically what happen this 5 and 10 ohm are in series
but i had also mentioned that it is just an analysis formula, here we will find out input reflection percussions there will be no wonder what the characteristic impedance and the length of the individual transmission line segments are
next liability is the rent payable
so reducing the power consumption is of paramount important
so, let us assume that this is 159
we either require direct material, direct labour working on the plant and then the direct expenses which are incurred while manufacturing the product or converting the raw material into the finished products
we have also discussed that a reference parameter can be a general input/output parameter for a function
this is my point r prime this is my point r which way is n hat
so when you are analyzing the operating point of a circuit with diodes, you have to assume that each diode was either in saturation or linear and work out the calculations and see which is consistent
7 volts plus 100mmilovlt sine omega t
on the other hand, if i am make dl very very fine, i will get the correct answer, but it may take me 10 times more time on the computer, then i should have spent on it
4 hertz per unit megawatt this is r
or the opposite geometry, for the type of geometry also can be implemented
all kids so, the brain network which actually cause good attention span have not developed, all kids they have attention deficit, all kids are overactive by simple boredom, by simple this they that every kid is a impulsive
the second theoretical approach is in a way not very different from the first one
remember for instance we saw that in a dictionary even if we add a sequence or values in the particular order we ask for the values after sometime they may not written in the same order, because internally there is some optimization in order to make it fast to look up a value for it
and since we have a stock of 2,09, 4,900, of which 2000 is purchased on 27, the remaining 2,900 is purchased on 22nd
so, this is my z y z y z y right this is a n a same thing this is actually it is same thing it is small a , this is your small c , and this is your small b , same thing
so, it is the difference between these two head quantities which actually drives current through the resistance of the armature circuit we will see later
let us begin it in this way
so, we construct a line parallel to that dropping through vertical
so ignore this
so, 5,000 upon 40,000 into 4,000 90,000
so, word marks are marks which pertain to a word alone, and it gives the right only for the use of the word or the letters or the numbers
from a biological point of view there are certain things which are extremely important because of the simple fact that you are a biological creature
when you prepare the budgeted balance sheet, what we do in the budgeted balance sheet
so, at cut off what happens is the transistor is cut off, its drain current is zero, and this is as good as an open circuit
so here with me i have people who have experienced applying design thinking and practice in real life problems, real life situations, real life customers, real life people whom they have tried to help and they are still in that process of helping them
these are now you see as i am telling you that management accounting doesn't have its own discipline or its own way or set or techniques of developing the information
and we are also we are assuming it is a for each whether it is a star or delta does not matter, we assume a pure resistive load, so power factor of the load is unity right
so once i have a netlist with this slack values calculated and this slacks are positive, to start from that point
a speaker converts an electrical signal to sound; microphone converts sound into electrical signals
so if i actually look at my armature equivalent circuit alone i will have an excitation emf or eg or ef
this is also considered to be an important micro expression because we find that often the twitch occurs in the corners of the mouth in almost an imperceptible manner
now we can also use image analysis based on gray levels for quantification and all time people say to me “well, how do you know that the area you measure on a poly section is the same as the volume fraction
1 right, so that is something that we can use
implementation of the edf is a problem because you see here all the tasks have to be kept if there are n tasks then n tasks have to be maintained and the scheduler needs to compute the completion time for all the tasks to fight the earliest deadline
so, it is important that you let the jacobian
and then he started, means, when the concept was workable, product was acceptable to the people, he started growing, growing, growing, and today you can say that nirma is at least a international company
this is the schematic, so we can move a data from left to right or from bottom to top
so, this is going to be the objective of i mean the approach that we will follow for all integral equations somehow get it into ax is equal to b where a and b are known solve for x
4 ohm resistance uc is now short circuited because the voltage was which was available here, we short circuited that voltage source
in a similar way we can find somewhere in the entire executable where the string slash bin slash bash is present
so, what we see here, the drain characteristics is i d versus v d s
now for further simplification how will do
this being a second order differential equation has two independent solutions and those solutions are named after bessel right
how to use a photoresist and what kind of masks are there
and now you connect that r l is equal to 4 ohm resistance in terminal work loss terminal 1 and 2
and then using these using this abcd matrix we can write down the s 11 and s 41, we can find out the s 11 and s 41 parameters using the conversion equations
now, if you apply different input signal and see what kind of output you can see in the oscilloscope
so, your vth and rth is already fixed, if rl is also fixed, you cannot find the maximum power transfer condition
from that you can find out that torque will be developed right
so, i have just copied this diagram once again here
so, when it sees the definition of a function, it will digest it but not execute it
so use that
5, i mean in the range of h by l 1 to 1
this is the pid and this is what we had we have used here
that ah your what you call that vn is equal to this rn ah rn is i have writing here rn
so it is absolutely, you can say, discouraged that some interconnection between two, two elements in the layout should be made on the diffusion layer
what is charge
now, disconnect the network be defined a voltage v open circuit across the terminal of network a
however, in the real world this really happens even in the op amp in equation has 0 common mode gain the output voltage may not be 0 this deviation is nothing, but your offset, this deviation is your offset a perfect op amp would output exactly have 0 volts where both inputs are sorted right like here both inputs are sorted and output should be 0 volts right
so, 3 p p plus j your q p sorry 3 into p p plus jq p is equal to this one
4 times 10 to the 6, correspondingly conductivity is 3
now we need to find out the h parameters, so we will use the basic definition for in case of h parameters
and as soon as we make them as part of the class, then we use them just look at the difference
but right now i am essentially looking at the generator action
so, this is like 1,000 by 1,010
so, as you can see, there are codes for stone masonry, a code of practice for stone masonry, rubble stone masonry, ashlar masonry, which is a more formal stone masonry, hollow concrete concrete block masonry, hollow and solid concrete block masonry, construction methods, that's a late, a newer version of the previous code, autoclaved cellular concrete blocks, and lightweight concrete blocks
the x is the column vector of a 1 up to a n and b is a column vector of the incident field at various points r 1 ei of r n ok
so, v a is equal to v 1 plus v 2 arrow is given to represent it is phasor
the compiler implicitly would compute that, this is the end of scope for s and implicitly put this call at the end of the scope
i am in s k and my input is s k
now, when we come to the next row, the holes will automatically block the paths coming from the wrong direction
is that debatable
5 seconds t r also about ten fifteen second it is very ah high value
now, if i want to draw this only in terms of v p instead of without have the v n ok, then this curve will shift the origin ok, which way will it shift towards the left or towards the right take an example
so, initially, let us consider that the when we apply the dc source, the capacitor is charged with polarities as shown in figure
now if you use the same expression and take fmt to 0, then you get the classical condition where this cracking is occurring when eccentricity is equal to l by 6
so, what, but i mean this is the place where i am using a priori information, i am using the apriori information that the cross section of breast tissue is a natural image; i know i am empirically it has been observed the natural images are sparse in wavelet domain in discrete cosine domain and so on
here if you look in the circuit that 5 micro farad and 20 micro farad are in series ; that means, you have to combine it like the way you do it when resistors are in parallel
so, we are in the process of learning about the budgets and budgetary control and in the previous classes we have discussed in detail that what is budget and largely we talked about the master budget
then as i have already told you two important concepts are there in a feasibility study, the benefits and costs
it was 450,000 rupees
there is a point d 20 mm below horizontal plane; horizontal plane, vertical plane 20 mm below means somewhere here and 30 mm in front of vertical
where he said that find you can divide individuals into four groups, the sanguine types, the melancholic types, the choleric type and the phlegmatic type and each of these types, he gave certain characteristics
so, this is v i and let me draw
but still customer says no, product is of bad quality, claims a compensation of 10 lakhs
many chips, resistors, integrated circuits have to be properly produced at industries that requires careful way of drawing sketches, representing ideas
and this hydration reaction can really go on for many years although it is probably like eight percent complete within the first twenty eight days
so, why i mean if i just want to amplify why do, i need this attenuator, i can connect the input directly here
so, the important property which we have to assume here is that the matrix si minus a is nonsingular means the determent of this particular matrix is not equal to 0
so, it is your minus 1 i is equal to 6 ampere
so, plus terminal if this thing your, what you call if you move clock wise
what i need to do is to subtract this ia zs from here, this is minus ia zs, ef minus ia zs will give me what is my vt
so, second order circuits can typically series rlc circuit or parallel rlc circuits or maybe the 2 storage elements of the different type or same type; same type means that the elements can be either 2 inductors or 2 capacitors but these elements cannot be represented by an equivalent single element
most of you are right, we will deduct the profit
then what you have to do pre bake at 90 degree, then what you have to do load the mask
in the earlier balance sheet we have called it borrowings as an example, but any liability which is of long term in nature is called as a non current liability
so, if i put these 2 into 1, i can apply this to space, i can apply this to time right, so let us write down the first term right
so, we can directly see silicon
so you need to have this fourth parameter, which is the compare function pointer
so therefore it is out of the scope as far as this course is concerned to calculate and rate the components for thermal stresses
let us look at class g, class g cannot access, so many different things for example, class g cannot access y, class g cannot access y
and typically you evaluate this in terms of either the input voltage or the output voltage whichever you wish to have
binomial transformer has a very flat response but lesser band width, chebyshev polynomial because it is aligned from ripple; it has a wider band width
this certain things i mean basic thing you have to keep it in mind right
and then we will see what are the etching techniques, then we will see how the mosfet is fabricated
these are the ones that develop a magnetic moment proportional to the applied field, or, to define it very precisely, this becomes equal to a magnetic susceptibility: chi m times h
4 volt and so on right
the promoter group is mukesh ambani group because mukesh ambani and family owns major stake in the company
so, i must modify this in this way
so we drew the phasor diagram for the generator, which i want to specify once again
since we will be mostly dealing with metals as conductors, i will also write them as just metals
so these two put together, that is kp and kd the product of these two will always be called as kw which is the winding factor
welcome back to the session on design thinking
the constant
now, j minus 1 by 2 may not be an integer
as you recall, pointing vector actually is a physical quantity which indicates how much energy per unit area is flowing
similarly, your 25 ohm that is this circuit, this circuit 25 ohm resistor, right
so, line number 14 corresponds to the call to this particular function
so, stage a where we are considering only the presence of gravity forces, uniform compression at the base, the base is fixed and you have the lateral restraint at the top support
so, when we overload the basic conceptualization is that all overloaded functions must have very related functionality
so you said in conflict with the content that you are already giving in textbooks and notebooks because textbook and notebook is essentially the content that you want your users to see and access, so is there something that is different that is going in your download tab that is not available in textbook and notebook
8kva, the apparent power , now
now i will draw the small signal equivalent including the capacitors so that you can find the constraints on them
so, when you are picking the things you have to make keep hold of that control button
so, we have to do the evaluation of these integrals in the presence of a singularity
and this particular criterion can be used only for the shear sliding criterion
so, the semiconductor we have is gallium arsenide and we want to know what sort of elements could be added as dopants to gallium arsenide to make it p or n type
they do not incorporate timing issues during initial placement because, as i had said that, unless you do placement you do not get accurate information regarding the delays
so, now the slice has been moved up now let us give 10 mm
so, that we will be in a position to construct, a free surface on that object
so this is because the text segment is created dynamically at runtime and the elf executable and the elf object files do not have any notion about stack
we talked about disadvantage, so i wanted to tell you about the advantage as well
so, he was teaching at massachusetts institute of technology in the us
you are not unfamiliar with the vector notation
so, again the motion of planets and such objects was the main interest which led to all of these laws being formulated
so, 20 to 30 seconds is the elastic time limit for which information can be stored in the short term memory
but if i do there have this then the picture changes then what happens is that the slice operation produces a new list which has exactly the same length and the same values and it makes list2 point to that
and if you multiply by this, this works out as how much
so the physical energy getting converted into a, an impulse which the brain can process is the process of transduction, and this transduction is we can consider as the first step towards perceiving the external world
so, integrating from 0 to h will simply give me a
i personally think that if you look at the whole you know this common myth of madness related to creativity and genius, this is a common myth
so, these are some of the factors you have to take into account and choosing materials performing p n junction
in this module we would look at haptics and its role particularly in the handshakes
so, masonõs rules are somewhat of an easier way of achieving implementation of signal flow graphs and if we go to the slides on the on the monitor then the gain that isé suppose we have 2 nodes, if we can come back to the slides on the on the writing slides
now, there are many different types of errors and some of these we have seen, but we may not have noticed the subtelty of these for example, when we run python and we type something which is wrong, then we get something called a syntax error and the message that python gives us is syntax error invalid syntax
so, let us look at in one case and another case over here ok
the add takes two integer parameters and returns an integer in the second case, it takes two double parameters and returns a double
we have noticed that, you have not we have not done it through newton raphson method, but couple newton raphson method also works equally ol, right
like this: y, say, is going in x, cross y, z direction is going up
if it is frame number 0 there are two frames if we select n it runs a, b, c, d, otherwise it runs a b d and then the frame number is incremented
by definition, the vector potential a r will be equal to mu naught over four pi integration: j r prime over r minus r prime, d v prime
usually, when we are constructing these kind of projection of planes we will have multiple figures to distinguish that at the first figure level we write a, in the next figure level we write it a 1
so, this is v r right and this current is lagging by an angle theta
so, let us take a sphere with uniform charge density rho r and this problem you have solved in your 12th grade, if you apply gauss’s law and calculate the field inside at a distance r this field comes out to be rho r by 3 epsilon naught
the shape of the mouth normally communicates evaluation gestures
8 is the amount of chloride whereas in lc3 you have only about 0
so, because of whom that variance has occurred, it is a favorable variance
in this case it is going to be how much 3 means 600 hours and in this case it is going to be how much 1,000 hours
so what you can say that the two watt meter method is not only providing the total real power, but also the reactive power and the power factor
now again it is suppressing the signall it is again suppressing the signal
ok, so testing of a fabricated device or a board, whatever you say, is very important in the context of the overall design flow of a vlsi system
if that is the case, this cannot be this drawing whatever the drawing we have, that cannot be a first quadrant projection
so, that says wave like solution is what is obtained right now, what do i do; so, this equation over here, i can add it over here and replaced by what kind of a second derivative can be replaced by a finite differences right
accordingly you can have the code written
so, the value of energy which would be stored in the capacitor would be half of c v naught square, now, we will know that when we see this particular circuit there would be one loop and if you apply kirchhoffs current law at this particular node what you will get, we will get simply ic plus ir equal to 0
so, you are going to have large number of sigma and sigma star
and 2 voltage sources are there, it is 5 volt plus minus and the 3 volt here also minus plus this way it has been marked
sir before the boundary it should
that is induced by the complete or the interpreted task that becomes a critical factor, okay
so this distance will be square root, s square plus v square t square
so, if aslr is enabled on the system we invoke this part particular function arch randomize break which essentially is present here
and this is going to be how much
now, we will go to the previous slide that is readsms
so, radius i would like to have something like 10 units, then click ok
exactly the same concept in signals i worked in time and frequency now i will work in space and spatial frequency
so, discretizing the integral equation like what we did is equivalent in the language of method of moments to choose a delta function as the testing function
25 was used
so it is there for us to go out of the market
so we can take precautionary measures so that this delay can be avoided
welcome to lecture 40
so, anyway so here we have a um for simplification we have made this your what you call circuit like this and this is your load resistance part right
multiple functions by the same name and you are given one call site; you are given one call where you are trying to figure out which of this multiple candidates should be used
so, emf per turn is equal to e 1 upon n 1 is equal to e 2 by n 2 is equal to 15, it is given therefore, n 1 is equal to e 1 upon 15 that is that is also v 1 up on e 1
now, notice the peculiar word is not
so, root mean square value depends on the heating effect that is square of the current as soon as we are taking in terms of square of the current basically, it depends on the heating effect because i square r we have seen, i square r is lost in the dc circuit
on the output side you see there are 3 connectors, normally closed , a common , which is connected to ground and normally open
but we not going in detail just an understanding that if diffusion occurs or not
but if you wherever you keep remember one thing this is one practice i am observing in several places where people forget that these are heavy cylinders, if they fall they will hurt horribly bad
and that is what we wrote as rather than writing i ei dt, i can write the same thing as i d lambda integral
so in that case, if calculate the value of the current ip, what you can do, you can simply use kirchhoff voltage law in the loop and find out the value of current ip
it can be upward direction, it will be downward direction also; instead of 315 degrees, if i am going to make it 30 degrees, it goes down
so, this one with the base it makes perpendicular angle; that means it is 90 degrees, such kind of cones are called right circular cones
so, but our cases is we will only consider that load frequency control will cannot consider this part will not consider this part
and, this one when we are looking at that with respect to the horizontal plane it makes an angle alpha or phi
so in this class we will talk about admittance parameters which are also called as y parameters
mosfet is nothing, but your metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
so, there are two things that i have to worry about alright
so, if i want to do compute sine or compute square root or compute arctan, i do not need to write that function i can just use it from the library
we cannot have something that is green very environmentally friendly but very expensive to use, especially in civil engineering cost is very very important so there is the economic impact to be taken into account
so, we are dividing it by 1600; that means, this megawatt will be converted to power unit megawatt
so, one part of it deals with how to convert the load bearing perforated shear wall into an equivalent frame and the other part actually requires that the masonry pier and the masonry spanrills lateral load behavior in the form of some idealized force displacement nonlinear curve is available for you to be able to carry out nonlinear static or even cyclic analysis for which you will require a hysteric curve, positive and negative cycles also available
this is one example which shows how effective design and integration of technology is critical
because here the major axis and the minor axis are of different lengths, that is a reason it forms an ellipse
so, so far all i did is i took my maxwell’s equation over here and integrated over this shaded surface over here that is fine right
net generated
or it can be an algebraic function of other constants and, or system parameters
i should have these 2 points, but i have nothing in in simplest current mirror circuit
so, let us see the slide
a matched line is a special case of transmission line where a load zl with a transmission line having characteristic impedance z0 is connected
similarly, on the other side there are two transistors which are of course two x
this could be you know cross section of your head, cross section of breast or could be a tree trunk could be anything
first thing is that you note this is the place where we are specifying the interrupt service routine
so, if you and and and every time i will not put delta p g s delta p l s or delta fs right because it is laplace transform understandable; such that in mathematics writing will be easier right so, but it is understandable
and we would initially talk about dollard and miller and then we will come to the skinnerian approach and finally, we would be talking about alberts banduras, model dollard and miller’s view point is what is called as the early social learning approach basically they attempted testing the freudian concept of neurotic behavior in lab on rats
among other things, what you can do with these string functions is for example, search for text or search and replace it
that means, it will affect the processing of silicon
second is from the function which is x and its address
so, we have to create a portfolio where we have both the securities risky and less risky securities
for n two, two and two, let say, will be following this path
so, we will put it under the head of expenses
let say we have a full adder
and ted cruz, also has some work to do on his smile
so, it is v square by r is equal to 50 square by 25, and is equal to also i square r i is equal to minus 2 square into 25
does the intended learning outcomes will constitute clear statements of what the learners are expected to learn as a result of engaging in a particular learning process
so, it is simple now we will take total dividend and divide it by number of shares
what is load rejection
and two intersperse content with activities and assessment include interactivity, include learner control by strategies such as reflection spots, learning by doing activities and formative assessment in between the video
once you understand the psychology behind colors, you will be better equipped to take on the world
so, vo is nothing but 1 plus r2 by r1 all right
once this rectangle is constructed, we want views of that
so, both positive and negative type of scenarios that you experienced and the situations wherein you responded and the type of response that you got positive and negative feedback from the environment you can map it very nicely to the schedule of reinforcement and then you can think that
this part of the code is the same basically, but we have taken two variables
now remember one thing about moss transistors, it could be in triode region or saturation region or cut off
the same way i should be able to say here also, if my current is flowing like this right, so i am going to have the flux lines produced in this particular direction
so, this parameters r 1 x 1, r 2 x 2 and r 3 x 3 this all are in per unit and same parameters are taken same loads are taken for your understanding
so, one solution is this so the solution is very simple one solution is this if i so, use a different type of switch which is called a make before break switch
now this is actually going to have the armature now
so, finally we will be more concerned about this standard which is called as the expected standards
let’s look at the definitions and connotations of normal work place or business gaze
so, they are very particular finding out whether their kid actually is following the normal course of development or not
we will write kvl for this mesh, so what we can write
first, is input offset voltage, we have seen, right
so if you see the expression, if l 1, l 2 or m tends to infinity in such a manner that n remains the same, the coupled coils will become the ideal transformer
are there any exceptions like for interest
so this is a typical solution to the floor planning problem, including power and ground planning
so, if he is a small manufacturer and he is supplying it to maruti and maruti is stretching the payment or delaying the payment then it is unethical should because the buyer uhhh is doing all these things because seller is not in position to take action against the buyer
so the width of the lines is not fixed, unlike the signal lines
here, we have a simple string class as you have seen earlier also there is a container which basically is a pointer to character which is suppose to keep as history and another data member gives the length
so, therefore, by adjusting the load difference setting that u right, through actuation of the speed changer motor the power output generator unit at, it you know at a desired level i mean this thing can be changed right
and we will click ok on this mini tool bar
so this is: chi m is going to be greater than zero for paramagnetic materials and chi m is less than zero
i think we can realize and now the at least probably another 20 to 30 percent reduction in co2 emissions worldwide, 20 to 30 percent emissions on cementitous sector would be equivalent to 1 or 2 percent of all the emissions that, of everything (())
so i am left with integration of zero to capital r, because that is approve which the charge has been assembled: r raise to four d r, which gives me an answer: four pi by three, epsilon by zero rows square times
so, we have to find out the variances and then we will have to try to find out the reasons for the variances and control those variances so that next time these variances do not occur, the situation do not, means does not arise and we are able to control the operations in every respect in every sense and finally arrive at the estimates which we want to miss the targets, the goals, the objectives which we want to achieve
so, what we have to do is either in this direction 30 degrees or perhaps in this in this way 30 degrees we have to align
so, it will be v is equal to r 1 plus j l 1 omega into i 1 minus j omega m i 2, i told you the sign will be minus because current here is entering and it is leaving now you have taken, this is equation 14 say here in this loop p where there is no voltage source here
so, 25
and you have to find out first what is rab equivalent resistance of this circuit first you have to find out right
so in is the current flowing in the nth branch
what is the difference between these two cases
so, f s by f design would define what that factor itself is
so, this is why i said that for matched lines, gamma l should be equal to 0
so i do not want that current to go up beyond whatever is the rated value
so, if we look at 100 milli volt depolarization which is what the standard tells us, does it actually mean a lot
what do you mean by electromagnetic waves
so, this is approximately true and this will be equal to i sc
so, here i have written that it is delta f then it is minus 1 upon r if you reduce it and it will be 1 upon 1 plus st g and this delta e how things are coming
so, we can just walked out remove the 28 and promote the 21
student: in case we too confusing coco cola with a large number of right from 1900 to 2000, we have changed this quite updated on every 10 years every 5 years we changes design
relays can be of two types, mechanical and solid state
so what you predicted was that, ah, the number of transistors, of the basic components that you can pack inside a single integrated circuit, would be doubling every eighteen months or so
so this is equal to sigma r delta r
so, let us put the value r 3 should be point 9
that is true, this is
you had seen this notation earlier when we talked about vectors in contrasts to add is you had seen, if i have it have a vector then i could put the element type within the corner bracket similarly, if i have a stack within this angle brackets we are showing what is the type of the element that the stack will be made of and stack objects name will be s
now you see the background is light
so, these are the two questions that we are going to answer in the next few minutes, okay
without overloading the transformer you would be able to get 100 amperes, right
we have seen in the previous lecture that a point dipole gives gives me a vector potential which is mu zero over four pi m, cross r over r cubed
first point that is our p, the second point where these generatrix horizontal line intersecting is p1
so, they have written that in that context
so, the at the field inside a 0
now, ratios can be classified in variety of ways
so, the front view, so in the front view i will see this horizontal plane just like a line ok
that means number of stages in the l, f, s, r and these is kind of a coding from where you are taking the taps
sales collection budget because these are the sub budgets
are very dependent on temperature and also on other properties of the mass transistor like the threshold voltage and so on, whereas the resistor could potentially be accurately fixed
for manufacturing one finished product, you use hundreds of the sub products and what milligre sometimes we use the material in the milligrams so how many milligrams of the material has to be used for manufacturing the one unit of the say finished product that's really very very complex jobs very very typical job and if you and sometimes materials are so expensive that if you waste even aota of that material, little part of that material that costs us a very big loss to the firm
it is normally, suppose you sell some item, you can give a credit for two months, three months, four months, which will mean a 90 days or 120 days period
if i have more and more number of poles, correspondingly for the south pole i will have a dash, a1 dash, a2 dash and so on and so forth
if i want to write this very similarly in c++, i will change and write this as class complex
and, i can convert pointers to constant pointers
so, we have seen here this hinge mate
suppose you have a large system to be designed
so, actu[ally] so alternatively the circuit model of this thing could be used like this
let us look at carefully, the data points what we have is 1, 2, 3, 4
and x 2 dash if you add it it will be your find your 0
so, again, we have the three tasks, 20, 100, 30, 150, 90 and 200
ok, so here you can easily see, this simulation will tell you that only after four it is getting stabilized, unlike the earlier case where you are saying that in output you are getting a constant zero
so, the machine will start accelerating, as it accelerates please note that i am going to get more and more electromagnetic torque, are you getting my point this is the ordinate which represents the electromagnetic torque
so in one night, we can, i can do that thing
so, either we use straight vertical a or an inclined a; if this is inclined is supposed to be 75 degrees, and there will be a guide lines, in that guide lines we draw any lettering
so, unlike your microprocessor like 8085, we do not have separate cpu registers because now the memory that the internal memory is also a part of the of the chip
so, again we try all of them and take the minimum
that is, if we just try to define a reference, but without initializing it with a variable
one fault at a time means we can modify the netlist just like we mentioned earlier, and we do parallel simulation
now with that let us check the stress in steel and the stress in steel because of the stress in steel is estimated because now as the compression controls we have the stress in masonry equal to fb and therefore from similar triangles and compatibility we can estimate what the stress in steel is but this stress in steel works out to be much higher than the permissible stress in steel which is 230 mp
since different societies in our world today have different gender norms, these gender norms are not necessarily symmetrical and therefore, we find that different types of cultures have different designated spaces for different genders
on vp we will see that is m and on auxiliary front view we will see
so, r prime unless i specify r prime i cannot actually evaluate this first or second integral was where is r prime all i have said is all that extinction theorem says is r prime must belong to v 2 and r prime must belong to v 1 in the second part right
and after every time period the sinusoid is repeating itself
i is outside d l prime cross r minus r prime over r minus r prime cubed, which i can write as mu zero i over four pi integral d l prime is nothing but d y in the y direction
but what we will do is to derive a simple expression for g of e for a solid with uniform potential
again, the subject matter of copyright is not based on its intellectual merit; you can have a copyright on bills, coupons, telephone directories databases
if you talk about if this pen is there and this pen is costing us 100 rupees, say this pen is costing us 100 rupees, it means 85 rupees of this pen's cost is because of the two elements of the material and labor
8 degree that is why this voltage is 42
so when the members are subjected to tension, so all the portions of the element or the member are not directly connected as a as a result are not directly, are not directly under tension
now, global router typically completes the routing on a single layer
so if the torque is continuously oscillatory whether i like it or not there will be a very little small changes in omega d omega by dt will not be 0 at any point in time in a single phase machine
the current flowing here is gm times bgs which is gm times this whole thing
these two are subsets of this
we will add it back
now, plus 1 upon sc will be the value of the capacitor here because when you say the current is i s flowing through the circuit so i s into 1 by sc will be the drop of across capacitor plus the voltage that is v0 at v at time t equal to 0 and by s and when you sum up you will get the value at v in s domain
zero output impedance will be the output voltage
to learn it effectively from videos, learners need to engage with the content of the video by doing cognitive activities while viewing the video
now so, when i try to use these equations the what is the one thing to enforce given these equations how do i proceed further
the denominator just be sum of the weights
the middle finger salute, everybody knows that pointing this finger at somebody is really rude
in certain cases, if we are making many more revolutions, similar procedure has to be followed
now, when i remove 0 2 which is this one, i find that both these neighbors i explored
you will measure the rth here
similarly, collaborative activities around simulations help in social construction of knowledge; that means, learners students are learning from their peers; they are debating, they are convincing each other, they are developing articulation and argumentation skills, they are negotiating broadening their knowledge
the point i am trying to make is curl of p need not be zero and therefore in general i can write divergence of e, rho, free bound charges, del dot, p over epsilon zero
this is one advantage or one feature
whereas in our case this is not
second is the uncontrollable reason
operating revenue comes from your day to day business, from your profits, from your regular business
so, in this one we can see the slag, we can see how, for example this inner product, this dark area around the slag, it is darker
soft bake, is a process involving temperature of ninety degrees and time of one minute on a hot plate
so, now cash is 2 lakhs, shop, 5 lakhs, no changes here
let us see what is the transmission parameters, basically there are no restrictions on which the terminal voltage and current should be considered independent and which should be dependent
now, what is this non current investment
because you have a positive charge on the p side, the charge density is given by the acceptor ions which have a negative charge, so that this is e na, and the total charge has to be zero, which means the positive charge on the n side has to balance the negative charge on the p side
so, if you have the right to make further copies, any other person who does this, making further copies of your book without your approval or your consent is said to be infringing your right that person is violating a right that you have
and therefore, talking about food or writing about food or representing various images related with food raise important cultural issues in international contexts
germanium is 3900, 1900 for your holes
when the voltage gradient become; 5 to 10 kilo volt per centimeter either between the clouds or between the cloud and the earth
if i make a spherical surface around it you see there is an net flow or water outside at this point no matter how small the surface, this point there will be some water going out
now sometimes it is convenient to use reciprocal of impedances in calculation
now when i connect a load i am going to have 3 phase current flowing through these windings
so i am just showing the slot somewhat like this and we are going to have the windings in the slot like this, so we are going to have the windings inside the slot like this which will be actually a 3 phase winding, so i will have r y b specifically or a b c phases wound independently
436 so, that is 10
so, if i plot this on the origin it will always be pointing in which direction
for instance, if you had type declarations you can say that the name t is of type tree and then you can use this value like none all programming languages have such a value which denotes something that does not exist
so the next is the field work that you need to be doing
so in this plot for instance, v2 is the parameter
so, let me let me clear it and similarly for q 2 the charge on c 2 is equal to 0 initial charge on c 2 is equal to actually 0 right
as the name suggests, it is other than revenue if any income is generated, it is shown separately
we have a technology library where there is a set of cells which are pre designed and are kept in the library
00410 right and similarly i 4 you calculate right
so that means, l 1 is equal to actually l 1 d phi 1 upon d i1 it is actually self inductance of coil 1 right this is self inductance of coil 1
but to get an estimate of how much signal we can apply, we say that if it is within these wing limits, then the amplifier behaves linearly and otherwise it doesn't
if this is v1, i1, v2, i2, this will be delta v1, delta i1, delta i1, delta v2 and delta i2
we will try to make it only balanced, so all the three transformers have to be balanced
so, this will give me what is the rotor copper loss
if you swap them, if you make this minus and this plus that circuit you know, virtual for that circuit virtual sorting will not happen, that acts as a schmitt trigger we told you
so the cross sectional area of the splice plate we can calculate from this that means dividing the appropriate portion of the factor load coming from the splice plate coming over the splice by the yield stress right
so, computation is going to increase, but that is a price that i have to pay for solving this
after this, after post baking i will etch my metal
so in summary oscillators as we as i mentioned you know little different from other amplifier circuits that we have studied so far
so i have brought to you a hypothetical example or hypothetical say information that if you have this kind of information tomorrow in your practical life then how to make use of this information for developing a cost sheet or the statement of the cost and finally deciding that how much should be the cost and if we are given the sales amount budgeted sales amount also then we can pre plan and know it in advance the operating profit we can expect from our production process and the sales
now, if i am drawing a circle at one of the points, either at this point or at this point and revolve this entire object; i will be in a position to construct a pipeline, which is a branch joint
let me write the potential: one over four pi epsilon zero, three q over two r, minus one half q r square over r q, the first term, the constant
so over to the team, the gentlemen here are who have discussed with me and have explained to me what is it that they are working on, we will do a customer journey map so you heard me talk about the steps and that is what we are going to do
compare to the base impedance, the voltmeter impedance has to be quite higher, then i am fine
alpha t here we have been considering about 90% of the total thickness itself
so, let us see a very important application of the mosfet
right, so this; this commander examining he said you should put on light and then release the gas
so, here just look at it that there is a computer inside this airbag system which is continuously monitoring the events and as soon as the motion sensor indicates that there is a collision the computer acts to deploy the airbag within 10 millisecond or less
so, there is a requirement that you provide a gable band, that is called the gable, you provide a gable band and this gable band will ensure that the triangular portion is not susceptible to out of plain failure
602 into 10 to the minus coulomb per electron you are writing into 5524 electrons
so, this is the critical frequency formula for an active filter for the high pass filter and here x equals to r can be calculated using the formula which is here when ideally the response rises abruptly at the critical frequency f l hz
once that is done join b to c by a line similarly join b 2 4 by a line and join a to c the diagonal line wherever this intersection is happening call that point as 2 and 1
so, what is happening at a lower level was to be directly reported to seniors through spies
on the horizontal plane, if we are looking from top view it makes projection p here and projection q here
5 i will still have 5 volts drop
i am writing instead this: yi zero
so, for any individual figure, let us say we want to calculate operating and direct expenses which is 214 1
so, what are the terms of paying the operating expenses
151 times 10 to the 24 per meter cube
similarly if we pass 20 amperes on the secondary side or 10 amperes from the primary side, i call it as the transform is being subjected to rated current
if you take a 75 kilowatt also sometimes available , but if it is not available then for a safety use 125 kilo hour, 150 kilo hour bank, right
if we do that, then i am going to write w as one half integration v
so if you use this particular the condition, you can say that, since you know that, the laplace of sin omega t is omega upon omega square plus s square then for laplace of sin of 2 omega t can be given as by using this equation, you can write simply as 1 by 2 omega upon instead of s you will write s by a, a is 2 here
now we can also use double quotes; and one reason to use double quotes is if you actually need to use a single quote as part of the string
we prepare the cash flow statement
and of course this could be any other nonlinear element as well
now if there is a simple passive band pass filter, then let us do the simulation
however, notice, in this case, the image charge problem: as charge comes in or goes out, the charge density sigma depends on z zero and therefore i cannot use this formula directly
so, this is i mean why the reason why we use this is again it makes the mathematics as we go further on very very simple
to this we will make adjustment for working capital items or ca and cl items now sundry daters had gone down reduction of sundry data means they have paid us money so it is added creditors have also gone down now to creditors for them to go down, we pay them money
this is running very close to the obstacle, parallel, but it is not hitting it anywhere else
suppose sometimes is given suppose if it is given that impedance of a circuit , suppose if it is given that z is equal to say root j , a ohm it is given then what is the value of r what is the value of x right
now this one, when 3 dots are 3 dots let me tell you one thing for the exam purpose, 3 dots are little bit heavy because of time consumption right
01, but in this case, it is coming 0
yeah, the z components, they are whatever appearing only and the medium properties of course, right epsilon 1 and epsilon 2, mu 1 and mu 2
so this is how the magnetizing part freewheels through this freewheeling circuit
keep the vertical plane remain same, the projection we always have that and the projection we flip it into 90 degrees clockwise transfer that radially
so, that is why v k minus infinity was 0 only v k t 0 is kept here right
and the rx pin of arduino must be connected with the tx pin of this particular model
so, either this is the call or this is the call
so, the focus has to be in understanding and isolating the inventive features from the non inventive features
so, what i what we can just sort of intuitively see del dot ds, how many surfaces should we break this up into to evaluate it
a studies tell us that often when people lie that tend to over gaze engaging in more eye contact then what is perceived to be normal in order to emphasize the trustworthiness
let us see the next one bandwidth or gain bandwidth product, very important characteristics of an op amp the gain as a function of frequency for smaller signals right that is output is unlimited by slew rate the lm741 has a gain bandwidth product of 1 megahertz ok
and you can eliminate the variable v0 from these equations and find v test by i test and hopefully i have tried this by yourself and you got it correctly and the correct answer is rg plus rl divided by gmrl plus 1
let us first take that i assemble the charger so that in between, when i have a sphere of radius small r, i bring in the new charge, and that would be
you have lot of clock things to connect right
you have to find out the value of voltage v2 in terms of v1
a positive eye contact during interviews exhibits honesty as well as interest and intentions of the candidate
now personality is basically the individual difference in that characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behavior of the individual
right now it is a liability so we'll mark it as l
so, these vectors put together should span the vector space ok
we will see it exactly follows your input signal it follows the same peak to peak voltage of an input signal you can see it is from 1
i have a test control input, i have a d input, i have an s d input and i have a clock in the output
so the advantage of having the laplace transform is that the differential equations which are coming in the circuit can be easily converted into the algebraic equations and we can solve it easily
what is the addition of these two will be ia zs if i may call that as synchronous impedance
as you put this function names, these are called function pointers
so that everyone can see
but any signal entering port 3 will also have a component appearing at port 2 in addition to the component appearing at port 1
so, if i trying to look at the expression now what we got this is due to stator self inductance variation and this is due to rotor self inductance variation and this is due to mutual
we have seen an example of masking in the fabrication that when we want to etch the wafer from the backside, we have to we have grown silicon dioxide and then have created a window
so, delete is a little bit more complicated than insert
there is a hole which is at 20 units down
it is 180 and then we will take the next one
let us consider a hierarchy of shapes and our basic objective is we are trying to build a graphic system where these shapes can be there on the canvas
so, this term over here is what i have to enforce on the boundary right
assets, equipment and long term investments were i and sundry daters cacl, bank balance
so, before we go into how the attack actually works, we would have to look at the virtual address space of a process
but if i try looking at it after connecting delta a star i am not going to get a good amount of torque
and this one like a pin up to this level because here we will be in a position to see this slot and so on
further away you go, the power splits over a larger area and therefore electric field is going to go down
but then if you want to look at second resources you cannot look at these three surveys and you would exclusively come to know what psychologist have done in this country, the topics that have looked at the type of processes and all other details you will find there
that was the standard and the labour rate was also decided that for example for the skilled we will be paying 10 rupees per hour for the semi skilled we will be paying 6 rupees per hour and for the unskilled we will be paying 4 rupees per hour that was standard
i am the same individual who takes up mechanical task, who takes up spatial task, who takes up language ability, who takes up clerical aptitude, various types of aptitudes and then my aptitude score in one area is compared against my aptitude in the other area and then i am told at i would perhaps be better at this and not at that
the inventers are encouraging to carry out the first level preliminary due diligence check for novelty and inventive step at the ipm cell
so for the onset there is no problem
then you make correction with e and with this this bit also become zero, or with that that bit becomes one, is already one
so, in that way it has got lot of similarity and differences with the pointers
but when i inherit i will have one unique component coming in the derived class object, which is the base component and that is something that you will have to be very aware of in terms of the object layout
it is also good for hoists
so how much this works out as you total it up in a say say other paper outside this statement and then add it up here
and after some time t4 becomes ready, it starts executing
the point is that the parameters of a transistor or in general any active device, semiconductor device, vary quite a lot
so this is our folder dialog
similarly, it will be x l into k square the way you have transformed this, that is you r l dash and that will your x l dash
yes, the other equation will tell me what is the value of this del dot d for example, rho; right, but rho may or may not be a function i mean may or may not be a function of time in the depend
so, this will imply this c theta f will cancel from both sides
this also shows the power of using h method sometimes
let say i have a clock routing problem instance
so, this will be lost definitely as some of the losses after i give certain amount of power to my machine in the form of electrical power, right
mobility is usual a function of temperature
but once heel cracking occurs and continues since the pre compression levels are low you can have significant part of the wall that undergoes cracking with a condition that you only have almost a hinge at the other end which is equilibrating
and if you have more number of scatterers, once again the time will be short
so, the symbols is f comma g and its value is given by
similarly, when it will come to this when theta is equal to 90 degree that is when theta is equal to 90 degree, then your a b is equal to i m
now starting torque t start will be 3 by omega s then i starts square into your r 2 dash because we have we have this is from that expression we have all seen that start starting torque expression, maximum torque expression, torque expression everything
i have two blocks here, two wooden blocks we can see here
so with is we will come to the end of this lecture
this is a rectangular form this form because for that addition and subtraction will be helpful, right
whereas the magnetic field intensity h does not have an equivalent quantity i would say in the electrical circuit
in the case of the integral equation method when you write a contour integral on the boundary, that one equation involves all the fields along the contour
now, governments and merchants has been using the system of transactions recording for a very long time
the third and the fourth photographs depict the gaze which is downwards
7 into 297 0
so, you see know whole lot of development that took place during those time and primarily if you realize no it is more of psychophysics, a little bit of emotions and then the intentionally was primarily to how to quantify things
so, the header files that comes from the standard library or system header files, must come, must be specified with these kinds of angular brackets
and also we have to sense the difference between certain quantities
or z is also yet another definition of z is ratio of electric to magnetic field
2 it is told that when the single angle is loaded concentrically through through one of the its leg the flexural torsional buckling strength may be evaluated using an equivalent slenderness ratio lambda e where lambda e is expressed by these expression which is lambda e is equal to square root of k1 plus k2 lambda vv square plus k3 lambda phi square so this expression you can find out in is 800:2007 clause 7
2 mm right
we will not
so the value of magnetic susceptibility of a superconducting material is minus one
voltage that results in significant amount of current to flow from source to drain
this is primarily for your own working out, but we have a class a and specialized from that we have class b, specialized from that we have class c
so, you can see that the variable name was my data that has got qualified by the namespace name
and then single flow graphs can be analysed using various methods, some of which we have discussion previous modules, the signal flow graph reduction techniques
kautilay suggested good salaries be paid to accountants as well as auditor as higher income would keep them ethical
i substitute this equation and i will have a equation for drain current; in the equation of the drain current everything is given
see, scan path is a concept but various manufactures can implements, can path in different ways
we are making the serial connection with pin number 10 and 11, and the analog port we are using a0
we have few more conditions, when the device is horizontally left
and i am going to look at a natural image right cat is a natural object, so it is also a cross section of breast tissue
in this circuit the voltmeter reading is exactly what we want, but the ammeter reading is not so
since there is a vacancy here we can actually move this to this position, the maximum value will now go to the end of the heap, but the next time we process the heap there will be only n minus one values
so, if i do something like objdump minus minus disassemble all example 1 and it would actually store the output in example 1 dot list, what this particular tool would do is that it would disassemble example 1 and store the disassembly in this file called example 1 dot list
and the second thing is: i means you normally have to identify the critical paths by looking at this slag values, the slag value
so what we have to do is we have to include the month of december also in this schedule though we have not included the month of december in the earlier two schedules because we are preparing the budget for three months the quarter starting from january till march
so, if you see the circuit and analyse, what you will do
so, ever mu r is given 1600 for this for this materials same materials this 1600 right and we know phi is equal to f m by r like your v by r
so, that is what we are going to talk about next right
and then we will see that the virtual functions are the right example of late binding, dynamic binding that we have in c++
because the drain is not in this picture we are sensing at the source and feeding back to the gate, i will connect the drain to the supply voltage
in that case, if only base 70 mm is given and tangents making 60 degrees; then how to construct a parabola which satisfies these conditions graphically
it should not be that the update equations are taking in some different directions
now let us take one example in which we need to determine the phase sequence of the set of voltages like van is equal to 200 cos omega t plus 10, vbn is given as 200 cos omega t minus 230 and vcn is given 200 cos omega t minus 110
so this is the nominal value or the operating point value which i am giving it as a feed forward term and this plus this will be this control voltage and this is d plus d hat with with even the variation that is coming due to unwanted reasons and is coming from the controller this goes into into the pwm and controls the switch
out of this combinations, one combination will denote all lines are fault free
so, this is called a mono static mono means just one right; so, one transmitter and receiver at the same location
what will happen in that case
and these are good characteristics of amplifiers
this is as it is the run time
so, what we have to do first
what would be step 2
and of course, the scale factor we have to vary because that is the thing we are trying to find
welcome to the first lecture of this course electronic materials devices and fabrication
imagine i am, i have seen my peers writing on the textbook when it is a language class; for example if it is, if the teacher is teaching a poem then probably the notes would be jotted down on top of the actual prose or the content whereas if it is a maths class he will probably have it is notes right written on a notebook, so he has brought out a good point
there is one from channel 1 to v1, second 2 volts
so if it is z1, z2, z3 the equivalent impedance if you have to find out it is better to take the reciprocal of impedances
here, you could have if set jump j buf equal to equal to 1, else something
the same point p, where we have both the front view and top view
now, in other words, you can also say that reciprocity theorem can be interpreted as when the places of voltage source and current in any network are interchanged the amount of magnitude of voltage and current flowing in the circuit remains same
so, if i know beforehand that my solution is going to look oscillatory then why choose pulse basis function or piece wise up linear
5 to 3 times; then it get a current from electrical machine you have studied that right
i just went through it and it is exactly the same as in the n mos common source amplifier
so, this is p loss and this is q loss, right
how do you resolve
we will try to understand the fact with the help of an example, so what we will do
now, let see slightly complex circuit where we have one dependent current source
however, in most modern operating systems we have access control mechanisms for files which would permit users to actually set privileges and various access control policies like read, write and execute to ensure who can read files, who can write or modify their files and who can execute corresponding programmes
now, let's see about this strategic programs
so, based on that your plus and minus variations always happen
so, inflow there are the sources of inflow cash proceeds from issuing shares or other similar instruments
and if i draw the signal flow graph diagram of this entire circuit, so we can start with the 1st, just for a 2 port network as we have seen
standard cost of the labor is 8, 2, this is 0 and then it is 9, 3, 12, so 120
so, this portions call ideal transformers, right
so, will start with aluminum gallium arsenide of band gap 2 electron volts and we have gallium arsenide band gap 1
that is also one of the reason we show it by dark continuous lines
you have to solve it numerically right
so, when that happens the control comes back here, and control comes back with minus one which certainly fails this certainly satisfies this test
some modifying factors that might be taken for differentiators are may be caused by the conditioning background and they should not be overlooked
so again i write the keywords of those examples to see, suppose i get an example of case study about tata, so there is one paragraph which is important for me for tomorrow in my exam next day
so, what we have done is we have taken total purchases which is 5 plus 3 plus 6,900 plus 8 and plus 2 from which 20,000 are issued
these are much smaller in size because the semiconductor made of solid state devices, they are very small
now this one you can move to the left by two lambda, so now the distance can be only two lambda
so we have a five bit l f s r as shown here
suppose i need to do addition
we will go for that and purchase information is given to us directly
so, this is like this and inside this i have this arrangement this spindle and the other iron bar and this one can rotate inside the coil, so this one can rotate
they will have to be added in the profit and loss account
so in that case what we can say that the power factor is cos theta
because we are already showing this 2
nowadays we find that touch is not only related to human beings only, it has got a technological extension also
and the difference in the currents that are flowing into these two transistors is amplified and the voltage across this resistance r1, is actually becoming proportional to the absolute temperature
so, this is your 4 ampere, now what is the voltage
naturally, being able to use and explicit built in type bool has a lot of advantages
so, what you will do is for your just for your own practice suppose if it is suppose something is here it is given these volt or that volt right what you can do is, for your ah this thing you find out how much power is supplied by the this is not given in the problem i have also, but i have also not solved let find out how much power is supplied by this 6 this 6 ampere ah current source, this 10 ampere current source, and this 40 volt voltage source right
we will select another part, we will click open
so there is a swing of 0 to 5m and if you take in terms of b there is a swing of 0 to bm
similarly, let us pick this point somewhere here it intersects
even though, our body language is mainly unconscious we can identify certain negative habits and learn to replace them by a more positive aspect of body language
now let us look at the research that has to do with affect regulation, the regulation of emotions
again creditors 25,000
so, i can say edge number 1 is this, edge number 2 is this, edge number 3 is here and edge number 4 comes here and finally, i have edge number 5 ok
both currents enter or leave the dotted terminals otherwise we will consider as negative
to the function generator, this is the function generator, like you can see here
what are kind of noise we will just touch the base and we will move to the next texture
so, current is flowing like this right
the learning outcomes seems fairly clear here now you need to design instructional activities that align with the learning outcome and assess the learners on the same know how would you do that
the physical problem was here this is a math problem
but when you actually measure the operational amplifier by testing this particular experiment, that is you keep inverting terminal ground, non inverting terminal ground
notice that this goes as one over four, z naught square
i think that would be the best bet with teachers
the reason union was given in c is for the fact that if you have to make an aggregate, if you have to make a container which can deal with data of variety of types, typically just to give you the kind of reference where union is used is if you think of a network connection, and you have a network port, where variety of data is coming different kinds of data packets are coming, and you do not know what kind of data packet will come out of a possible say 10 different kinds of data packets
now let us just do a one to one mapping of this, what will be the first term become
so, let me give you an example this is a
look out for the name of the exchange
this is provided for taking perforation if someone would like to staple these drawing sheets or perhaps make perforations keep a record this extra space will be used
that is the power
these are the common things that teachers, parents will say or the level of distraction is very high
so, immediately the us president send his communication consultant to china in order to find out the reason behind it
so if i am having a magnetic circuit somewhat like this, let me probably draw this like a transformer
now we want to understand how does this give rise to electric field and electrostatic potential
it also passes through this
to represent dimension, we require a dimension line
and guanine you see on the top and adenine and thymine you see at the bottom
and again, as i explained earlier, we could also have used the condition based on the source gate voltage, that is the source gate voltage should be more than the threshold voltage, but by convention we use this because we can also use this with bipolar transistors
so when we are trying to calculate something like degree of hydration, we have to be aware that at the beginning we have a sample with free water which is usually removed
5 ohm, i may end up connecting 200 300 ohms, very very large resistance
that is the permeability of the space
02 therefore the lambda we got 94
so, delta p r will be delta p l upon your p r delta p l upon delta f right into 1 upon p r
so, certainly, if we just refer back once, poornima will neither use this main, nor will use this main, because she has to integrate both of this codes
so i am going to have two fields in the air gap just like what i had in the case of an induction machine as well
so, when you are showing isometric views; if it is most important, then only we will show these kind of centerlines, otherwise we should not show them
that you really don't know exactly what the strength is or you don't have the means of going and identifying what the strength of the material in the existing structure is
now the second contribution, let's write it as a b displacement
so, those are those n, on the boundary i have my h z and e tan both are undetermined
in this assignment, we will focus on the general interaction and in the next one we will take a problems related to the specific devices which i just mentioned
now, i had to see how the rate of change of current or the current change occurs in the enhancement type mosfet
this is a very attractive way of describing the dependency of the function that we want to compute the value that we are trying to compute on smaller values, and it gives us a handle on how to go about computing it
i am just trying to compare different configurations
school with infrastructure and school without the said infrastructure
so, the reason for this will become sort of clear as we go along in this course, but this is a popular way of replacing an object by current sources magnetic and electric ok
so, it has decayed and there is no reflection right
in next session, we will discuss more about the other elements
so, let us start our discussion before going into the detail lets first understand what we discussed when we were discussing about the laplace transform
c strings are actually a collection of functions in string dot h header, which allow us to manipulate strings in c
so we again have an open circuit looking into port 2 which means there is no current division
but the original idea was let us try and stop corrosion altogether
so that is one point
now, i will just bring out this terminal, this is the other terminal, this is the third terminal so i am going to call this as this will be connected to a phase voltage, this will be connected to b phase voltage, this will be connected to c phase voltage, right
so, normally when we say or we mean 1 or the other
if we want to construct any other plane, for example, let us pick the geometry box vertical plane is 90 degrees with the horizontal
in this case here, vp and ip are the phase voltages and phase currents and vp and ip is the magnitude of the voltages and currents
the maximum value is 220 into root 2
so, now the ammeter reading we want this to be close to i sc or same as i sc ideally and that will be true only if
as if i am pinching off
5 ah inductor both are in parallel right and this voltage is say v so that means, r i y will be this same voltage across a 2 ohm resistor, so it is v by this 2 ohm resistance right
so, what is the location of the source point x prime y prime z prime, what is the location of the observation point 0 0 z right
so, as expected we would see in mylib is 100 and the value of log is 5555
and therefore, avoiding all these materials or content that you add, enhances your learning for your students and this makes it much more easier for them to be able to understand the content easier
what you call e 1 and e 2 voltage basically you can say this is the ideal transformer in this voltage
i will just show you some of the features of this board first and then what are the steps that are required to actually interface with arduino
now, since the profits have increased, but they have doubled the dividend
there is a domain ah registration service, where you can go like private link manages it you can get it as long as you keep renewing the name you can have it
again same thing fewest number of hidden lines we have to pick
so, if you quickly see back, we can find value of f l and from that we have f l is given
so, what is iem
so far, we have been analyzing some of the parameters used to characterize the linearity of a circuit, but let us now see some of the methods in which how we can improve the linearity
the other one minor axis is at 40 mm
so, i will have va rated, greater than va1, greater then va2, greater than va3 and so on
we have q v
04 ampere
it is delta is equal to 0
so, you may have seen this earlier
so, z s is the source impedance or internal impedance and z r is the or impedance connected at the end of the line and figure 11 b, t is the time for a wave to travel the line length
so, this is your q l this much of the reactive load reactive power required in the load
the damper will not have any action when the speed is synchronous speed, whenever the speed is different from synchronous speed the damper bars are definitely going to get induced currents, depending upon how much is the difference in the speed between the rotor speed and the revolving magnetic fields speed
so i am essentially going to have this as a constant this will not change
so, this is your near field consideration now not surprisingly that the other thing that we should look at is
even fem we can implement pml and people have done so ok
we have discussed in the last module what does single pole mean and what you mean by first order what you mean by second order low pass filters and now we will see the high pass filters here as single pole r c filter that is only 1 r, 1 c, you can generate a voltage across this resistor and then you can see that because it is single pole rc or first order rc filter it has a role off rate of 20 db per decade it is a role of rate of 20 db per decade
so, irms square into r this is that your what you call that average power in the resistor that is irms square into r
profit to volume ratio as the name indicates helps us to understand the profitability or the profit potential of any product
i need to solve the problem, solving problem in presence of dielectric
so factory cost incurred in this case is how much
81, the ratio has fallen particularly from march 16 and then it has become stagnant
bank loan payable will also come down
so, this is that simple plot for impedance verses your omega, this is omega, this is impedance right
so, because total cost is considered, so if you are not able to manufacture the sizeable amount of the volume, you are not able to sometimes sustain in the market
even in this case when we are connecting series resistance at the input and the shunt resistance at the output any one of the two has to be done
but for a dielectric the field does penetrate inside and we want to calculate how much is this field
96 meter that is this one we just got know this one just hold on, this 65 this is this is x 1, this is 248 meter this 372, this is d 1 and this is your 19
so, ec against ec we write minus 1 by l and against i t we write minus r by l
you might ask me here these are talk about stability circle in the boundary between stability and instability then why are we discussing about this smith chart with its unit circle
net displacement on the left hand side is y i plus y r and its vertical component is going to be theta again, which is d by d x of this times the tension, that's the net force on the left hand side
so positive, negative, negative goes back to d 1, so like a flow chart, ok fine
so similar to what we had done in the earlier case
and you can see obviously it is reducing
it is a short term buffer where verbal rehearsal takes place
so, these are 2 criteria that will give you the desired result that you are seeking in this problem
so, that means, this one is 10 and this one is 8
this is a capacitor c and a load r not, but now we have put a resistive load
and this part is known as the gate overdrive voltage
we will look at the process of what happens when an object reaches the end of it is lifetime or it is time to destruct
then this construction has to happen, the object d 1 of class d has to; if this has to happen then this constructor gets called, which in turn means that this constructor gets called
the equivalent circuit is like this
so, this is the end of this particular module
first let us look at a hard real time system
it has got 8 to 32 kb flash and the clock speed can range from 10 to 80 mhz
3 in the bracket that you see there, 2
so, if you look at this particular small function over here which essentially creates the stack frame, it pushes the stack frame pointer, ebp on to the stack that corresponds to this and then there is a changing of stack frame that is the current stack pointer is moved to base pointer and then the stack pointer is decremented by 16 bytes to give space for the local variables
in this course, so far for the majority of the course what we have discussed are the pedagogical design principles to address learner cognitive engagement and learning when we are designing e learning
any further questions
the waveguide has to be basically designed to produce an impedance matching
hidden corrosion hidden corrosion is happening
now, if someone would like to start showing the dimensions it becomes bit clumsy, it becomes very clumsy
so, this is the use of this yee cell alright
a gives the current i through that surface and direction is in the direction of the current
so, what assert gives you is there is a manifest constant and debug
then i can write 7
so, where does it make sense, it make sense for the observer standing out here, who can see an incident field and can compare with and without object right, that is the physical meaning of scattered field, if the observe
the third thing is to describe the scope of the search
it is attractive rather than intense when it is accompanied by other softer facial expressions and a smiles and with more relaxed body movements
so this corresponds to all active devices and this corresponds to all passive devices
next we will look at a p type impurity or a p type dopant
this figure i have taken from is 800 2007
so, this circuit it this is the circuit and this can be represented as this is an rc circuit, this can be represented as that is v s u t that is; source voltage is this is your what you call this switch is closed
if we are looking at this, perhaps this curve forms an ellipse
so it is like a divide and concur problem
so, we bifurcate into two variable and fixed
4, let me just extend this a bit and you have 0
and how the manufacturing sector firms can make use of this particular source of the funds, i have refer to use sometimes back about the factors that factors are the firms who buy the say credit sale ledger or who handle the not buy would who handle the credit sale ledgers of any manufacturing sector firms
high context culture is based on long term relationships, high context is formal and implies meaning and you have to look for the body language
so, the end point is this
so 50% weight is to how much utilization of the cpu occurred in the previous times lies and the rest half is the history of cpu uses previous to the j minus 1 instant
so, i have done this in a field in a class in italy
to summarize the three main questions that we need to keep in mind are what do i want my learners to learn, what teaching and learning activities should i create to make learners achieve the intended learning outcomes and what assessment task will inform that learners have achieved the intended learning outcomes
so, what we will do is that we will not just terminate the tree with the value and the two pointers none you will actually add a layer of empty nodes with all fields none with this the empty tree will be a single empty node and a leaf node that is not none will have a value and both it is children will be empty nodes
so, right now what we see is we can change the voltage we i am increasing the voltage and correspondingly i can see the increase in the voltage here on my multimeter
so, b is equal to mu into f m upon l weber per meter square or tesla either or mu this is the unit
so this clock is coming, so i am clocking them with [vocalized noise] half the frequency f by two and this final multiplexer which is going out, that will be taking the data from here and also here and generating output at a clock frequency of f
but once i want to implement the body of the reverse string function when i want to use the stack operations naturally i will need to know what that stack definition actually is
so, here gk are the lowpass prototype and ck are the final values for the high pass prototypes with certain z0 and omega c, they need not be equal to 1 ohms and 1 radians per second
now, let us see when you have the multiple input, output that means we have a multivariable system, how we will find out the transfer function
now we can go back and set dhawan's score in the first test to 76 and may be you can set the second test to 27 and maybe we can set kohliõs score in the first test to 200
the output of this command is the got table for this particular function, note that the contents at an offset of 16 bytes is c203 which in little indian notations stands for 0x3c2
so, these are finite dimensional vector spaces, to characterize vector space, what does the most sort of basic building block
so, if you increase the value of photocurrent, so if iph is higher, voc will increase
but when we talk about clock and power, it is not like that
so, this says that i can just bring it already on one side f prime of over here, so what all terms will have when i add it over here
especially, in manufacturing industries solidworks and autocad are the popular choices
assume that these variables and fixed expenses require cash disbursements each month
so, i showed you the linear portion
similarly, for y if you see, if you hold it this way, the y value will be maximum; and if you hold it in this way, the y value will be minimum
i am not writing equal
so, it means that you need sometimes the power calculation to find out how much power you have consumed at that particular instant and then when you will multiply with the time duration you will come to know how much energy you have consumed
so, in that in that case, your field current i f remain constant because, nothing is connected here because, this voltage v is remains constant
and naturally the project costs increase and there is project delays
so, we have four tasks a, b, c, d and each task, sorry, each job the task instance is defined by the computation time required
then we can also return true
now this is an application which was amended or in a particular date, the form there is provisional complete depending on which who you use, you will strike off the other
the name of this mask is dark field mask
if you do so, but for an ideal transformer the reactance is look at the assumptions whatever made in force the reactance r is equal to your 0, right
suppose, if the load capacitance is two point five femto farads, then with your smallest gate, a, your delay will be thirty five picoseconds
so, the number of circuits that you see, this i alluded to in the introductory lecture also, is very large, because you can take a whole bunch of operating point setups, whole bunch of functionalities and combine them together
004173 right
so, there is no actual shorting between vn and v p not here not even through the i mean logically in nothing there inside the op amp because ideally, no current goes like this or this because here the current is 0 here the current is 0
we just show a function here, please do not become concerned about the functionality of this the algorithm for this simply take two parameters adds them and returns them just look at the definition of this function here, and it has two parameters both int int a and int b
so, it will be multiplied into rho s; that means, will be rho s square rho r square into v f; rho s rho r rho s rho r square v f is already there and again it will be reflected should be rho s square rho r square v f
what we will do in this module we will continue to discuss about or detailed understanding of static and dynamic binding; and with that, we will introduce what is known as a polymorphic type in c++
take some point, or let's take a strip
gradient
so, we will start with an example, and slowly illustrate each of these points over the next couple of slides
so, in this case we have found out the fuel cost for the three levels taking the 8 million worth of the revenue as the base
so very perfect allows you for lot of inter operating, inter operating with different environments
so, the point that i was making is, now this oscilloscope has several functions, with this oscilloscope also has it
so, it is also known sometimes we call as a delta function, in it in a book you will find this unit impulse function also is termed as delta function, right
so, in that case it will not be a just not like a straight line
so, that is the small boundary modification for equation 1
the two other cases are when you are actually running in the enclave mode and you are trying to access data within the enclave or trying to access data which is outside the enclave so both of this should be permitted by the processor
it is said that in the learning curve 83% is dependent on our side, 11% on hearing and 6% on other senses
so the mean value will be calculated based on the measurements using these four different, all four faces of the concrete
how do i decipher, that this is a real quiet child, calm, quiet, composed child or the child is forced to be quiet because, i have not been permissive
so, that something that we have to be careful about, but before we get into those details is let us be conceptually very clear what is happening
this dimension must have been already given in the drawing as intricate detail
so, for example, we already this is an expression which is we have calculated several times the field that any r as per huygens principle
so, stronger the advertising campaign, it helps the company to stay in the market rather to grow with the sales
so we will take the data of net sales and let us divide it by number of shares
it does not change with time as the instantaneous power of each phase does
disadvantage of using a breadboard compared to the smaller breadboard
so, let us take one example
so, if it is a real time system means this an embedded software
) now one important thing from the attacker’s perspective is the return address, if the attacker could somehow fill this buffer 2 in such a way that he would cause a buffer overflow and modify this particular return address then let us see what would happen
well because if epsilon r were a function of space then technically speaking i may not get a plane wave like solution over there
so the important thing which you have to remember is that how you will find out the polarity of mutual voltage
this is what between this ah voltage and current, this is angle pi or the peak peak difference this angle this difference is phi, right
so you have got, given an initial set of points, you have got a tree embedding which will ensure the ensure that the lengths of all the arms are equal in sizes, because the way you are calculating the means and medians, this will be ensured
so, here r thevenin is 80 8 ohm right
again, the same base class there is no difference i have not changed it
all these things will be written on the name plate details of the machine normally, right
we should write it bigger
so, let me just plot log of mu versus dopant concentration
so it means against that 700,000s, only say 70,000 worth of the sales are on cash
then c calculatede series and parallel resonant frequencies
now we have started the test, the test is running
therefore, the capacitor was un charged at t is equal to minus infinity
so whenever we say that the voltage in our house is 230 volts it implies that you are talking about the rms value not the peak value
so the effective depth of the web we are going to find as 2952 mm
so, this paper shows the implementation of a ring oscillator puf vertex 4 fpga, so they compared 15 such devices, all of these devices are exactly identical and they implemented 1024 ring oscillators in each fpga, this means that the n over there was 1024
next part is that d; d it is given effective load acting on conductor in kg per meter
this is gradient of divergence of b, which is zero, minus laplacian of b is equal to mu zero, epsilon zero d by d t of minus d b d t
but then you might be wondering at this point that why is that the traditional operating systems like unix have such a high task preemption time of a second or something
so, now, if we know that the internal resistance of this meter is call this is 99 ohm is given call it r a meter resistance or call it r m, m for meter
so, in that case the scheduler will choose the highest priority foreground task
rotor copper loss will be s p g, so s we know, p g we know
so, but question is put the put the kvl in the first equation it will be, 5 plus j 5 into i 1 plus i 2, because here this is that your i 2 and this is the i 1
so, this is a dependent current source this is i 0 is equal to say 2 into i x say 2 is it is 2 i have taken it may be 3 4 less than 1 whatever it is it does not matter right, but further purpose of explanation say it is 2 into i x
can the integral sign move anywhere ok
now all these localized defect states can also take part in conduction, they can essentially trap the electrons and holes
all these books are available right in your library also all these books will be available
that’s not an interesting proposition for the person who is touching him, a conflict of interest if you will
so this is the 45 minus this 20,000 final net difference of the in the profit has been seen here is that is the 25,000 rupees
when you take the series capacitor rather than kilowatt you have to consider that your reactance of the your what you call that ah series capacitor
so, an 8 pole, 50 hertz, 3 phase induction motor has an equivalent rotor resistance of 0
inductor
but most people when they grow their mind as they learn, they get out of this fear natural fears
so, once again you have p side on the n side
the c means that the standard library header is coming from the c standard library and the other difference is you drop the dot h extension to the file name that existed in c, you just call it cmath
there are situations in which python allows declarations, but there are many other things where it could allow declarations and make things more usable, but it does not and this is one example
so when we want to realize an amplifier we have to set the operating point in this region, in the saturation region
suppose this is your branch, this is one, this is two
so, they make a point here that because, they turned on the field abruptly right
r will be zero because there is no anything produce here, and this gives you v
so, and 4 i s c means expression of i s c we have got it here, here you have to [sub/substitute] substitute; that means, it will be 4 into 12 minus v 2 upon 4 effectively, it will become 12 minus v 2 and this i should be is equal to v 2 by 3
with respect to routability
so you import the material, make sure that we have to ensure the quality of the product and we will have to reduce the cost of production
so, equation 20 that means, this equation 20 as well you are following important properties of an inductor can be noted like capacitor also we solve some property
a sphere of radius some r right
so what this says is, use comma to separate so if at the end of this i had got like last time 6, 7 and 8, then this will now put them back as 6 comma 7 comma 8 into a single string
so we are not just talking one course but actually bouquet of courses
numerical ability again a 25 item test, again time given is 20 minutes and it looks at you are ability to comprehend and deal with number related concepts
so f are all sub matrices, f a a are sub matrices what will be the size of for example this or this
so, you could have a situation where tau is equal to c plus mu sigma initially, then the bond is lost, c goes to zero, tau is then the residual shear stress, shear strength that you have in the masonry is nothing but tau into mu sigma
very good etching selectivity between si and sio2 using hf
now, when you take and you do a bit by bit, end of this, two vectors: one one, one, one one, and one zero, one, one one
so, this ae line might be elongated 1, and this ab line might be shorten, because we are looking from left side, left side view what we have on the profile plane
so, we will see why we called that finite difference time domain
so, the learners feel that maybe they are in the wrong place now
so, you have a magnet say, suppose it is revolving right and it is surrounded by your static part called stator
the reason is that if you compare it with the average power we calculated we got the term of theta v minus theta i
so, he would see that i will first supply to the 1 who is making with the prompt payment
we will have v, g, s here
i hope you are getting what is item number c
as we saw earlier, the electronic configuration of the outer shell of silicon is 3 s2 3 p2
so, let us take a definite case again this is my boundary and i am showing you one yee cell ok
so, this is the op amp now here the advantage is that that i can change the amplification factor by changing the value of rf and r i another point is whatever the i introduced phase my output at the op amp that is here, i will have a 180 degree phase shift because it is a inverting amplifier
so, the current may flow say like this entering through this and then going round and round like this and then here it will go in the opposite direction round and round and then it goes out ok
to interpolation of the data given in the table, we can find out the fcd value as 11156 newton per millimeter square
for example, i want to keep it to this end
so, similarly you can see the only terms that are going to be non zero in this in this equation will be what which us will be non zero in this will appear in this
now, you we we have to here here also we have to understand certain things
023 times 10 to the 23
number one it will go to the raw material consumed, it will come here and then the direct wages information will be here
so, this is known to me i am going to call this the it like the incident field because it has information about the current source, what comes out from a current source some incident field which is going to get scattered right
the only way this can become zero is if n equals one and this implies e should go as one over r
so, and a dependent or controlled voltage source is similar to an independent source, except that the voltage across the source terminals is a function of other your what you call other voltages or current in the circuit for example, look
direct acyclic graph means ah graph where every edges has an arrow
so, total is, we have the value 600, 400; when you substitute, we get the value of quality factor q equals to minus 3
most of a basic communication signals are the same all over the world
equals may touch each other within the justifiable socially acceptable touch behavior
op amp based low pass filter means it is an active filter
so now when you see kirchhoff’s current law means you have to convert this capacitor into equivalent s domain
you will get a very rough idea
basically we are looking at the impedance being transferred from one side to the other side to whichever side the destination side should be coming on the numerator, the number of turns of the destination side should come on the numerator and from where i am transferring should come on the denominator, so i should have n1 by n2 whole square as the transfer parameter when i am trying to transfer the impedance from the secondary side into the primary side, fine
colors also have certain customary associations
so bell lapadula model defines three different properties, it defines no read up or also known as the simple security property or the ss property, it also defines a second property known as no write down or the star property and finally it defines discretionary security property which mediates every access based on the access matrix, so let us look at what these two policies are no read up and no write down essentially with no read up this is what happens, let us say you have a subject with a clearance level of confidential, so with no read up it would mean that this subject cannot read any objects having a high classification level, so for example this subject will not be able to read any secret objects or any top secret objects, on the other hand this subject which has a clearance levels of confidential can read all the objects which are classified as confidential as well as all the objects which are unclassified, thus we see that information flow is only restricted from a lower classification level to a higher classification level and not vice versa
5 and we connect an inductor in shunt as shown
and here for enum, i can give a special semantics, i can give a new semantics for my type, while the underline type, you may continuous to remain to be unbuilt in integer
so, this is the value of the output voltage when the circuit is given to you
now, the unit area which we just saw in case of this expression the value of unit area is called as a strength of the impulse function
so, let us look back at our equation over here
if you try to satisfy these budgets at every point in the circuit and whenever we see that there is a some kind of a violation, you try to take some corrective steps
the same model of producer not being in direct contact with the consumer continues to be an important thing, quite similar to that of mqtt
so, this is the head similarly here is the head and here you have the hind limb
so to examine the overall contours of these values, if you represent what this table tells you in terms of the relationship between allowable shear f
i will give it this multi tenancy feature, which is not possible in mqtt
you double click that left mouse to quickly open a file or folder
so, for the op amp when you talk about electronics a positive feedback will cause oscillation or generate oscillations and negative feedback will lead to stability ok
so, slowly the value is getting decreased, now i am putting little more hand
so those will be represented just like what we did in the case of magnetic circuit analysis for sinusoidal excitation
finally, we saw the photograph of how the engineer is loading the wafer inside the horizontal tube furnace
so, sometimes i wonder sitting in my clinic also the kids who were brought whether parents unconsciously obviously or consciously they would not do it; unconsciously they are just taking their kids behavior, the report card of the kid as one of their social status symbol inadvertently
we have used a small dc motor as an example to show you how this kind of interfacing can be done
it means whatever the purchases we are making in the month of june, we will make the payment for that in the month of july
5 ohms simply as a resistance, then i can assume it is in phase, it does not matter, i2 angle 0, right
it has got a failure plane that is formed at the bottom because of tensile cracking but equilibrium is maintained by this hinge at at o itself
so, for independent sources should be turned off to get your r thevenin
so, let us see a simple resistive power divider
the output of one gate is driving another gate
on the other hand if i have a static declaration, then if i say that i is an integer and j is an integer and k is an integer then the compiler can directly declare in advance some space in the memory to be reserved for i, j and k
so what this says is that suppose i have introduced a buffer in a circuit and the input signal it is not very good, it has become like this
that is why we use soft baking
if we increase the number of poles will it help in starting
all these are possible
96590; this we have seen it, when you are doing the load flow method of the first method right only from this results are taking from the first method after second iteration
and when i construct the print job object, then i know what are the number of pages that need to be printed in this job
so, if i increase v d s, my v d will increase and correspondingly my i d will increase
so, if output is already positive then compare input with can you guess
later on, in this course we will be actually looking how these attacks are actually developed
27 ohm right
and the dependent sources are also available
so, first it is the how we calculate those purchases and how we have to use it
so, geometrically, i have argued that the net force will be in the z direction
with this that ah that application of capacitors to distribution system ah everything is covered now, right, so after that we will go to the load frequency control chapter
what is it there that they are considered best
now what is next step
now of course in this course we won't go through that we just assume that the solution can be found somehow
there is one machine
so, it turns out that you will see that dictionaries are actually something that make python a really useful language for manipulating information from text files or tables, if you have what are called comma separated value tables, it is taken out of spreadsheet because then we can use column headings and accumulate values and so on
so, this can be used in two different ways and i have shown you detailed connection with power supply etcetera everything ok
evanescent waves
now, we have to locate the remaining points like 1, 2, 3 and so on 7 points on the semicircle because we would like to construct an octagon of 8 equal sides
so, here is your epsilon r here is your sigma and that is your s z
so, my v 1 will become 5 into 3 that is your 15 volt right
so, next process would be to deposit gold on top of this silicon dioxide, right
alpha to the power n minus 1 right, the last term on the right hand side
let us have a look at this waveform by simulating the circuit and probably you can also do the simulation and find out the way forms of other parts of the circuit and ensure that they work similar to the lossy flux reset type of forward converter also
a what remember this is one boundary one edge along the boundary right and then there is going to be another edge and then there is going to be another edge like this there are how many such edges
in the other direction we have calcium ions, sodium ions, potassium ions because they are positive ions they move away from the positive towards the negative
so, we can start at the end of the list and work backwards
now can we solve it
now, if i have this material, if i have this machine element; can you guess offset section at different planes
any chamfers, we represent including that chamfering lens using these continuous lines
so, if one way to look at extracting this code, taking it to a laboratory and then conducting a compression test on the cylinder extracted, then you would realize that the direction of loading with respect to the bed joints is 90 degrees different to what the actual structure is subjected to
so, now, the celebration part also began, 2008 when the statement on the role of psychologists in international emergencies was released by the american psychological association
one is the firm who is a manufacturer then the sales force who is employed by the firm and third one is the channel or maybe the final customer so these are the three levels
that is what an impulse current is the current is of very high value, it is almost infinity theoretically, but it exists for a very short duration
so, we will close it over here
so, we will replace e c plus chi with infinity
there are some other design rules which are also augmented, which are based on some absolute values, not based on lambda any more
so, this is one of the easiest and simplest way how you can obtain collagen
8 2 and 0
if you remove the current source the updated circuit will be like shown in the figure and now, across terminal a b we apply a current source having value 3 ampere
but suppose if you are asked to find out the rms value how you will find that we will discuss in the next class and then we will continue with our discussion on mesh and nodal analysis
1; so, i could choose some points like this right
so, it means whatever the total amount we are paying decrease is how much is decrease means paying back to the bank, increase means borrowing from the bank
n element number is 2 left or right
so you want that to be the only content and but you want also students to sort of, let be editor, is not that what your original idea was
this is what python calls a slice
suppose i i have this rectangular region where these are the blocks: this is one block, this is one block, this is a block and this is a block
why did i move this term to the right hand side
its divergence is equal to three charge in the system and its curl is not zero and it is related to to and and we have calculated some ah displacement for certain examples
these four refer to some storage cells again, which are connected among themselves
this is a nested call, two level nesting i am demonstrating
very clearly, if it is an air core transformer even the no load current will be very large, i hope you understand
so, you can keep this distance and you can keep this angle
i will get a 0 i will get a 2 j omega t it is not possible for me to get a e to the j omega t right you can just intuitively see it immediately
similarly, with respect to that point this point is at 20 units location
so, adjust the scale carefully and draw a parallel line
so, here when we have derived the method of moments equation over here, we did not have this weighted residual interpretation right, we just said phi is projected on basis b then i do testing along t m that was my interpretation we were happy with it
in many applications the conducting plates may be aluminum foil right the that conducting plates may be aluminum foil and the insulating material between the conducting plates, we called a dielectric right
95137 angle 0
so, what is l 1
similarly, for load 2 problem is twisted right , here it is q 2 is equal to 45 kvar is given you have to obtain p
so it will become minus 100
so, ultimately it will given 60 degree and if you divide i 1 by i 2, it will be 5 by 2 angle 0 degree and 10 by 2 angle 60 degree
thus what we see is that the file which was created by subject a and meant to be read only by subject b the information in that file also passes to other subjects like c who was not supposed to have actually got the information from that file, so essentially the main drawback of discretionary access policies is that it is not concerned with information flow, it cannot do checks to prevent subject b from copying the contents of this particular file to another subject, in this particular lecture we look at the stronger form of access control based on information flow policies, with these policies it will prevent subject b from passing on the information to any other subject
no sorry it’s here, before the first section, this is where the gamma in is
the upshot of all this is that once the data is analysed by an expert it takes 6 to 12 months to provide an answer because again if you are looking waiting for this concrete to expand in the sulphate solution it is a slow process, how do you simulate this or how do you simulate other conditions of the field in the lab
multi threading support, real time file system support for supporting pre allocated and contiguous files must be supported
if, we are rotating this entire prism on horizontal plane we will see it like a triangle, when we are projecting that this point always with the edge
once it is done, name a, b, e, f, c, o, d, h, g
there is a special register r14 which is called the link register
so in this case your average power would be 0
similarly, all the flux produced by the stator will not link with the rotor, so i am going to have some amount of leakage
and then the next step: i write this as one half i integral curl of a, where a is the vector potential
finally, i will have a strong advice that please, i mean once you get a custom to overloading operators i have often seen particularly the young programmers they try to overload all operators that are available to be overloaded
and in 1883, he was a french telegraph engineer
so, to obtain that we have to protect the photoresist on this 2 area right, so, our photoresist should be protected in this two areas and from other area photoresist we have to etch out that we can do when we use negative photoresist with a bright field mask correct with a bright field mask
we have seen that in the presence of rtti, the typeid operator can actually find out the dynamic type of a pointer an object and if that is on a polymorphic hierarchy
\ a non fixed feature space is informal and dynamic when a person varies the spatial features of setting or inter personal distances
and then in the next class, in the next lecture, we will see how the opamp can be used as a filter, whether it is a passive filter,or it is an active filter and there are several type of filter that we will be discussing in the next lecture
that tip this speed of this lightning it is not the speed of the light, but its speed will be 1 into 10 to the power 5 meter per second to 2 into 10 to the power 5 meter per second general
ok, so this delay will be not just t p but u times t p, because the charging and discharging will take u times more, because the capacitance value will be u into c in
so, to apply the state variable analysis to our circuit analysis method we follow the following three steps
increase of load frequency deviation is this much daily basis is equal to minus 0
we've been looking at the electric feel and associated quantities in dielectric medium
where, we saw the summary of rules of what we can do for operators
the technological capability to track and individuals movements had been there for a very long time now, but this idea that computers can look at the individual people gestures in a crowd and can make detections on it is basis is a revolutionary concept
i could have taken more, but we are just trying to look at the whole thing
so, τe is essentially 119
so i am showing some rows of this standard cells in a typical design
it is seen that depending on the genders people interpret the space and its intervention by people belonging to different genders in different manners
as we see there is r and c
find the full load slip and speed
this is all we have in our small signal model now
so, think of the word exceptional
the impulse is over here
if you rearrange what you will get
if two or whatever i said i have written for you here, if two are generating units with drooping governor characteristic are connected to a power system there must be unique frequency at which they will share a load change
there are many ways of setting the operating points and many ways of getting the function
so, the cost which is getting affected by increasing or decreasing in the production, that is the variable cost
if i subtract this, i should get the right answer and that's my answer
so just because you apply a voltage input and take a voltage output output output, it doesn't mean this is a voltage controlled voltage source
so, i 3 is equal to writing here, i 3 is equal to this is b 1 by 4, actually b 1 minus 0 by 4 that is your b 1 by 4, because this 4 ohm resistances here, right
but after the opening up of the telecom sector for the private sector participation to see where the bsnl is
so, all types of questions might not be answered using these two dominant analytical tools, the anova and regression
so, if you take the derivative v 2 will become 100 cosine 400 t right
this energy stored in the capacitor that that is your what you call half cv square or half c q square right
infringement technically means trespass is getting into the property of someone else
then let us do one more problem
so, gold is 2
gap is by 650 hours because had the power been there in the plant for all the times, in that case the total gap would have been 8650
so, on the whole the machine will have a revolving magnetic field physically created it because of the rotor magnets
so, in this way you can easily find out the value of currents of those are the branch currents in this case and you can solve the circuit
first, one is the weighted sum of the estimated length of the all nets
so, we take m and subtract n from m, so correspondingly we subtract b d from a d
so it is important to look into factors which influence early age expansion, right
and these projection lines supposed to get matched
the other way is the point is here
currents are same magnitude balance 33
it can be for your corporate life for your career because you will be evaluated on financial performance
now, this cannot be a solution because the 2 initial conditions which we saw that is i at time t is equal to 0 and di by dt at time t is equal to 0 cannot be satisfied with single constant a3
and not only positive but greater than the negative of the negative real part of z 1 1 or z 2 2 so since the negative of the negative real part will be positive that’s why we can write this equation write this so then what is that you know writing in a different way will also we can say that the real parts since the real part of zs or zl should be greater than the modulus of z 1 1 or z 2 2 the locus of gamma s and gamma l can be expresses in this form
we will soon replace it with the moss transistor
so chinese researchers have developed this formula
so, this is the expression that we derived, all the values are essentially known e and h are also given
it is very similar to what we did in the case of a dc machine
so, we you know we draw it with a triangle ok
so, if we are measuring this angle this is 90 degrees and this angle is also 90 degrees
so the outline of the lecture is first we will look at why the corrosion is significant, why we really need to worry about it and then looking at some mechanisms of chloride induced corrosion especially in concrete structure and then critical service life parameters and 2 parameters which we will be looking at mainly is chloride diffusion coefficient and the chloride threshold
so we now solve problem number six which says: consider a long cylinder with its axis on the z axis
different, you know what are the challenges or
and then we go for the unskilled
7 volts and r is 5 kilo ooms, okay, so vd0 turns out to be about 0
so, it is actually this is the reflected wave
we use the higher quantity of the material a against the standard input of the material a of 800 kgs
now, you can see it the further the next one actuates and as in the ratio 1 is to 1
and this is of course usually numerical
but under responsibility accounting different departments, different units and subunits of the firm contributing into the production of the product, we started calling them independent responsibility centers and those independent responsibility centers were given the clear cut responsibility that this part of the product you will manufacture
so, given our previous experience with maxwell’s equations is tempting to always replace the d by d t by a j omega, but we should remember not to do that
we write it as arr i on the right, it is a vector of int we use the same indexing notation to access the array elements
so, v ab will be equal to this current 10 milliampere multiplied by r m meter resistance which is 10 milliampere multiplied by 99 ohm so, this will be the voltage between these two points
so, that is why this scheme is called a leapfrog integration scheme leapfrog integration ok
he brought that, he bought that product in millions of units and brought it to india, started assembling those, converting that into a color tv
on the top, we have cursor right
so, 1st question is, what is noise
similarly, from b, i will try to construct on the other side one more arc with the same radius from a; again, construct another arc
let us say it is made up of a metal and it is a solid metal, so the currents can go in all sorts of directions there
so, this side is w in terms of micro joule and this time you are this time is your x axis is your time second, if you plot it is 4 t square up to this and then that your what you call that your other part in between t greater than 1 less than infinity
the seven consideration is rated to the width of the vias or the lines
so, this is your v 1 minus v 2 is equal to minus 2 or v 2 minus v 1 is equal to 2, right
because, if you look into that, there is no and this capacitor is charged at ah your what you call at 100 volt right and when it will be and when it will be your what you call at t tends to infinity, that all the energy will be dissipated in the resistor
these two faults are from g two
so, this is a test that is typically used to understand how durable is your brick that you have chosen for construction and the value or the parameter that indicates how good the brick unit is referred to as the saturation coefficient is a ratio that is calculated, a ratio that is calculated by the weight of the brick after the 5 hour water absorption test to the weight of the brick before the water absorption test
so, for example, if i want to figure it out where this f line or arc might be going; first of all p point is known, locate q, and it has to pass through these lines
as you will see in our next lecture that the traditional operating systems, they keep on changing task priorities
so, the electrons move along this path of the steel reinforcement to a new side which we call the cathode, so where it is corroding is actually called an anode and the other side, because it is like a battery, we need to have 2 poles
see in this equation; what we have written
and just write it , cosine of it is angle of theta v b n is 120 degree , and angle of i b is 93
so, the same line, we are showing it here
so, the position of ec and ev does not change because both of them correspond to silicon, so the band gap is maintained
so, power factor in the second case initial is 0
c++ has tried making this far more uniform and far more type consistent, so that your type always remains correct
so, balance sheet on 31 march 2020
so, if i asked you to simply this what how would you write down real part of a complex number
so, what is 1 henry
let us look at other example
the question is will it still behave like an amplifier will it be the case that v o is equal to v 1 multiplied by some constant, like we had previously
so, there is quite a lot of record keeping involved in when it comes to filing ips and as the ip portfolio of a university grows then it would also require you to have some tools like software to manage this
so it will be decaying with the l by r time constant exponentially
it is only using a call by reference
let us see once again, it can be made identical with high reliability
so, this is a method which we published and can be used now to quantify the different kind is of fly ashes and also to measure their degree of hydration in fact
differentiations are the modifications of verbal utterances which occur independently, but are never devoid of the interpretations associated with language they include sound constructs such as laughter, crying etcetera
so, what will be the potential here
so, if you remember the definition of the effective density of states is the total number of states per unit volume that is available for the electron to occupy or the hole to occupy
5 volt 2
you can have the relative strength between the bed joint shear strength, the flexual compression strength of masonry and the tensile strength of masonry
so this would be observed by an increase in the execution time for that iteration in the spy process and thus the attacker can infer that the victim process has accessed that portion of memory and from that could infer that the key value is either 0xaa or something very close to 0xaa
so, this is nothing, but the ratio of the recombination rate which is radiative to the total recombination
now, look this switch was closed for long time, hence before s 2 is closed the capacitor is fully charged
so, this is the genre there is a plot there is an even that happens and there are a set of characters all looking suspicious and there is a person who would come to solve that thing and eventually they could be some twist in the tale, eventually the crime is solved or at least the person who reads the novel is given an impression that he got he was a part of a process of solving something
if you look into any problem related to sulphate attack, delayed ettringite formation, even in this case when you have early age expansion
but now to approximate f double prime i need 3 values of f earlier i needed 2 values ok
reference does not need that because it is, if it exists, then it is alias of something or it does not exist
the first topology we already talked about this is the clock tree
that means i 1 actually is equal to i 2 is equal to i by 2, because whatever current is entering at this point, it will half of the current of half of i will go here half of i will go here
because, this black line depends on v 2, because this black line is supposed to cross the x axis, at the point of v 2; so, if i change v 2 this black line will move towards the left or right i will show you like this ok
this takes care of the borrow during subtraction operation
vd is nothing but v 1 minus v2
so in this module we will be just we will proceeding just like in the same way that we proceeded for the gain circles that is to design that is to design a circuit having a particular value of transducer gain, unilateral case or the operating power gain of the available power gain
it is a vital aspect of non verbal communication though still not much work has been done in this area
our standard practice is we do not show these dimensions on the drawing somewhere outside we have to extend those lines and show it
so, delta p g we have related with the turbine ah your what you call ah turbine power output right delta p g; then ah that one also related to delta e governor output and then finally, delta f was the input and u write; so, all these things we have ah made it
so, these are my yee cells where do i record h z typically
we do not know whether it is the same input
and so, they suggest that you switch off the current and immediately measure the potential of the steel
the source voltage will remain fixed
you have an emmeter here and you apply some bias vds which is more than vgs minus vt and this is not difficult to arrange if you choose a sufficiently high value here it will remain in saturation
so, we talked about some kind of a condition creating a condition where proper oxygen to carbon dioxide balance is being maintained, then the dish where you are growing the cell should mimic the extracellular matrix of the cell in your condition that is the animal and we talked about the role of extracellular matrix how these cementing materials plays a critical role in determining the fate of the cell
so, thus in finding the initial conditions we first focus on those variables that cannot change abruptly that means we will concentrate on the voltage of the capacitor and inductor current flowing through the inductor
so, this you should not read for the second case right
during our interactions with acquaintances we send the signals of intimacy by enhancing this space or by shrinking it
we applied the second formula for the mixed variance and why i applied the second formula for the mixed variance
in this setup on the other hand we have both the victim and the spy running on the same processor core, the assumption over here is that this particular processor core is a symmetrically multi threaded processor core or in other words when using the intel’s nomenclature this processor core is a hyper threaded processor core
so, initially when the good quality potato was not available in india they were even importing it from the other countries to manufacture the best product
templates are specifications of a collection of a function or classes which are parameterized by types, this is the important part
things start becoming different when we have a pointer variable or a reference variable, which is of a certain type, certain class which is a part of a hierarchy
so, 300 kelvin is 27 degrees celsius
theta unit vector is perpendicular to r, so therefore it makes an angle and let me make it
in fact, as he walks away from this woman, he signifies with his body first that he is about to leave by shifting his weight continues to speak for a few more seconds and only then does he look away
similarly, we saw specific overloading for enum types and so on
we have looked at communication through eyes, the way our eyes communicate different levels of feelings and emotions, and how the cultural variations in their interpretation exist
that is the same way you are repeating, and this is a basically top down approach, starting from the overall problem
so, for going from this point to this point, we connect a series inductance as we did previously but then for going from zin this point to the 50 ohm point, we have to travel along a constant, along a g equal to one circle but then upwards
in other words, the only factors of n should be 1 and n, if n is a prime
so, that is a vector which is pointing in which way
in equation 3 actually you put this expression i 2 is equal to 5 upon 6 i 1 then you will get di 1 upon dt plus 2 by 3 i 1 is equal to 0, so this is equation 6 a
transformer is also very much a machine but it is a static machine
i call it v i
so, this is generally used whenever i am going to have extremely large rating when i have very very large rating and i want to kind of retain the flexibility to you know connected in either star or delta configuration
so when we observe that a project is relatively risky, then what we should do
so, when we insert this ammeter in this branch the impedance of this branch will change
and this is a circular hole
so, they are all related, they are not unrelated ok
so, given the values of i b 1, which is 18 microampere, i bib 2 is 22 microampere
so, it is represented with y t, so displacement will be in the horizontal direction
what i want to do is add material the similar kind of material like layer by layer in the other direction; that means, perpendicular to the computer normal to that computer monitor, i would like to fill many layers, so that a thick kind of link i would like to see
static means only one level of production which is stable, one level of production, 7 lakh worth of sales, 7,000 units only one level
the fact is different cultures interpret express experience emotions, expression of emotion similar to the research discussed earlier is different from country to country
when you click on one of these lxts, you will find detailed information on what that particular lxt entails so that you can make a decision if you would like to learn more on the same or not
but, the output is not going to be input v 1 multiplied by at minus r 2 by r 1 no it is not an amplifier, it is not going to are like an amplifier, that is because this point is unstable it will not stay here ok
so now on the circuit what this corresponds is 2 is i had my yl, i added a piece of transmission line whose length is theta and at this point i have my g in equal to 1
so so in the next step, you exchange this f and ah
r unit vector is nothing but sine theta, cos phi x plus sine theta, sine phi y plus cos theta z
so first let us go and draw the circuit components which is the diodes, the sources and the capacitors load
so, if the author writes a book very early in his life
the temperature, duration etc, most of all the sample size, and the sample size is very important
so, 200 into 13
so, lenz’s law, lenz law it is actually v1 = minus e1 right
so for example, if you look at the way balanis does it, he takes a few more steps because it is doing it in a not in the smartest coordinate system, but the other author for this is , the other book he does it in this nice way
so, it is 1000 rpm substitute all these value it is 120; f f is equal to 50 hertz and p is equal to 6 poles, so 1000 rpm do not make it p r right, then you will make a mistake here is number of poles right, so 1000 rpm
and we had already mentioned that there is no such thing as a perfect patentability search
the loss which you incur by selling asset is also other income
the top of the conduction band is usually denoted as e c plus chi, where chi is the electron affinity
so, the objective is to understand casting in c and c++
5 water binder ratio system or the blue system it is also somewhere in the same range
i mean if you take i mean if you take your what you call the the reciprocal of this 1 1 upon jx l , numerator and denominator you multiply by j
so, if the hierarchy is non polymorphic, then the typeid mechanism will simply not work
so, this e1 is going to be now passed onto the secondary side, which i may call that as e2, if i am not taking the turn’s ratio into account, but if i am taking the turn’s ratio into account, e1 and e2 dash are the same, there are one and the same because they are following the turn’s ratio
so, because switch is in position b and the circuit reached the steady state
so, it is this minority carrier diffusion that essentially causes current to flow in a p n junction
the unit being porous, the material being composite because of the unit's behavior, the motor behavior and the interface which we have seen has a significant role to play in the coaction between the unit and the motor
and i am connecting my substrate to the source
so, for ideal laser material we want to suppress the spontaneous emission and absorption at the same time promote stimulated emission
that has reduced in adults, that is pushing them to take corrective measures
so, let us see the function generator
so therefore let's first look at examining the same problem but under the assumption of a nonlinear stress strain relationship for the material in compression at the critical section
in the same family of learning activities we can also design activities using online collaborative discussion boards such as padlet or trello
so, when i am running the machine at rated speed with rated field current been applied i will get the voltage which is supposed to be the rated voltage of the machine right
and then you can add higher order terms, the next one will be parabolic and the next one will be cubic and so on
if i write it in terms of reactances, the reactance of the capacitor 1 over omega 0 c1 must be much less than r s plus rn and in terms of c1 it is like this
so, then only point a is the only one solution point c does not exist anymore because in this direction they will not intersect
and then the project manager carries out the executing processes which basically performing the necessary action to complete the work as outlined in the plan
if i do not want to do that, i want to stay in the time domain then how do i deal with
so, it will be your making it here, it will be v a this voltage is v b minus v b divided by your 4 because this 4 ohm resistance
this is 800, 8,000, 8,000, 16,400 and 26,400
alternatively if we go along this path where first we go down along a constant resistance circle, and then go up along a constant conductance circle
we have used this pin7 of arduino for connecting with the input of this relay through which we will be sending
they are not doing it on school infrastructure but they are using their own infrastructure to do this and it is probably on cloud space
the photo resist from this area, it got developed
so, in the mesh analysis we are more concerned about the mesh current and we were utilizing mesh current to solve the circuit
so, i thought that i will show that to you
since v by v by r is equal to i 0 because at resonance xl minus xc is equal to 0 and for which current is maximum if xl minus xc is 0
your deflections are going to be different based on the relative values of e top and e bottom
ok, they are typically
it was agriculture material
in this way, you proceed: at every step you add one more vertex to this graph and in the process you construct the tree
you take the half parameter, so length plus width
48
now, how do we get a system of equations from my operator equation
so proton or one h that is the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is a proton, nuclear magnetic resonance this is a unique technique which can analyze porosity using the water as a probe
7 and for 130 kl by r these values are given as 81 so fcd for 124
so, if i know the differentials i can do that, in other words what i am saying is:does e satisfy a differential equation that can be solved to find the field starting from a boundary where it is known
and when you write it in a coordinate free form, you get the same form like one over four pi epsilon naught r cube three p dot r r minus p
i have e r minus e i r right
so let's see the example
now, again it will be reflected, reflected from sending end side and again it is minus 1 coefficient
now, say impulse current flows through the coil of the instrument for a very short duration ok
now, let us say we prepare accounts or balance sheet at the end of 31st of march
53
so, the first day say i made this terminal very tight and the next day i was doing it differently and i did not make it so tight it has loose
this is the surface element, pointing out this way the inside, this volume
reserves and surplus has slightly gone down
whereas in this case, if the threshold voltage increases and if you carried out that earlier exercise i mentioned of trying to solve for the current here, you will see that the current will change
now let us wonder why he was able to do this
similarly, your either you can put a current source across 1 and 2 and solve the circuit
so, finally, we get 5 va plus 480 v naught
what does this do
it is an open source equivalent of matlab
now we shall see that because of this fault, when i apply some input, the gate output may remain the same as it is was in its previous state when the last input was applied
so, in this case we can we can deposit a metal which is of higher temperature here we are not worried right
this is the particulars
we had to we have to put a register
so, cannot be exactly 0
now, we will see pin and slot kind of example
so, the most popular of this is what is called pml: perfectly matched layers which we will cover
so, e is given to you, e incident is also given to you because you have designed the transmitting antenna right and you want to obtain permittivity everywhere ok
now, as the coil vibrates inside a magnetic medium, a voltage will be induced in the coil and you can measure that voltage
so, now if i connect a unity gain amplifier with a low pass filter which is my rc filter, it becomes my active filter
org, i will give you the exact url for it, and there we actually write the code and dump the code into this particular board
so what i am saying here is that not all paths can propagate signal events
and when there will be the shortage of the cash, at that time if you go out and try to arrange the cash, it may not be possible
so this also follows from the boolean difference concept
that is you design the structure for a certain requirement, certain strength, but inherent variability in the material can actually provide a higher strength
now in this case frequency is a spatial frequency right, the string can be like this, it can be like this or you know integer multiples like this right
now, we will start for your ac circuit
suppose in this case if current is say branch 2 say i d 2 plus minus j i q 2 and this i c is injecting
if you integrate, if you integrate you will get i l is equal to minus v m omega l cos omega t right
then the more of the get set functions you provide your actually exposing your internal data to the external world
and therefore the factors that affect other forms of memory they are also supposed to affect the organizational process of autobiographical memory
if you remember that the frame size must squarely divide the major cycle that we get from the schedule table consideration minimizing the size of the schedule table and therefore we can get 24 12 6 4 3 2 these are the frame sizes that are that you can consider for the other conditions
this d goes here
after that with using compass, we are going to locate the intersection points of this curve on this horizontal lines
so, from because only 128 bytes are there for the internal memory, first this 00 to 127, it will be internal memory and 128 onwards
if that is the case any inclination with respect to vertical plane we can perceive it only or observe it only in the horizontal plane
now in this diagram you see that your next step is your data path design where you come to the bus or the register levels, structures
so the weight of the h between v two, four and v three will be this: one plus five, six, because we have merged these two
so, when a solar cell is essentially driving an external resistor r, there is some current that is flowing through
well again just as we did insert we would do some re plumbing or re connection
and then with the speaker the alarm system when it will get activated depending on the percentage of gas present in the in a room; we use this d3 pin
and for our particular transistor, the current is zero up to a gate source voltage of one volt, and it increases like that
so, here they seems to be no problem
so here you can simply put the value of v and i
so, the tx pin must be connected with the rx pin, here it is pin number 10
traditionally, these two statements were considered as the final statements showing the results of any entity
so, the empty list is just an open bracket and a square close bracket
after all it seems natural that when we assign a value to the value of another name then what we are actually doing is saying copy that value and make a fresh copy of it
so, this is a very interesting algorithm and one of the most efficient algorithms to detect potential hardware backdoors present in ip cores and there have been various improvements over this algorithm since 2013, which could detect more advanced backdoors
this is pin number one, it is easy to understand
that current multiplied by whatever is the voltage that i am applying, that is the kind of power or instantaneous power i am inputting to the circuit
at that point slight difference in the way we have defining susceptibility for electrical case and magnetic case
so any sequential circuit, all, most all the sequential circuit today, are synchronise in nature
so, to come back we need to move in a clockwise direction once again but then we need to go downwards
so we assume that m is the number of bits that you are compressing or compacting and n is the l f s r length
so the different pipe line stages: you can reduce the power supply voltage also ok, to make it a little slower and, of course, to reduce the power consumption
so, let’s say this is my voltage which i am applying for the transformer
so, we will try to illustrate what happens if you deal with unrelated class by using class c
so, because of the your course of these interaction some amount of electric energy is converted to thermal energy and dissipated in the form of heat
losses will correspond to copper loss, which is actually i square r loss, nothing else
so, the entire apex cone 1 mapped to that point
wwe will be able to see that a frequency that is equal to cut off frequency, amplitude is about a by square root of 2, a by square root of 2
n type silicon is this blue colour blue colour
as we have just discussed, a statement is prepared for comparing revenue and cost that is called as p&l account
let us take 1 formula like p is equal to v i, so when you put value v and i you directly get the value of power dissipated that is 180 milliwatt
but in the opposite direction, this is going to be minus b right
see earlier when you laid out the network cables for those of you who have seen those thin and thick ethernet cables
so, when you see this, you solve it and you will find that f hl or f 1 is 500 hertz, fh or f 2 is 1
so, n is the square of the number of pixels right m n is the number of pixels
so, this is how this is taking place, so this value is 0, this value is 1; so, that will be getting a 1
there will be zoom in, zoom out buttons also will be there
now what about the purchases which we made in the month of august which we have to pay
for the gsm module, this is connected to gnd and the other 2 pins, the first one is tx that will be connected to pin number 10, and rx is connected to pin number 11
but within that culture we may find some smaller groups for example, ethnic groups or sub cultural groups who are disposed in a different manner and have retained a different association with time
ok, so all this things we shall be discussing later
there could be sale but it can be wrong also because please look there is a depreciation
this is just a one mask process, because we have used just one single bright field mask right
so, swimming is basically a species specific behavior and this species specific behavior has to be learned in certain way and not in the other ways
the led is glowing for 1 second and it is off for 2 second, you see it is glowing for 1 second and it is off for 2 second and this is repeating
in the present period in the current period we are keeping a closing stock of the 20,000 units
the head and chin down position signals a negative and judgmental attitude
the services are customized software
so, the critical points are formation of the base crack, increase in lateral force, formation of the mid height crack and with that the strength capacity is reached
the gain with which it amplifies is the common mode signal to produce the output
so, flux actually this is coming like this
so below we have a list of normally inventoried material what is going into the cement, electricity and so on
say, this is v i ok, say the adc can give you only this levels like 1 this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so on
so, we will just change the amplitude, change the amplitude of the signal, and we will see what is the change in the gain, alright
what equation i have now is dell square: v r is equal to minus q over k, one over epsilon zero k delta r
it also protects certain works in other conditions for instant example the work was first published in india, can be protected in india and if the author is a citizen of india the work can be protected in india as well
as we would see later on in our discussions of body language, the whole face contact which in corporates the smiles as well as nods depending on the content also incorporates a feeling of positivity among the audience particularly during the interaction sessions
so if i say totally 10,000 lines are there on the whole as flux lines, at least 2 or 3 can definitely be following the path through the air gap
so, in cases when you are using video lectures or videos in your content, so you are developing e learning content that is video based
if as a speaker in any event or as a participant you suddenly become aware that you are displaying this particular body posture, it would be advisable to change it to a relaxed palm in pump behind your back gesture and immediately you would feel that you have a better control of the situation
the clock should arrive almost at same time, but in power and ground the requirement is different
so, with this capacitor inductors topic is closed 1 and 2 example is given here
similarly for capacitor also we discussed that we will have the two equations one for voltage and another for current
so, v infinity we got 10, v 0 is equal to 100 and v infinity 10
the second is when you are executing code outside the enclave but try to access or execute code which is present inside the enclave so this should not be permitted
and, just to refer to them conveniently we have called them as f1 to f8
how much loan is left now
5 so once we find the dispersion length then we can find out the total length b1 and b1 if we find out we can find out the fwc the crippling uhh web crippling strength so if tis web crippling strength is more than uhh more than the load coming into uhh into the member at that point then it is find otherwise we have to uhh increase the section uhh or increase the web width so that web crippling can be avoided right so you today discuss what we have seen that uhh primarily the beam has has to design due to the moment and then we have to design due to shear and then criteria so moment uhh carrying capacity the design bending bending strength of the member can be found for two criteria one is for low shear another is for high shear so uhh in the codal permission it is given you for low shear how to calculate the design bending strength and for high shear how to calculate design bending strength then once design bending strength is calculated we will go for calculation of the uhh shear strength and the design shear strength if it is more than the design uhh if it is more than the shear force acting on the member then it is find otherwise again we have to redesign by increasing the section size right and also we have to check whether uhh it is uhh means it is safe under web crippling and web buckling so those criteria has to be also fulfilled of course we have not discussed about that deflection criteria which also need to be fulfilled that means we we will find out what is that maximum deflection coming on the member due to the load and support condition avoiding limiting deflection and if the criteria is satisfying then fine otherwise again we have redo so this is how we can design a beam which is supported laterally so laterally supported beam how to design has been discussed in next class we will go through one example of the laterally supported beam and we will see how to design that beam okay thank you
the mth pulse will survive what is the magnitude
here the average value is indicating the source current or the input current in
, right, aand when i design this, i see at the output voltage, a plot similar to this, which is the gain vsor is frequency
and angle between v b n and v b c, it is your 30 degree again and angle between v c a will be 30 degree
where do you think all the hard work will happen
1 mpa as cohesion available within a permissible stresses approach and fd by 6 is the mu sigma component which means the friction coefficient assumed here is about 1 6th or 0
if i am suppose to learn something, for instance pecking, for instance swimming; if i am suppose to learn this very behavior in one way and if you give me some other root to learnt it, it interferes with my learning
so we had misprepared a schedule and we learned about that the cash collection bill be ranging from 376,000s in the month of june to 6,000, 6,000, 7,000 in the month of july and then we talk about that 454,000 in the month of august
and each wind turbines supposed to be re represented and manufactured unless a drawing sheet is there for this wind turbine blades, post and dimensions tolerances clearly mentioned, and also materials used for production
so, why cannot we train people
so, negative sign means generation decrease and positive sign for frequency means positive sigh your, what you call
so, for an ideal transformer, these two should be infinity, because i will not have any ic, i will not have any im, i should not have any core losses, i should not have any requirement for the current for establishing the flux, right
so, long as a type conversion is possible it will do it, if it does not it returns an error
the spring is wounded into a spiral shape and many torque restoring kind of mechanisms
and this printing is little bit small, but understandable when you will when you see this one this is understandable right
that is more safe but to avoid the cost to minimize the cost to lower the cost be developed just in time
similarly, here i have tried to do a casting of the reference based on the unrelated class c which also should be invalid
the primary reason is that almost all the devices we use today they are portable in nature
so originally maybe i had you know a flux of 0
so, at the very beginning this pointer will be null, there is no printer
so there, sometimes the line such algorithm may find difficulty in finding a path because some of the paths may be blocked
so note that each allocation request is for 120 bytes and if you actually take the difference between any two consecutive pointers, for example a2 and a1, a5 and a4 or a4 and a3 you would see that the difference in these addresses is 128 bytes, the extra 8 bytes comes due to the presence of the metadata
so, when i am saying this i am talking of kids who are normal and often perceive as being difficult or being problematic, that small percentage of children who have illnesses will talk about it later
so, let us come back to the screen
flags, emblems and national symbols cannot be a subject matter of design right
for a more detailed study, i have written a book on financial accounting, a managerial perspective
phase one says the wave propagation phase
if you see this is the microcontroller, this is the gps module, which will be connected with the microcontroller that will sense the coordinates
where you will be will be using some set of defined steps that are to be followed in order to translate ah given design into the final fabricated chip that your targeting for now
now, what we see
so if you want a healthy growth of the company, company has to continuously make investments in new equipment, new software, new technology or at least in new investments
let us, take one example so that we can understand how we can find out the state and output equation with the help of state diagram, let us see this is the state diagram where we have removed the initial states as well as the 1 by s that is the integrator section
one of them starts from the left edge of the chip and the other starts from right edge of the chip and show some examples
this voltage v 1, this voltage is v 2
area is going to be two pi s prime, d s prime, z dot z because area is in the z direction
what is contribution
so, this features in terms of string is available in c++ therefore, it becomes really easy to deal with strings
but there are two flip flops, as you can see
so, we have already constructed ab and cc prime
and this concept of vd being forced to 0, this is known as the virtual short
in fact, in mqtt, the routing key itself, in a way, the topic right, and if someone had the subscribe to it
there is a way of showing that it is actually an exponential function but, we wonõt go into it
we have seen the criteria that op amp can be used in such a way that instead of amplifying, it will start oscillating
the error of that feed it to the other op amp within to make the pi controller and that output is fed to an internal pwm so there is facility for setting the frequency of your switching frequency for this buck portion of the converter with the help of timing resistor and capacitors
so, this will be 10 milliampere plus 990 milliampere is equal to 1000 milliampere or 1 ampere ok
this function this function that is figure 35, this function is equal to this function, this these 2 unit step function, this is these 2 your what you call step as summation of these 2 step function
that is, we want id to be equal to i 0
now let us first start by the, by showing you first script that i would like to show you
as far as star star is concerned it is a gain no step up, or step down, no phase shift
in this discussion we would look at proxemics, try to define it and understand the four basic zones of proxemics
so, what is my this is if this is my computational domain omega is the is the whole interior thing and gamma is the surface or the line in this case
in the next lecture we shall be continuing with the placement problem
it is a relatively what the a ns of description
for instance, we could have an algorithm which takes two numbers x and y, and computes x to the power y
the problem statement says the 230 volt, 870 rpm, 100 amperes, 230 volt, 870 rpm, 100 ampere separately excited dc motor okay
so, v minus v will be equal to v plus equals to minus ib plus right into r3 into r3 right from kirchhoff current law i1 is nothing but i1 is ib plus right i1 would be nothing, but ib plus into r3 by r1 then 2 would be nothing but minus ib plus into into r3 minus vo divided by r2 correct
two things: along the trail line, the grid points are traced and starting from this grid points, new trail lines which are perpendicular to the original trail line they are generated, let see
you can go to back to the previous slides and see that every other, all other terms cancel, which i am going to write to as e y, partial x minus partial e x, partial y, delta x, delta y
so, the better the design of the transformer, rc value will almost tend to infinity, it is not infinity, compared to the winding resistance it will be very very high, that is all i am trying to get at
a centre line, we would like to have a cane style kind of thing
he started manufacturing this product at his home and then started distributing it to the people living in his vicinity his neighbors and he found the results are very good
so, what happens under the influence of strong reverse electric field with the junction depletion region, electrons have enough kinetic energy
24 kilonewton minimum of tdb1 and tdb2 will be the tdb value now tde the design strength of the member tde will be minimum of tdg tdn and tdb so if we see those values are minimum of 426
here by india, i mean ancient india because the current model which is being practiced is mostly anglo us model
now, the question is why
as usual, you can evaluate them by connecting a voltage source and finding the resulting current or connecting a current source and finding the resultant voltage
now using these you can find out few values which are imported in our sinusoid as well as phaser calculation
so, cross section means which area
here you use ionizing radiation and finally, we have electro luminescence, which is what an led is
so, in this lecture, we have learned about concentric circle method and oblong method
now consider that in addition to n dash the port n dash we also have another port n double dash where the current is non zero
now, if you see this is second order equation solve you will say there will be 2 roots of this equation
where do the pml
5 they start going to the school
by introducing this i am also separating the role of time and space, i made it into two separate variables and i can that is convenient for me with maxwell’s equations because maxwell’s equations are nicely linear right
so, let us say i have noted down after doing all the jugglery what is v naught, what is i naught, and what is w naught
so if i am talking about 400 hertz or 600 hertz which is being generated in a particular system, i am definitely going to have more and more hysteresis loss
so, now, in these in these equations what is known if i ask you looking at these equations what all is known
now this is a natural occurring relationship
so, in that case your i infinity the steady state value right it will be 5 if you apply kvl here you look ah i am rather i am writing for you
then the last phase is she walks to work, now she is all done with her ride
so, if we are drawing this portion for the front view indicates this maximum diameter cylinder
so, similarly suppose suppose load demand has increased
so, there is a there is a gap in between the stator and rotor and that we call air gap right
so, an assignment can be by way of an employment contract or they can be a specific document of assignment
so, size of char times 10 this will get passed as the size t os parameter and this will be done by the compiler
so, in both cases what is common is that there is an induced current right
and so is the case with the mean square power
in the next tutorial we'll solve the next set of problems, that is, from problem number four to nine
this may prove difficult for learners to connect what is being explained about the choices to the question
so this way you can keep doing the iterations any number of time, change the power value, make it 1000 watts, and then read on the script
if you do so, it will become p is equal to 3 v p i p cos theta right
so, this is a right boundary i means there is nothing beyond this boundary and i am taking a simple 2d tm polarization case ok
there is a very well defined technique that we shall be presenting there, where the faults are all handled together and another thing also ensured: the process will be event driven
so, i multiply the second equation by what
so it means this quarter
now, of course, using o distance is r theta is good for o distance not very good for translate
next is a squirrel cage induction motor has a slip of 4 percent at full load
the third are a list of; these are the commonly used 38 operators in c++ which can be overloaded
suppose you have a simple four by four grid cell
so, what is the scattered field defined as
for dumping the code, we have already seen what all are the steps that need to be followed
so, it is not like that it will be on the top of the tower or building or this thing; lightning can happen, lightening stroke can happen even in the plane place also; so, this i have observed this one
so we are also in ideal situation where it would be one content that teacher has uploaded, all the students would go through that content whoever who wants to add, edit, do the modification, do that and come back
in the same way, we number the nodes also top to bottom, left to right
that means if there's an electric field as well as a magnetic field, then only this energy flows, otherwise it's not there
as the frequency increases, we will be moving along this constant resistance circle
if you are seeing, there is something like a slot
so, this is the one important purpose for preparing the cost sheet or the statement of the cost this way that we have to know the different components
it includes puts another single quote outside and it shows this internal single quote has been highlighted with the back slash
so, these are 16 different types of personality types that you can now come forward with
so you can see that total expenses more or less are same they are only decreased by minus 0
for example, in this case, we are going to prepare the budget for january, february, march
so that is one thing it means in a competitive economy in the competitive market in the competitive system you cannot pass on the pass on the extra cost to the customer it means if the firm has to bear the cost the firm's losses will start mounting
can you can you explain ways is equal to m
and now lets move on to see the same direct exchange, but this time round robin
and then you will be able to find out what is the real liquidity position of the firm
and this one your this is actually plus terminal, this is minus terminal right
now these three columns specify details about from where the segment was actually loaded from
(())(14:48) if it is not given, if it is given please do not assume friction and windage losses to be 0
2 to 4
it also signals certain uncertainty and we can almost hear a person saying oh, i am not sure whether i agree with it
at this particular point we are pushing the various arguments on the stack and this we have seen before
then visuals please select them carefully
so, we take the floor
so, can we do something so that i can use call by reference, but just make it an input parameter
so, such long term items are shown as long term provisions
so, in that case wr bar signal should be given and here instead of coming from external data input it will be from the a register the accumulator
in fact, there is a paper by i think dirac which says sort of mathematically shows that there should be a magnetic charge, but we have not found it ok
so, when the function is defined, there will be, or may not be a value for a and whatever value you have chosen for a, if there is one, that length will be taken as a default
for the top view; if we are looking from that direction this entirely looks like that
as far the analyst trying to figure out what vladimir putin’s next move is
a schmitt trigger has 2 voltage levels defined as the upper trigger point and lower trigger point
now only pick up e and ivala items, prepare a profit and loss account in the horizontal format, upper part is known as trading, lower part is known as p&l
and they also develop what we call discrete anode so the simplest one obviously, just the short cut of this ribbon
the right representation is having those thing and also having these continuous lines
we check if that number i is a prime, now this is a function we have already written
usually to suspend any shaft, for example, we would like to keep some shaft passing through that as a support or mast, something like a pole we would like tohold it
now, conceptually we can understand the resistance actually of a material if we think about moving electrons that make up electric current interacting with and being resisted by the atomic structure of the material through which they are moving
so, this is theory only not numericals, but you have to know all these things right
so, suppose so now range changing, suppose i want to measure up to 10 volt; up to 10 volt voltage ok
i had told you that the thickness of a single human hair is around 70 to 100 microns; 1 millimeter is 1000 microns
for the drawing sheet usually the technical content or the information will be provided as a table that’s what we call revision table
so, this everyone knows is a physical phenomena right
now, we have also seen 2 golden rules, isn't it
so, what do we expect
and for this reason when you want to look at fresh slices which is the most practical way of doing things, then this external standard approach is much better
so, which projection is good to represent a picture
see 3 1=2; so, which is approximately close to 1, close to 1
so what we see is that the input impedance is proportional to the inverse of the load impedance
so, which we just saw, so here dx1 by dt is equal to x2t you can write as x1 dot equal to x2t so when you compile all the equations which you just saw in this slide then you can represent them in matrix form as x dot t is equal to ax t plus bu t where xt is the state vector
so, keep these small tips in mind to be very helpful once you make the lab
if i do it from the same side and you will see again that the reading is back to point two, two, five
let us now take examples and solve some certain problems where we calculate the magnetic electro potential
so what is this application points
we are given 20,000s
so if i also plot the value of currents drawn from v dd, normally in a c mos currents, currents drawn in very low but during transitions, will find that they will be a small spike here, because momentarily both the pull up and pull downs are conducting, and higher the value of the frequency, more will be the spikes coming in right
are you getting all the items
now, if it is in the 3rd quadrant, what will happen
so, it means all payments, it means the balance is 32,000s but we have this for this 320,000s a negative payment we can use this 4,000 as a cash available
same concept like your the way it will be the i 1 2 is equal to minus i 2 1, v 1 2 is equal to minus your v 2 1 similar way you can write plus power absorbed is equal to minus power supplied because power balance or energy balance equals to now this has to be satisfied
now, question is superposition of y and delta networks is shown in figure this thing here; here it is shown
what happens, you have a fresh concrete, dries and due to restrain there is a tensile stresses developed
the compiler is providing that and the only difference is since no copy constructor is given by us, there is no explicit message saying that the copy is being constructed, but otherwise if you look at the output, it is exactly the same
so, that is as far as the cord beam design is concerned
this is generally a quartz tube and quartz can withstand very high temperature
64 ampere
so i am going to have essentially here also the conductors which are shown with dotted line,ok
so this i one in the result will go to t two
so, we look at electromagnetic equations they are actually linear, there is no square for electric field or something for the most 99 percent of the cases
so the third harmonic current cannot exist in a magnetizing current of the transformer which does not have its neutral grounded, if the neutral is not grounded especially in a star star configuration, i am not going to be able to find the third harmonic component in the magnetizing current
so, it is the limit that the observation point is very far away
so you may have to do an iteration here again
now what we have discussed, we have the notes which represent the concept
but if it is there, it is there
the outlet which you can control will have some resistance r
just by looking at the state transition diagram i can predict that, well, these are the places where i want to shut off my clock so that unnecessary state transitions are avoided
time’s up
so, when r is equal to 0 so, your i is equal to v by r, right
my output current characteristics changes
in the dynamic priority systems, the priorities of the tasks keep on changing with time depending on how close there to the deadline the priority keeps increasing
i assume you know this relationship for very small values of x, square root of 1 plus x is approximately 1 plus x by 2
and that is precisely is where we will be discussing about skeletal muscle that how they grow and how you have to be careful while we will be doing this kind of cultures
repeaters already i have said so, i am not elaborating on this anymore
so, v c t will be 100 e to the power minus 25 t volt for t greater than 0
so, for example this particular segment, which is present in hello has the, is readable, writable and executable while they segment cannot be written to, it is only read and write flags are set
so, in thisformer case, we are passing certain band of frequencies, in thislatter case we are attenuating some band of frequencies right
so, the namespace name followed by the symbol name, separated by the scope resolution operator is a way to refer to the namespace object
this g s matrix over here is actually underdetermined ok
so, that is r thevenin is equal to your 1 by 4 kilo ohm right and capacitor is 2 microfarad
so this will be the gate pulses which are varying continuously as you would see here and you could also see the inductor correct plot i of l along with v0
prof arnold’s son, i assume, john arnold jr
so, this will clearly show you that process of copy assignment for different objects in a class
namaskar, so in this week we will see how we can utilize the laplace transform into circuit analysis
let us take for example one particular library over here which is known as the advap123
then we have seen an example of determining the threshold voltage
hoarse voice is normally applied to pathological forms of rough voice
we might just want to make sure that all writes up to this point have been actually reflected on the disk
9 millimetre square
so, psychiatry and psychology are under tremendous pressure to be absorbed into sciences unfortunately, because the moment you do it you are getting into a reductionist approach
30 second and the re time constant 10 second all parameters are given
the basic definition for tolerances it is an allowance for a specific variation in the size and geometry of a part
so, if you see this particular figure, what we see is there is a certain band of frequencies that we want to allow and, certain band of frequencies that we do not want to allow
so this is on the left side you see a sketch or schematic of the act test setup where we used to have 20 volt application of 20 volt to drive the chlorides towards the steel from the reservoir this blue line indicates the reservoir
the phase shifts will be, phase shifts will be maintained exactly as it was being maintained originally in the waveform that is how it will be, if you actually try to decompose into fourier expansion the way you get actually these components will be whatever is the original phase shift that will be preserved with a factor of n
so, generally the name plate details will contain all these data at rated excitation at rated speed
if the origin in this case will lie outside the stability circle that means every point outside the stability circle is potentially unstable
today, we are going to start electronic instruments which will which can be either digital electronics base instrument or analog electronics based instruments
branch is a vertical wire segment that connects a trunk to a terminal and, as i said, via is a connection between two layers, between a branch wire, between a trunk wire
and similarly for ramp function r t is equal to minus infinity to t u t d t right
so, this is going to be the torque that we get, right
so, if i have this then what are the functionalities that we will need
no, how do you apply tangential conditions on h in a conductor; in a electric conductor
because of this it turns out that in a balanced tree, if we have n nodes then the height of the tree will be logarithmic because remember that the height doubles with each level and as a result of which we can fit n nodes in log n levels provided it is balanced and because it is of height log n, we will achieve both insert and delete max in order log n time
of course since we know that we are looking for the target square, if ever we marked the target square, we can stop
now typically what is expected is that whenever there is eenter instruction the only way to exit from the enclave is by this enclave instruction
let me just show it like this a circle and then i am going to show the rotor here
now, one of the things that ip policy should consider this social responsibility
the days of just knowing one subject and using that alone
so you can have a similar tied veneering but you have studs now which are then part of the member that transfers load between, basically holds the veneer onto the load bearing element
it is not possible
warm colors such as red, orange, yellow etcetera increase anxiety, appetite, arousal and therefore, fast food chains often choose color combinations of red and yellow because these colors increase appetite
then assumption four would be all the textbooks or subject textbooks basically are available as soft copies, so that they can be uploaded into the system
so at any point any of these two points if we calculate then we can find out the critical stresses of the section right
so, this was the born iterative method, now strictly speaking when i go to minimize this problem those of you who have done a little bit of optimization, you should know how will i minimize this
now both this, now this particular ratio, instead of finding for the whole company, it can be calculated for a particular division or particular range of products or sometimes on a single product
please understand that the resistance of the series field will also be 0
but these are given the scope for this course, but we learn in electrical machines or in machine design right
so, i can either i can impose a abc over here because i have to i have to specify something
once the diode is blown off the rectifier circuit will not see the second half cycle at all so it never even goes beyond the first half cycle so it is very important that we do limit the first current search of course i will discuss about the protection circuits and see how we limit the turn on current searches but keep this in mind that all is not rosy and all is not well and good with the circuit that we have just discussed, the turn on current surges can be pretty high and it could be a big drain even on the wall socket outlet
and once the labor rates are decided, normally the labor rates go up in the market, they never come down
today, i am going to be telling you a bit about the history of design thinking
we are in module number 3 and lecture number 27
come out with all possible ideas that you can think of to create a design
and, what does a function do
6 meters, which is 20% of the dimension l of the building
and, it is equal to the donor concentration; the difference is only within 10 percent
so, they represent something which you are going to receive from bank or something which you are going to receive from your customers or debtors
this sequence of steps has to be followed for any application development
some yeah; so, this is the object
so, under this condition if you make all r same right and r delta and r star all r same, then easily you can find out is conversion say r stand will be r delta by 3 right when you say and when you making for your what you call then one you can make it delta to star another you can make star to delta right
even small changes in design often leads to the large manufacturing cost savings
welcome dear participants to the fourth module of the second week
what static here means that you want to do this all in the compile type that is the compiler should be able to decide between these multiple forms and tell you exactly which of these different forms, polymorphic forms you are trying to use at your function call
the way how we have located b to connect 3 and 4, similar way one can even construct from d all the way to that end and all the way to this end to track 5 point 5 and 6 points
now because we know that the signal here is only water in crystalline hydrates, by deduction we can see that this signal here is actually now the interlayer water
so for every two terminal net the task is to find a path between the corresponding vertices like
it is basically that you have empathised, where you put yourself into the shoes of your customer and know their suffering to what is it that they are going through, really find out
so i write that thing
in surveillance and security, iot has got very good applications
it can also be calculated at a operating profit level wherein it is operating profit upon sales
so, vs, which is the voltage across the capacitor in that polarity, vs increases
and therefore, v 0 can easily be obtained using nodal analysis; that means, suppose, this ah v 0 i mean this v you have to i mean ah here
let us calculate their derivatives
so, m i to m j is called cost i j, and we use this same recursive inductive definition choose the best
only thing is that these lines cannot over lap, they must be kept going from left to right without over lap
so, there are essentially 2 aspects that make this design interesting for use as a puf
keep in mind, dick cheney was a very important politician
so, it should be easy enough to open it, even people with such a condition should be able to open it but still kids should not figure this out and open it and get into trouble
for example, if the preparation of food is linked with a particular gender the space is also occupied by that gender only
we can see the change; i am increasing the voltage, right
then the next step would be the teacher starts instruction or teaching and
ok, now the another thing is that i said that you accept the words moves with the probability that decreases with time
however, kavita is another student of mister joe, who says that this sort of background music is actually distracting her from learning better
have the steel reinforcement in position already and then concreting is done to complete the confining element
though nvcs can be studied individually in terms of separate encoding and decoding processes; for example, we can look at eye contact or a particular gesture and can try to decode it
it is a favourite gesture of queen elizabeth when she is on royal visits and public appearances, and usually we find that her hands are positioned in her lap
now let's also say that the gain magnitude we require is 20 and because the gain of this circuit is negative the gain will be minus 20 and it will be equal to minus gm rl and from this we can compute the desired value of gm
where there is so many blocks, moving a block around is not so easy, because moving a block to make space here might make the the space on the other side less that can create a problem, right
this asks us to select two particular elements
so, that this horizontal thing whatever we have projected that we are uncovering in that direction
so, this is that your flux surrounding current right
that also we have made it 8 plus 4 is equal to 12
so you can see all the three years consistently the company is paying dividend of 216
and there are some aluminum oxide micro tubes, very thin tubes inside it, and there is a heater coil in the middle
02, which means 20 milliseconds
you might have guessed why we are taking recoats to a lossy media because we have already given the interpretation that pml with coordinate stretching is like a lossy an isotropic media right
so, the stability criteria that we will look at is something very simple
so, iphnew is 2 x iph at 500
this i, this is i and this is i square, this is i square plot right
and if you remember in method two, we looked at the whole panel with no openings
as you see here 1 by f noise
to understand how dielectrics behave, we'll first talk about a polarization
but actually in a practical case the terminal propagation process is very complex because the net can be pretty complicated: large number of blocks, large number of inter connection lines, so there will be large number of dummy terminals
so now combine stress i have to find out now if i see i have calculated at this point the shear stress sigma s shear stress sigma s and bending stress sigma b so i have to find out the combine stress right
in case of 1st quadrant system, the front view after folding it from top view comes at bottom and if we are looking from left hand side, the view comes on to the projection onto this opaque plane of left hand side uh to the right side
what is specified in gdb because gdb tells you the run time status of the particular program is this additional point over here which tells you the current location where the program counter is present
so, that it is easy p type silicon what we are looking at
i agree that the iron core volume is high here, no doubt but because of the fact that the permeability is really really small for the air gap as compared to a normal ferro magnetic core most of the times we tend to ignore which is not correct if we want correct calculations
now we talk about the material mix variance
so, this is all fine, this is how maxwell and company had written it in terms of real valued physical quantities ok
there is also a raw material inventory
so, we can overturn that idea which was quite popular in the literature and here we see some images where we see the growth of c s h during the main hydration peak, we can see very nicely how these c s h needles grow over time and that is all very good, the problem is that you know, any cement will look just the same so you have done it what is need to do it again
so physical synthesis, as i have said, is nothing but collection of timing optimization techniques
so, we want to place the queens now row by row
what the fanci guarantees is that the algorithm has no false negatives that is if a trojan is present in this particular ip then definitely a fanci would actually detect it
so, , once you do this , now, i n is equal to minus of i a plus i b plus i c
so, anyway let us let us go to the next topic and that is based on this size
but now let me take a metallic, any shape, ah, ah, any shape of a metal and i give it some potential that this entire surface becomes an equipotential, because metals they cannot be any difference between two parts
so, perhaps it goes all the way in that way and is something like such kind of object we might be going to see two leg kind of portion with cut
the static data member gets constructed before the main function starts; this is something which probably you have not seen before in earlier cases
so the transmission parameters will help you to stabilise the relationship in those cases when you have cascaded networks
first of all, we have to construct a semicircle passing through a with radius ac and centre as c
now, as the example i have shown, to detect and bridging, i have to put one of the lines involved in the bridging as zero, while the other lines as one
we will answer that much later when we have studied some bit more of c++ mechanisms, particularly you have studied about inheritance
you see the first inverter is driving a capacitance
field went to 0 like you wanted at the boundary, but is it desirable or undesirable
so, let us look at that problem so, b point is 40 mm below and 50 mm in front of vertical plane
so, if i have a int star i p then it is pointing to an integer type of value
that particular amount is kept under this item number two
is what you are saying let me just check if i made a mistake in yeah you are right the yeah
here after this has been done if i write it with operator notation of plus then, what it means is the compiler finds out that for the operator plus is there any operator function which takes on the left and right two string type variables, because fname is of string type lname is of string type
if you take the flip side and you look at the free memory you think of the free memory as a fluid then the free memory is shrinking
if it is satisfied, then p i is considered to be the eigenvector of matrix a
if i want this current to be leading maybe, i should put a capacitor but the capacitor cannot put inside the slots
what i have here is what is known as a broker
so, let us look at what we have already done, this was the equation that we had alright
did you write in classrooms when you were learning
if i ensure this then no matter what x and y are plug into this equation
usually this computer computer graphics involves effective use of graphics as a tool for visualization of design ideas
so first method: easily you can get the voltage, angle, ah, although angle variation is very less
so, power factor is this 1
this term ampho essentially means both means you have the same element
so we are going to use the some of the material from ideo, some materials from other references that are listed as well
first, what this delta p does is change, is the volume
no these are well this is a testing function so
what is normal abnormal; what would the normal person do in phase of conflict, what they would i think the gandhi; gandhi was normal i think then he was the most common man his tendency was very simple what has happened it is a fate a comply it has done
there is a symbol of diode here also
2 into 91
now in this particular case 15 and 13 are relatively close, so they fall within the same free list
is it means that we are playing a videogame and in the videogame the circuit that we are designing has some filters in it
both of them are rotating at synchronous speed, if i look at phi a or phi f both of them are rotating at synchronous speed
now for the diode, the diode if you see when the diodes are off they would see a maximum voltage, the peak inverse voltage peak inverse voltage would be vrms root 2 so if it is 230 it will be 230 into root 2 325 volts to that you give the extra the tolerance swing for that particular place
and second situation applying or passing rated current, whereas applying only a fraction of the rated voltage
now, we already know that b is a, and we already know that up cast is possible
now, all i need to do is, to multiply whatever is the emf per turn by the number of turns per parallel path
there it is tone and pitch
behavioral genetics understands accepts and explains that the traits they pass from parents to children; and this is how it transmitted from one generation to the other
now, rotate in such a way that this axis makes an inclination angle with the plane, horizontal plane and one of the edges will be resting on this plane
so what people do
so, it will give me over s as f dot the outward vector outward normal to this which is n or n one
j is of the joint material and fbt is the tensile strength of the unit
now i am going to have the armature conductors rotated by the prime mover
we have seen know a 12 is equal to minus p r 1 upon p r 2 right ; that means, if we assume let assume area capacity ratio p r 1 p r 2 is equal to 1 there there is p r 1 is equal to p r two that is their same; that means, a 12 is equal to minus 1
similarly, if go for a material with the higher band gap so if eg is higher then ni will be lower, so iso will be lower and that will also increase voc
oh that
just quickly we have the importance of the project life cycle also because we are talking about the budgets and plans and the controlling of the process
so, the same antenna problem over here as human being over here right; so, this guy is sending out let us say and incident field let us redraw it over here ok
so what we want to know is: given the same size the particle, same amplitude of these electrons oscillating, suppose one particle is giving out red light, which is roughly seven hundred nanometers wavelength, and another particle is giving out green light, which is roughly five hundred nanometers wavelength
now both are actually same r 1 2 star and r 1 2 delta both are equal just we said that setting r 1 2 star is equal to r 1 2 delta because you have to find out equivalent hence they will be equal
only for certain companies car is an inventory
85 millimetre right
we are in module number 4, orthographic projections ii
so, r x is 10 r v is 1,000 then this will come out to be how much
as we will look at different real time operating system, the first thing we will mention is that what is the type of the scheduler
you can see the blades can rotate along the wind direction, the whole the setup and also the motor motor may run as the wind will strike the blades
so, merely by adding up the three bilinear curves of each peer, in this case we have arrived at the lateral force capacity of this wall itself
so, you know that is three phase one
as a input impedance of the amplifier is infinite, there is no current flowing towards the input terminals
so, i may also write a few more words
now what actually i have input to the entire system is the electrical energy input what i have given as electrical energy input is the input to the entire system
he simply took the first stick second one, he just fixed one in the other and then sultan drag the banana using the stick
once i understand the response of the system to e to the power j omega t i basically understand everything right
we looked at lap winding; wave winding and we said why one would have the number of parallel paths as many as the number of poles
first problem was very simple where we were given the composite information without dividing it into different category of the workers
one more was like
so, these were some of the examples of different gadgets that we have created
now the word vitrification comes from vitro which is glass which means because of the presence of silica's and the presence of metallic oxides there's a fusion process of the silica compounds and it's like formation of glass and that's really what gives strength to clay to the clay bricks
so, shear sliding is the second criterion
let us try to explain this
the first one begins with construction of curves from which the 3d surfaces then swept or meshed throughout
so, use a bit of common sense
now, next is that your by two terminal circuit we mean that the original circuit has only two point that can be connected to other circuits right
this transformation is shown later the way you do the transformer almost similar it will be there r 2 dash is equal to a square r 2, s x 2 dash will be s into a square x 2 and current here this side is i 2 i 2 dash right
so, if you apply kcl at node 2 what you get
one over four pi, epsilon zero
one is the carbon footprint where we started off with the amount of co2 emitted while we are making a unit weight or concrete or product of concrete or a building of concrete, why
so what i get as k phi is volts per radian per second right, so volt second per radian tell me the value whatever it is
noise in fundamental parameter to be considered in an electronic design it typically limits the overall performance of the system
now, it i can have a square or i can have a rectangular any number of shapes i can have right
eyebrows are high and curved, on our forehead wrinkles may be formed and a wide open mouth is also formed by a dropped jaw
so note that since we are assuming that there is no cryptography present, there is no encryption or decryption or any other stored keys present in the edge device therefore, the challenge and the response would be sent in clear text
so, as the name indicates in this particular case rotor will be blocked or it will not be allowed to rotate
so here since you know the output of this amplifier can be thought of as the combination of the correctly amplified input signal + some error
so, and, if you look into that this current, this current, we are taking actually this way this way if you take the loop it is i 2 and this way, we are taking this is your this direction is i 1 and 5 ampere shown it is upwards right
so, this address is the location of mylib int, so we can check this by also printing the address of mylib int, where you see that it is identical
it basically involves running program
so, this is the motor in operation and this is the armature
an active bias circuit is circuit which produces a particular bias voltage irrespective of any changes in the circuit or temperature or other voltage variation, so this this is you know an active biasing network
so you can count number of loops which you have created and try to find out whether number of loops are satisfying this particular theorem or not
this is also 77,567
so, the rotational loss in an induction motor is substantially constant right
so in this module the first thing what is linearity, what do you mean by linearity
so, common mistake to avoid is an example i set the total time equal to let us say 2 t w right its everything is coded up your time step is correct space step is correct everything is correct, but you forgot to run the simulation for long enough
so, readelf with the minus l option and then the executable and you get an output like this way
and this equation is true, whether you have an intrinsic semiconductor or an extrinsic semiconductor, n and p refers to the concentration of electrons in holes, which is the first factor that we saw earlier
similarly, i c is equal to , i a angle 120 degree, it will become 297
now when the fork system call returns, it could return with different values
so this has been taken from the cost models for future software lifecycle processes, kokomo 2, published in the annals of software engineering 1995
sometimes, people feel that the digital age has killed these aids to the immediate transference of meaning
long term loans and advances, nca
this is something we can naturally compute using a for loop
so that means there must be a delta function somewhere
so, now, v o so, let us use this equation v o is vn times this
so, if this is my come
r s can be made equal to 0
the second one is more general and many processor chips actually use this kind of a strategy
i am research scholar in the mechanical department in iit, khargpur
but just i want to impress on you that resistor is not just a simple resistance as we have known from the circuit theory
so the blue one correspond to the ground line and the red one correspond to the vdd line
so, whatever the credit sales are going to be there, they are fully collectible, so hardly there is any bad debt
what is the charge density near the shell
so, any real world simulation has all of these errors in it there is no such thing as a perfect simulation; perfect simulation happens when delta x delta y delta z delta t is all so tiny right
they manufacture more than what they are going to sell in a particular period
it starts rotating
the other thing for example, we hear about a lot is cell phone radiation damage to let us say biological tissue, is it true is it not true well, it is not fully clear
now, if i consider the object well before i come to object let us look at vacuum
and then we looked at various approaches to timing optimizations
i have this low pass active filter; i have high pass active filter
one end of the bulb is directly connected to no output pin of this relay
so you always keep this equation in mind
so, normally there is no current, so, the coil will not move normally, but if the coil starts to rotate due to any reason, if the coils say if the coil is moving, then what happens
so, instead of going line by line through the list readlines we can take the entire list contents and just output it directly through writelines, this is an alternative way where i have replaced
and of course, it is limited just by imagination, there is a huge set of applications
they will say that obeyed and you do not know what is outside and nothing came back
and n that speed is given is rpm revolution per minute
5% or the 18% per year
human facial expressions as well as their recognition by computers has become a widely studied topic since the concept of effective computing was first introduced by picard
so, for example, a 12 volt supply with 100 milli volt of ripple at 120 hertz
so, ru plus 150 plus 400 plus rupees 1250 if you add up all total charge will be rupees 1812 right
so, my equation for the depletion region is c v g s minus c
this term i already know is joule heating, which is heat produced per unit time, or power consumed in the resistance
so, today we saw 3 basic elements of our electrical circuit, that are resistor, inductor, and capacitor
let me show you this example and then we will come back to the discussion on chunking
so, it is very easy to know the selling price
so, uh, continuing further the process of learning about the basics of management accounting
how we will get
so this is becoming 125 kilo newton
85, 49
another example of this i am going to take relates to diffusion
sw, that charging and discharging cycle will be repeating so many times over a time interval, t
again that will depend upon the amount of anhydrite or gypsum
so, in the exercise that you have been doing, you have not accounted for, we have neglected the effect of accidental eccentricity, but within a design framework you cannot do that and the code requires that accidental eccentricity be considered
so, as a rule of thumb, most of the systems we design, we have to limit clock skew to within ten percent
in other words, if you are going to transfer this from one file to another, you do not want to worry reinserting the backslash n because this is already there
if you have any if you have any other thing if you have that is that is your what we call that is your philosophy right, so v p angle minus 240 degree, suppose it is multiplied by 1
tthe signals between f l and f h we cannot pass
but you can use some of the language features to handle errors in a more structured way and instead, there are several libraries which is the part of the standard library which give you additional feature to be able to handle those errors
one neighbour of this cell will also be a one neighbour of this cell will be one, this will be one
i will show rl like this but it is exactly the same as what you have here
so, question is that that resistor actually will see here it is mark plus minus there 4 ohm here it is minus plus , and then ohms' law and kb kvl your what you call will apply , right
these two points because of light we cannot really see into two points, but only one point as that we will see
so you see, since a is coming out straight, so here the delay will be five
so, epsilon can be complex and mu also can be complex right
i is known after i solve the integral equations very good what is za now
and so ignoring the voltage drop in primary reactance is not quite justified right
so we use a thermometer, an industrial thermometer, contact based
and, the average value so, for input 0 because it is positive for half of the times, negative for half of the times
so, we want to find the following at 2 temperatures; one is 77 kelvin and the other is 300 kelvin
but if they are switching in the opposite direction, so one of them is going from zero to one and the other is going from one to zero, then the difference in voltages can be twice two
now that we have said that this e1, which is corresponding to the flux, established that flux is the one which causes the core losses and the flux, is established because of the magnetising current, which have flown even under no load condition
because the air gap is uniform
it is a cylindrical object
let us see the source of inefficiency of the edf scheduler
this is level or flat compounded but this is also differential
so, what we will do first
so, once we clicks it up
once the multiple cracking has happened then all the tensile stress is taken by the textile
so, 9 chunks will primarily mean that 9 into 3 if you are making a chunk of 3
if, it is a plane this entire plane revolves around this axis, then we will get a conical frustum of solid object; that means, material will be filled inside also
he devised a system of reward and punishment to ensure compliance of rules and regulation
even the simple hello world program that we have written a few lectures back which essentially just prints hello world by invoking the printf statement
now, once we know this, we let us now perform the experiment, and will continue thiwith san experiment in the next module
therefore, if the turns ratio is a, then the reflected impedance between these two points, you can compute we did it assuming a ideal transformers
wherever you move this drafter, it always shows only horizontal and vertical directions
so, if you write v a is equal to ah your ah v 0 minus i 1 is i a plus i b plus i c into z 1, z 1 means r 1 plus j x 1 this branch one right this is your ah first voltage drop i a plus i b plus i c r 1 plus j x 1 right
so from the netlist that you get from the front end design, we can do some circuit partitioning, then we can do possibly floor planning and placement, routing and then the final layout
now suppose just for discussion if the cost of this item would have been 40,000, what we would have done
so, plus literally puts s followed by t, it does not introduce punctuation, any separation, any space and this is as you would like it
so, we see that i 1 is equal to i 0 plus i 2 prime
that could be chosen
so, ideally we would like to have so, zero is never possible
59 kilo hertz and above that it will not allow; that means, you can see the change in the peak voltage
they are also going to be shares in future
the circuit is that the input signal, the input signal is given to inverting terminal right; that means, it is an inverting amplifier
apart from that, they have got voting right for doing several things like appointing auditors, like taking major business decisions for merger submergamation or for making fresh issue, for coming out with right issue or for for taking a very large quantum of loan
one profit is which we calculate in the cost sheet
and, here somewhere we have to mark first of all a’; a’ is always be 10 so, at 10 distance a’ we have ok
first, we have talked about the containers, arrays, structures and unions; the three main types of containers that c provide; and we have talked of managing the different variables and addresses through pointers
we have already knew this intuitively, but forward problem looking at this equation is what
let me give an example which can give you the idea
so, in this case scale is non uniform
let us look at the program logic first, then we shall be showing you the code
here the problem is i have two classes, i have a vector class which keeps a linear vector of a size n, and have a matrix class which keeps a square matrix, not necessarily square matrix it is a keeps a matrix of m by n dimension
and this will have many sub drawing sheets having thrusters separately, having gyroscope separately, compartmental space separately, even nuts and bolts separately supplied to these industries
so now we are left with the 90% of that 4 lakhs to be collected
if you have a reverse version of subtract then that flexible operand can be subtracted from or the normal data
now we have assumed that conductor is coated with your what you call ice and uniform thickness
now you can see that the weight is slightly towards the individual who is on the b side and then the question basically asks is that who would experience the heaviness of this load more compare to the other one similarly
then, we want that what will be i 0 plus current division, then it will be for current division path it is multiplied by 6 divided by 6 plus 60 right
the complete picture emerges before us only when we combine the two
so if you do not do it, then the following logic block, like a same kind of scenario: driving clock, receiving clock
but it is not investment, it's not finance also
so, what i get actually as wsc will be isc square multiplied by r1 plus r2 dash, right
hhow peak detector works, then we can make the circuit, which we have made on the breadboard and finally, you are able to look at the finally, you are able to look at the simulation right using the mmulti saime
this is again something that we know
next this current source, it is independent current source; so, turned it off, but means it will be open circuit right
this is more of a recap for you, this is a c program which is trying to reverse the string as you can see the stack is defined as a structure, which has an array which is the container of the elements and a marker which is a top index which will keep the current index of the top most element, and these are the implementation of the four functions empty, top, bush and pop; empty just checks if the top value is minus 1, minus 1 designates that there is no element because are the minimum index value in the array could be 0
so, rho mn is rm minus rn the distance between the centers of the squares or circles that is rho mn right ok
it causes priority inversion and unbounded priority inversion two very bad problems
boundaries not just boundaries the location of the triangles, the nodes of those triangles right that is of interest to me because based on that like we did in the previous slide i can calculate the matrix
that means that our initial direction of current was clockwise but finally the direction of current is anti clockwise
so, and that's the same all over the surface because it's a conducting surface times: sigma two, d s, sigma two
and anything which is not in this case, so if i have a nonzero value as a number or if i have a nonempty string a string with seven characters or a nonempty list a list with three values then all of these would be interpreted as true if i just stick them into a condition
so, 0 to 1 that is t 0 is equal to 0 and t 1 is equal to 1 right and then this one then t 1 to t t 1 is equal to 1 then 1 to 2 second and t is equal to 2 what is the idt this is the idt
so, next we will come to the lightning surges; so, the voltage produce on the overhead lines by lightning may be due to indirect stroke or direct stroke
so, now, here it is also because everything divided by s
if you look into the motor, it is rotating at a slower speed
now achieving data obfuscation for the computational case is far more difficult
so, we don't have dc signals
after we carry out static timing analysis we find out that there are lot of timing requirements which are not been met
so you can see that at h by d of 25, the stress reduction factor with no eccentricity of the load is one
so, we can have some band which is around this value, right
it's simply because your superimposed loads are not always designed to sit concentrically with the wall
our objective is to adjust the load parameter, that is rl and xl
nothing will happen
97 we use it in the previous expression m dash divided by 215
so, now, if it comes here then it will see the output should be this much v o should be here ok
7 you know that the new solution is simply proportional to the new value of vs
if that is the case how these views really look like on vertical plane and horizontal plane
also there is this i think this is great app if i can use it efficiently plus i won’t be able to carry this bag
so, water flow rate is constant and say this is equal to m gram per second
so, i am going to have somewhat more difficulty in terms of changing over the current from plus to minus or minus to plus which we would look with the magnifying glass in greater detail about commutation that will be the next discussion after looking at different type of generators
we take max of the solution from i and the solution from j plus 1
analog means what
involves the a i’s; obviously, m of them involves a i ok, but our number of variables in this problem has become how much now
plus 0
this right hand side over here is going to be the way i am going to impose the boundary condition
therefore i cannot really define potential between two points
he was the professor and consultant to companies as well
depletion type mos transistor then we will continue the next class right now what we have seen we have seen that if you are given a n channel mosfet and enhancement type mosfet, how the mosfet will operate how can we understand the different cases, when we apply different drain to source voltage, what about the drain transfer characteristics for the enhancement type mosfet
so, if you look at this particular figure, this is one port network where the current goes in to the linear network and comes out from the other terminal and voltage is applied across these two terminals
so, particularly for transformer impulse test if you do so, you may not get that ideal value, but this is the standard you have to see around that only
so, second this what you want to achieve why test bed for studying myelinating disorders sclerosis where myelination is destroyed
so, this this r id square will remain in the circuit any circuit
so, since b2 is responsible for changing the displacement from x1 to x2, so, we connect b2 between x1 and x2
so, the rotation of the unit then becomes the basis for formulating the stress strain relationships at the unit level
we we will see how we can design another kind of oscillator, that is your crystal oscillator,; that is your crystal oscillator which is very stable oscillator crystal oscillator
so, the input impedance that you have calculated for a single antenna in free space you were very happy about it, you put it into an electromagnetic environment where there are various objects and suddenly you find that your you know your performance is not so good right
so, make sure that that does not happen
so, it is very, very alkaline but it is consistently alkaline because it such readily buffers the solution and you have a constant high ph in your environment
this is the top view, complete circle visible
so the transistor, like here is represented on the schematic like this: the solid, this is the top view diffusion on the lower layer and top of which the polysilicon layer in red which is the gate
because some for time i am going to see that b is under the influence of south pole after sometime the same conductor will rotate, will be rotated by 180 degrees because of which it will occupied the position of a
so, what is saying is that the displacement field can depend on electric field in different directions
now, again, i have said that in a typical vlsi design flow you cannot do the thing in one go
this is just for your reference, you will certainly, if you know this
and if you actually look at this point where i am having 0 current but certain value of flux density left over from the previous alignment that is remaining, that flux is remaining
now, if you run that same program again obviously you would get a different pid and if you look at the maps for that new process you would see that it is a change in the address map and this change is occurring due to aslr
interim dividend
there is not a single mistake in it
in the first expression for the failure governing the failure governed by the toe crushing we had the expression in terms of the ultimate moment but knowing the height of the wall you can estimate what is the lateral force corresponding to the ultimate moment
now i should also tell you one important thing
but l upon r is tau
so, this 4 ampere current actually directly you will go through this your short circuit your path, because in this case it will be ineffective it will be ineffective and in this at the same case your i, if it is ineffective means this i x dash will be 0 and i dash will be 0
so you can see here there are two transistors in parallel coming in the pull up, then one transistors series here and in the pull down
so we are placing an image charge q one at a distance d on the opposite side
let us take the case of silicon; i have 2 dopants; one is boron, one is phosphorous
so, trusted execution environments are becoming quite common in the recent years and finding various applications in multiple domains ranging from embedded system to high performing computing
till now whatever digital tablets have been in the market where we write the medium that they use is specifically not meant for writing and the problem that we have is with notes carrying papers
so, divide this 1 by root 2, this is 2 pi f n phi max, divided by root 2
so, you can see a lot of sticky notes with all our observation from the customers
activities should be interspersed to within and between videos with constructive feedback for learners
so, how the management accounting came into v ink
this is the most common method that is used for synthesis of filters now a days
and the idea that the recursion must terminate is exactly analogous to the claim that we said earlier that when you write a while you must make sure that you make progress towards making the while condition false, so that the while exits
but right now we shall not use it, but however i will share this thing, this folder also with you
so, a solid wall with no openings within it should be expected to have a cantilever deformation profile implying that the top of the wall is free to rotate, the bottom is fixed and we have in our previous lecture been able to estimate the stiffness of such a pier and related to models of elasticity of the masonry, the geometry of the wall, h, length of the wall, l and t the thickness of the wall
so let us mark that off and during that only we will see current here, a current eye flowing
if we were doing strength design, we should have said f
some people actually call these crows feet
so, we want when v is equal to 10 volt, fsd current should flow through the meter ok
once you do that, then you know what is the typology of masonry you are examining
so, it make sense to also have z current directed along the z direction
and this is something that sometimes is also witnessed in interrogation what is called as suggestive interrogation, okay
so, it is very important to keep track of what is the static type that is what the compiler c and what is a dynamic type which happens at the run time with the compiler cannot see
so, now note that we select the inductor current this is important will should keep it in your mind
this is the role of the successive approximation register
let us just select this plane and this plane and will select a maximum value and a minimum value
so, this is my ok now x is my set of unknowns which is the tangential component along the triangle we have seen that the u i’s right
now, let us come to the errors ok
now the way usually these designs happen is that you are given a value of gamma n from which you find out the value of theta m and from which you can find put the fractional band width
now, what happens is when the item is identifiable, it becomes very simple, we know how much is a cost for it
now, top what we are going to see is there is something like this part, we will see and this part, we will be in a position to see; that means, this one
now, region i and region ii will the waves be travelling at the same angle
in the preceding modules, i have discussed various aspects of nonverbal communication with you
now m itself is equal to chi m h in, which is going to be chi m b over mu zero minus chi m over three m, and this gives m three plus chi m over three equals chi m b over mu zero, giving m same as here on the top
then we will use one hyper terminal, which we will set with the same baud rate with the port through which the microcontroller is connected with the pc
it can act as a shunt resonator because it can for certain frequencies give high impedance
so, that we will be in a position to really see the drilled hole size and other interior details
the output can come here, let say so
so, this is possible that is this kind of a constructor for derived class can be written provided the base class has a default constructor, which does not need a parameter
so you saw that when the blue colored diodes are conducting this is positive with respect to this terminal
and you know that aspect ratio of a wall has a role to play in whether it is going to be dominated by flexual mechanisms or whether it's going to be dominated by shear mechanisms
so, how much is left to be collected
it is given to us that sales are on credit and the credit period, all sales are on credit payable within 30 days
in general, if i have a thing there, i will say if i choose this entry as my k point then i must add this entry to get it up, and take this sum or i have to take this entry and add this entry and then add this and so on
5 mpa and fs as stated earlier as 230 mpa
so, this means that we are trying to link to the library that we have created, this minus capital l is the search path for this particular library
so this is how it is completely the winding is made
so, what we have constructed is, from p mark some radius, once radius is there from that point mark an arc
the unrehearsed ones are forgotten
so, if any company increases the price of their product and if the competitors do not follow the suit, in that case what is going to happen that the company's sales are expected to decline
so, midpoint p is it is 44
so, if i ask you what is the physical meaning of k
so, suppose if there is a nonzero vector say p i that satisfy the following matrix equation
so if i am going to actually reverse let us sayonly the armature current then the torque that i generate will be in the reverse direction
and then the beauty of the whole thing is, you really do not need to know a lot of c++ to be able to use them, because their use their design and the way they are organised are quite intuitive and you can just study from the manual and start using them
does it really work
now, you apply kvl to get your i your what you call i 1 and i 2 i 1 i 2 same
so now lets clear again and now open up topic exchange
so if we look into the different type of advantages, one is the better quality control
so i will not have, when i is zero, the flux will not be zero
so now you have 2 positions vertical, right
a zero, b, zero a one b one a two b two are six lines which are laid parallel to each other, side by side
so now she will type in: ah, the message which says: python send default dot p, y
so, the first thing very importantly and most people included it in their assessment is the carbon footprint or the co2 equivalent emissions when we are talking about a unit of a material or a product
right, assuming here the b is in the negative phi direction
and is there a deadline for this
you can see the formation of the plastic hinge here in the reinforced concrete column itself, you can see the shear failure that is caused because of the interaction with the infill at the corner
now, with 0 volt across the capacitor, they act like a short circuit
so, these m and j these are sources ok
now having discussed about depreciation, let us have a look at how it appears in the annual report
so, whatever function i am trying to find out phi, let me try to express it in the basis of b n ok
if point b is 25 mm below horizontal plane 20 mm behind vp, the solution will be b and b’ will be on the opposite sides
in addition to that, phi 1 to another path right, it will all it will phi 1 to also link phi coil 1 as well as your coil 2, this is actually mutual flux
some societies encourage the idea that young boys or little manners they are called do not cry or look afraid
they do not want it for, for exploitation in quarries
it is a modulo 2 counter because it counts 0 and 1
now if i draw the small signal incremental picture of this, we will have the input source vi, rs, and it's connected through capacitor c1 to the gate of the most transistor
now, we apply input signal here
so, i can write fib 2 in the table directly without even going to it from 5, i am not coming down from 5, we are just directly filling up the table, just keeping track of which values depend on which values
so the direction of this d a, it's upwards, as you can see here
8 kilo hour right
integral means the area under this curve, so this total area under the curve
so, there are several questions that you will need to answer before you can get started with the design and actually code, for example, how do you represent these concepts of engineers and managers, they will have to be represented somehow
now, you have the given current source and you have another 3 ohm resistance and then you have terminal a, b and this is the short circuit current
bank overdraft
so, let us see how the operational amplifier can be used as a differential amplifier
to cover this much angle the distance in terms of oa minus op 5 it will cover, and this ratio always remains same for a particular spiral what we have drawn
one of my favourite problems because i love to solve this problem
0098
if you go to workshop and if you want to remove this much material from a metal, which is shown here then we can we have to machine that part
less understanding of the topic, which related to what you had here, the last note is class understanding of the subject to the topic it’s related to that
so dynamics power, by its definition, means whenever some signals in the circuits are changing, those changes cause some dissipation of power
and as far as our capacity of c1 is concerned, c1 should be much greater than 1 by omega 0 times rs plus rn
so, what is the peak value of the input if you i, if you want to know, you can use the circuit which is your peak detector alright;
so, anil is here to help us, and he will be he will be showing us how the circuit you can be implemented on the breadboard
that will be perhaps ah much higher order and that would perhaps mean it's a really ah very good intelligent system
so, this is what will be we put the we put it like this right i and e; i is equal to 1 to 2 and e is equal to 1 2 and 3
so, they have got different voltage levels for logic high the voltage level is minus 12 volt to minus 15 volt minus 12 to minus 15 volt and for logic 0 it is a plus 12 to plus 15 volt
so, mature state rather right
this portable devices all run on battery power
now you can see that these both these functions they tend to infinity in slightly different ways right, they tend to infinity in slightly different ways
so with all these we developed several cdf cumulative distribution functions for different cases and then generated many graphs like this and then picked up various points from these graphs and then developed a nomogram where if you want let us say i accept a probability of corrosion initiation of 0
since 64 is less than the size of the buffer defined in test code so there is no problem and there is no overflow that occurs, and test code completes successfully
so, you can control how many frequencies are in this in your current source by playing around with tw right
so, therefore, all c standard library names are actually for all practical purposes get reserved in a way that is you cannot write a printf function of you own and also continue to use the printf function given in the c standard library because the moment you write a printf function of your own, that also as a name in the global space
so, let us first assume that there is a plane like this which is horizontal
so you understand that what is the actually cost
you all know it
another example in this kwl is the question what have i already learnt and here the stem is i learnt that something happened or i learnt how to do something, all these questions and the corresponding stems help learners reflect on what they have learnt and before this activity was given
so, this position is three fourth from the right or you can say one fourth one fourth from the left ok
from top if we are looking at it in the first quadrant on the opaque plane we will have projection
people have always been associated with studies of time in different ways, but before we started using the term chronemics or even before we apply these understandings in the area of business and professional communication, a number of scholars have to be listed to acknowledge their contribution for the development of this idea
so, this s into f though rotor your frequency f2 is equal to s into f when rotor is moving with a slip s and s is equal to your ns minus n upon s right
the other kind of surfaces are coons surfaces
so, the inside details we can show even this dimension as this one also as long as minimum 10 mm length we can maintain it
now for such applications the code gets constructed on the stack before it gets executed
just to illustrate another point that we have seen this is a simultaneous assignment which says okay, initially we have seen 0 prime, so count is 0
some changes are going on in this flip flop by the second flip flop and here this out will not change to so roughly
so this is discharging, c load dv out, d t, and in the other part you are charging
so, whatever is a relevant item, normally it is either operating or investing
so, one locate it there, from 2nd point locate a curve here and 3rd point locate it and 4th point locate it, 5th point make an arc, now 6th one this
so we have lots of values of gamma s or gamma l to our design with
that is, you connect the current source to the source terminal and depending on the current difference the source terminal goes up or down and that action the source voltage going up or down will change the vgs and consequently change the current
our body language as well as our appearance reveal a lot
4 e v, and the wave length will lie in the u v region
so, ferrite is a ceramic material having magnetic properties similar to silicon steel, but having high resistivity
so, we have the circuit given in the figure
on these interdigitated electrodes i want to have my sensing material
supposing i had taken global edge number 1 how many variables, what all variables would have appeared
obviously on the screen you can see that very easy example is purchase of land
now a few more things
so, what we will do first, first we will short circuit the independent voltage source, leave the dependent source as it is in the circuit and then we connect the voltage or current source to solve the circuit to find the value of rth
when it is when we apply a mechanical pressure there is a change in voltage,
but trying to figure it out yourself is part of the fun and yes it is also part of a job as a design thinker
so, it will be 40 meter h will be 40 meter
now, let us talk about very important point which is the input offset voltage umm input offset voltage
so, take the printout of the given sheet that is p&l, balance sheet and cash flow which is for two years
now, if you see this particular segment of the circuit this segment of circuit is nothing but voltage source in series with 1 current voltage source in series with 1 resistance you can apply source transformation so what will happen
this is the rms voltage a simple thing just for this thing i have written the phi is equal to flux is phi is equal to phi max sin omega t then, how the voltage will be induced and we know v is equal to, n d phi by d t in coil you have n number of tones and phi is the flux linkage
and obviously in this study no admixture was used initially
again similarly, this is the beginning this is the end and this is going to be the beginning and this is going to be the end, right
so, this is actually done a lot in the case of the photonic crystals community
then one can question it its not the event rather; the consequences the result that
so, if the largest k such that k divides m and k also divides m
it is used for fast development of embedded applications
so, we looked at the butler volmer equation which describes the anodic, cathodic reactions in, in the system and we could see that we could actually find a relationship between the applied current that we have and the depolarization potential
so, so whenever in the second integral represent the energy returned or delivered by the capacitor in the interval 1 second to infinity
the reason of designing that particular sensor was to give you an idea of how we can fabricate a mosfet, right
let us actually take a step back at this point and think about the learner centric approach that we have discussed in the previous week and that we are using throughout this course
here we have an interesting analysis of the palm and hand movements of certain celebrities which would further help us to understand this analysis
so, what is that curve does not exist what we have these discrete data points, from there we are trying to construct it
that is the effect of displacement current
next one using source transformation technique, determine the current through load resistance r l is equal to 4 ohm in this figure 16 right
it contains many components like solar panels, thrusters and many other things
so, this is platinum, these are all filled state, these are all empty state
for making the concrete we consider two types of concrete, 30 mega pascal strength concrete or an m30 concrete having the characteristic 28 days cube strength of 30 mega pascal this would be a typical mix design for each of them this is coming out of our lab work, cement, water, coarse aggregates and fine aggregates components for each for 1 meter cube of m30 concrete
so, these defence strategies could be present either at the compiler or at the hardware or by building special enclaves known as trusted computing environments
here you can count how many faults are possible in terms of this fault model
proprioception the activities of the endocrine and other autonomic activities and the spontaneous activities of the neuromuscular systems, so he said that memory which can either be obtained it will be demanded or it would be a spontaneous plays an important role in our interaction
there is very less contamination and less heating to the wafer
i'll explain to you in a moment but before that we have to give the dot polarities and let me place this dot here and i shall place one more dot here
meaning, they are very happy
researchers have also suggested that our facial expressions often match with the tonality of our voice
then mark few points 1, 2, 3 on vb prime
why these numbers are important
boundary has a
so imagine its strength, your intensity and it last about hardly 100 microsecond; very fast phenomena, but about 40 micro second later; a second leader called dart leader, means stroke usually following the same path taken by the first leader
and here i am looking at from the company perspective, the other side of the parties
and as usual we are always providing self as the default first argument
and ql is the total quality factor that is including the internal and external resistances
now, often you just want to create a sample window, you just what to window which has a default background color, default text color, you want it at a default center location in the monitor you wanted it to have a default width and height and so on
now what happens on the receiver side is that the receiver also runs a similar loop as shown over here but the receiver would also time that particular loop
then you would have the type of the section and as we see over here, there are various types of the section from starting from programming bits which essentially contains the program or the code that was written, you could have symbol table, you have no bits the allocation table and null and so on
but otherwise that shnt capacitor also improves the your voltage level, so it also reduces the losses
4, i should have had here 1, coming down to 1 is very easy, no saturation effect but going up to 1
04 percent of what i would have incurred in r1 as the loss under full load conditions
now of course all the networks that we have showed so far are based on lumped element networks
so starting will be possible
the bottom line is the resistance that appears across c3 equals 1 over gm plus r1
now, if we look into the up casting we can we are just enhancing the class with data members and if we look into that if we put a value 2 to the a object, that is the data part of a object value 3 and 5
but steady state error will remain same right because r and k p values are same for both the cases it will remain generation for your ah reheat type will take little bit ah little bit more time to settle it is uncontrolled mode
this is want is known as a basic concept of access specification or feasible or it is also called feasibility restriction
so i have to layout a net like this: the s one has to be connected to all s one, s two to s n
you may be charged by bank charges by the bank as an expense, you may receive interest
but it is, many do not realize it and they look at it as a competitor and tend not to use cathodic protection
and this is the final two input terminals where we apply the voltage ok
so, this is my star impedance z your what you call your impedance of the star connected load, so that is z theta, it is z angle theta, it is balanced one
where all multiple inputs starting from r1 to rp and outputs are from 1 to q
so, a would be nothing, but 1 by beta greater than this particular value or inverse of this right
so, i can say that
so, let us say this is my object right some incident field is falling on it, and something is getting scattered field this is scattered this is total
at the end of this for iteration or loop what we end up with is the largest common factor that we found between 1 and the minimum of m and n which is indeed the gcd of m and n
so, you can calculate easily at instead of calculating directly i am writing s 1 into sin of cos inverse theta 1 right
this is the task of the designer
now, vswr was a very important concept in the olden days when we could not directly measure the reflection coefficient
and n now he is changing the frequency
so, based on this let me try to work out 1 problem on this or the induction motor you know performance characteristics
that's something of a simplification in this particular case, but in the other direction the center of stiffness and the center of mass along the x axis are not coincident and therefore that eccentricity is what is going to cause the torsion in the system when earthquake action in the y direction is considered
reverse the direction, so there is up to the surface; so click up to the surface, control button, then click this surface
s is called as apparent power because it is defined as a product of rms voltage and current
so we will be repeatedly using in these form getting our power or phasor diagram equivalence circuit, all of them in transformers, ac machines and so on
because the topology shows us the property of the network which is unaffected when we stretch, twist or distort the size and shape of the network
if you are interested in reading papers then you will find that people use the thin film technology to fabricate transistors
how do i deal how do i how will my update equations change them
so each of the loads will be having some capacitance value
it does not indicate the absolute size of the return
so in this primary converters it is always required that the inductor is placed in series with the pole
typically, designs specifications may mean that i want to run this circuit at a minimum clock frequency of certain things may be
so voltage magnitude matching is very very simple, not a big deal at all
we did it
now, next is voltage induced your what you call in this coil due to the current here i 2 will be minus j 2 look at the arrow here it is upward, i have made it your what you call minus j 2 into i 2 right here, it is minus then minus j 2 into i 2, then plus 10, 90 degree angle, 90 degree minus 10 angle 0 degree
2 kva, 220, again let’s take the same parameter what we had taken, at 220 by 110 volts transformer, right
i am not saying you will be able to go on purchase in the market 1 hp machine for rs
it is not like i am multiplying hardware four times same hardware, but i am partitioning it into four parts which are approximately equal
n cap is just the normal vector for this surface that defines the boundary ok, because whenever i define a interface i how do i define the interface
so, if i access the functions as object they will always be static
so, between the two adjacent slots if i try to see what is the angle, if i may call this as some alpha, each of these are going to be delayed from each other by an angle alpha
so, to understand the technique, to understand that process flow i have to understand initially a simple example which was discussed in our last class
that means this equation, this equation, if you, i am, i am just making it
for example, if there are threads and broken out sections which we will learn in the next class, during that broken out sections we can really show that dashed kind of lines
now, information about the patent title of the invention, which technical field the invention belongs to brief description, the novel feature the, inventive feature and part c, public disclosure and part prior art, whether the invention knows some prior art and and you will find that, whether there are scientific publications or patent databases whether they there are granted patents on it
ok, now let us see what is the linear feedback shift register
so, this you can easily solve and find out the value
now, if d cannot access this, then there is no fun of having this data member inherited in this part of this class
now, let us try to find out the procedure of deriving the state and output equations from the state diagram
the area which is not exposed this red one on the mask that area in the photoresist will be stronger, since it is a positive photoresist
22 into 10 to the power 6 millimetre to the power 4 this is slightly higher than the earlier one 90
so you account for the presence of the grout when you're making this estimate
we were given the raw transactions
so, that is the nomothetic approach where you already know that this in this age boys of this very culture belonging to this very days largely they construct such types of stories
so this can blow the transistor queue and that is undesirable and that should be taken care of that should be addressed
so, the new short circuit current, so iscnew, so i am going to write it isc'isc is nothing but iso', iph which is equal to 2
m is the number of measurements
once we have that infrastructure ready, you can manufacture the systems as many you want; you can manufacture 10, 20, 100, 1000 as many you want
the maximum number can be m plus n minus one, not more than that
if it is a favorable variance meaning thereby that standard cost was more, actual cost has come down so it means the variance has become favorable by 286
so, now, you know it is not so much difficult to understand; what is within it
initially i am allowing lot of volatility
so here, ah, each vertex represents a channel intersection
now, let us try to understand, what are the various circuit elements in the electrical circuit you will see
these bins are also circular and doubly linked list and satisfy coalescing okay and it has first in first out
so, as vn is part of the response which decays to almost 0 after 5 time constants it is generally termed as transient response or the natural response
so, compared to 300 kelvin n c and n v are higher, this is because we have more density of states available at higher temperature, simply because they are directly proportional to t to the 3 over 2
we want to transfer 3,000 rupees for that and then finally is to transfer to general reserve and remaining amount will be transferred to the general reserve that amount is say for example in this case is 5,000 rupees
iin non inverting amplifier it will be 1 plus rrff by r in, right
and we will sell set one ratio between these two
and therefore, as far as design is concerned, it's not going to be possible, it's not going to be feasible for you to prepare a pm interaction curve for every reinforced wall in the masonry structure
ok, so you must be looking at ah, unique identity, not i p v four anymore, but indeed i p v six
so, your right to stop or is what we call an infringement
you see if ldr is interrupted, the light is glowing
now both these things are going to definitely induce emf in the stator winding itself
let us say i want to track it every 5 minutes
so, it is always be 0 to whatever that maximum size this solid works permits
as i said, it is very similar to class; like class, the namespaces can be nested
so, theses are states that available for the electrons to occupy
here no again and again i am not writing those previous equation number, but all these things are been given right
so, let us see what should be do about this, so del dot d; when you see del dot d what is it remind you of in which theorem of vector calculus comes to your mind, divergence of a vector field; gauss’s theorem or divergence theorem right
the third which we have not yet actually discussed but i would just put a pointer that, when we tried to overload operators their certain operators which are very difficult to overload with proper syntax and semantics if we did not have friend function kind of functionality available in c++
so, how you can still make your estimation more accurate, how you can do accurate size estimation
functions and pointers can be mixed in a very interesting way
so, like i said this is nothing new
so, just may have created an example here to show you what kind of difficulties you accept
one is if you say this is your circulator and you connect a negative resistance to say port 3, port 2
less than this right i have to sample at least the nyquist rate in order to correctly rep correctly represent this thing over here and at the same time we have our courant factor right
the idea here is that we allow only a fixed set of priority
in the same way if i want a dictionary i have to give it a completely new name like this
again, you see, here the method is similar, but the sequence of cut lines are a little different, as i will show with an example
so, it is average heating effect is proportional to this right this and therefore, i square we write like this, i 1 square plus i 2 square plus i n square upon n and therefore, your i is equal to square root of i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square by n right
we can repeat it to construct the symmetric points on the other side after that join them to construct this parabola
the feedback has to be in the correct sense and the transistor has to be in saturation for it to behave like a good amplifier
so, one has to be careful even at saving the drawings at regular things
it means that what we are doing, we are starting from output and using the circuit we are trying to find out what would be the corresponding input for the output given to the circuit
so, consider now the impedance of the rotor circuit for z 2 is equal to r 2 plus jx2 when it is a standstill right when slip is equal to 1
so, at those locations draw two lines parallel to this one, let us call this point as something e
so, this is a current source
giving height of one side distance between flat ends and their taper slope using a flat taper symbol, we usually go for tapered features
i hope you are able to complete it till that time
what you told that is that k b, which is m cross n, is zero
so, f1 the transfer function will be vs upon xs and f2s as the transfer function of second block will be ys upon vs
but, if my gcode is rec and i want to call this, drawrec should get called and so on
there is hidden line there and also there is a hidden line
integral dl will just simply give me 2 pi
so, it means the next part we will start doing it is that is the financing arrangements from where the funds will come, 318,000 shortfall from where it will come
we will see that this particular circuit has 1 node the voltage across this particular circuit a, b would be nothing but the voltage across both of the resistances also because all those elements are in parallel
so, now, let us use all of them together and find the solution v p minus v n v o ok
we have to get data because in india we do not have a lot of data available we have to go to the plants cement plants mainly aggregate plants, concrete plants and see what is that which is going into unit of the material and what is coming out
25 per kg how much it works out this will work out as 795 kg out out at rupees 4
so, this part
then we have to put this together and come up with an impact assessment
mechanism of producing more and more genetic variation
we build a heap in order n time, call delete max n times and extract the elements in descending order
now we come to mutation, mutation basically is a process of change in the genomic sequence and such changes basically it could range from a single dna base to a segment of a chromosome
now, notice that the capacitors are still in place
it is a minimum cash balance we have to keep always in the form of cash
so, we can change the gain and that is why the symbolic representation of the signal at the input and the output we can see that the output is magnified version or amplified version of the input, correct
one will be at omega 1 z 1 will be r plus j xl minus xc that will be r minus jr that will be z 1 will be root 2 r angle minus 45 degree because on root over r square plus r square and angle will be tan inverse minus 1 because it will be tan inverse your minus r by r
now through this window, what we can do
this is given right 1 hertz is given, 50 ohm is given, we should know what is boltzmann constant ok
,so, if i want to measure the r 2 r 2, it would be 10 kilo ohm, correct
2 degree ampere
it is symmetrical because this side and this side is same look
i have already shown you the usb connector through which you have to connect to either a desktop or a laptop, then you have to open the id that is there and then you need to write the program
yeah, that is true; that is true
if it is the way we have taken and all versions i have showed you how to take it right
so, what we are actually doing
now the moment the switch goes off
so, it will be 3 upon omega s into i start square into your r 2 dash right
now, let's analyze this
so, the answer is yes
this is called a complex triangle
so, monthly and quarterly budgeting can very easily be implemented in the firm
is it possible to modify it, so that you can also use it for some other application
and when i apply a current, what is the kind of fluxes produced, how exactly it passes through the machine, in what part it travels and so on and so forth we would like to analyze
those could be given in use in types of icons or could be words written there, but the user knows that this is different than the rest of the title bar because this is place where i can look for options
so, what is dc and what is ac
188, 1880 and what is the actual
so, for that let me give you an example, all right so, if we focus on screen
how to design a filter that will provide us a particular desired frequency response
cost sheet is a part of cost accounting minded
this got table is fixed in the program space, but the variables move into any region in the program space
so it is more generally, you can possibly shift this one and then shift this one, so your grid will look like this, right
p is 740 and t is 27
the solution for te and tm waves is given in for cylindrical waveguide is given in the book by pozart
you should also find out the synonyms for keywords, because if there are words which can have which can be alternatively used, then you would also search the synonyms, and then do a search of the alternative words as well
we have to see
so i have tried to just in summary tell it it has significantly affected the way the audits are done, the way the corporate governance is done not only in us but also in other countries
there are further complications with these equations these constitutive equations and i will point them out when we come across ok
it is not a closed one, 360 degrees, oh something has happened wrong
with this with with this i think this induction machine is i i have to we have to close this right
so nature, nurture controversy that you always read about, that you always hear about that is what we are going to discuss today
now mechanical part developed is equal to p m is equal to useful torque plus losses into rotor speed, so useful torque is 160 and this loss is given 10
we found that the tube is made up of quartz
now you can understand, you can provide realistic estimate of the wire delays, provided you already had made some placement
now, there you may not care that the permittivity is 3 or 3
this is popularly known as just in time in some factories have this implemented, so there is no need for a warehouse
the national evolution largely pertained to the limits of copyright; copyright like patent was enforced only within the boundaries of a particular country
but how do we build such a thing
these are some application of tension member where, in case of cable stayed bridge, we need to design tension, the stay cables and similarly, in case of truss members, few members become tension
so, it means there is a reduction by the production by 1,000 units
you need a d/a converter of n bits, after n clock pulses this eoc signal will be made high
so, this amount that we are willing to invest today for which we are expecting that some benefit will occur might be after n years or a number of years or so
right, we shall come back to this
so, what is the condition
first i will make something like a rectangular block
it yeah you; so, i can write this in terms of r dash dr dash d theta and then gets converted to rho d rho d theta
so from these i can find out m is equal to m dash into one plus submission yi by summation yi square into 2h by 21, right
so, for that we are using 75 millimeters ok, then press escape
so, there are different kind of movement with these cells is undergoing
patent patents are kept for 20 years designs for 15 years trademarks have to be kept renewed at regular intervals
so, it will just opposite it behavior will be just opposite to the capacitor right and this is the characteristic impedance
in case of the unskilled what is this 4 workers and we are paying at the rate of how much
so, by changing the magnitude or the amplification of this voltage, we can change the height or amplitude of this wave we can make it larger or smaller by having an amplifier before applying this voltage at this point
now, in general corona mv is equal to 0
this rules are framed
then there is a normal sub instruction this is r1 – r2, result is going into r0
the other form of special curve is called involute
so, first of all there are capital n pulses that i have used the definition of this pulse is that it is 1 inside the nth segment and 0 everywhere else right
in terms of subordinate’s perceptions of their likeability apparent sincerity, interpersonal influence and perceptions of supervisor support
now, i would like to adjust this center line distance or perhaps length, then smart dimensions i can use it
so, in this case, that is why it is given i is equal to minus v by 10, it is minus 10 ampere and the capacitor at capacitor voltage i mean if you look into the circuit when switch is open at t is equal to 0, the capacitor volt that means, as soon as it is open, it this voltage source should not be there because it is disconnected and that is at t is equal to 0 it is open
now, if we have actually put the last queen, if i was n minus 1 then this is the last queen right
5 hours then the total output will be 810 units
there is an infinite loop in the spy process and for each cache set the spy process creates certain load instructions, which accesses all the ways of that particular cache set, while this is done the spy also times these load instructions
we can also define it as error divided by the measured value depending on the situation into 100 percent
now, in general the noise is also created by the several components, you see here chopper, noise of a car, siren right, guitar, radio, ambulance, racing car, and what not and what not right
1 is serial output data; so, this we have already discussed
so the impedance of these three circuit elements which we discussed will become zs for the resistance will be only r, for inductive it will be zs is equals to sl, for capacitor the zs it would be 1 upon sc
we looked at how the processor actually managed the memory, how it actually allocated memory regions for enclaves, how things were actually stored in the enclave and so on
so there is feedback in this simple circuit as well
similarly limit tolerances for which limits are mentioned it can vary from 1
for each neighbor nx ny if it is not marked, then i will mark it and i will insert it into the queue, right
i can see v in i can see v out i can see v out by v in, i can see theoretical gain, i can change the amplitude, and i can see the change in signal
but if clock is zero, lets say, then both this inputs of the nand gate are zero and zero
so, it is coming 2076 watt right
so, why are these design principles and strategies important
so, if we are using an inverting amplifier, feedback should introduce 180 degree phase shift; if we are using a non non inverting amplifier, feedback should not introduce any phase shift right
that can be a multiple levels of synthesis, as you will see little later
so, need not remember the values like what is called low resistance
now there are various ways of understanding of what porosity is and how to actually study the permeability of the systems in concrete, but one of the common methods of understanding porosity and the distribution of the pores size is mercury intrusion porosimetry
now this is just mathematical relationship, but it also works this way
how do these functions j 0 and y 0 what do they look like
i make it off, and then i make “val” equals to 1
1percent but look at the same amount of carbon nano tube, the increase in mortar is even higher, this is cannot, you cannot prove, cannot model this with composite material approach, same thing more or less with concrete and i will show you why this is but so we thought that this is quite interesting
then if n divides m if the remainder of m divided by n is 0 we return n and we are done, otherwise we return the gcd of n and the remainder, so this is the remainder
now, the teaching function started off as a way to spread knowledge and in fact the reason why people enroll in universities is to gain knowledge
these are clients, client, this is a client, client one, and is goes on like this
and if you are looking back side part, it looks like; perhaps if it is made with a plastic a very thin material, this is the part where we have this plastic material and the remaining place is empty
from here i cancel this mu zero and this comes out to be a by two mu zero, k, k dot
so, what is 4
so, this is a battery with emf e and r i is the internal resistance of this battery
now what is additional is a these two points which have highlighted in blue line is for a member function invoking object is passed implicitly which i have just explained and that turns out to be the left operand, so only the right operand is explicitly mentioned
so if you remember i will reiterate the problem right here
if i may call this as ia, this as if, ia will go up as we increase if of the alternator or synchronous machine
first let's look at the sprint burn down chart
and inventions can also be a result of serendipity
now thatif we have seen hartley oscillator; then, let us we also see colpittt’s oscillator; why
so, the incremental current i is nothing but the derivative of the characteristic at the operating point times the incremental voltage v
now this seems like a very good solution for solving crp problem in puf, there are still a lot of research before actually taking this homomorphic encryption to practice
the concept of chunk that we talked about 7 plus minus 2 will be 5 and 7 plus 2 will be 9
in the open spaces therefore, it becomes necessary for us to create areas for acoustic isolation and also for the space which should be known as the individual territory
i mean it is much, much less than an sem, it is much, much less than x ray diffraction so you know, it is not that expensive
the problem is due to the fact that the contacts these contacts have some resistances they are small they are small and generally we do not bothered about them, but when these resistance which you are measuring itself is small then anything small compared to this resistance is significantly large this is small this is also small
i let the rest of the show being handled by my team here
in india, they were not allowed to enter in the indian market
so, if it is a volume integration, it is a three dimension derived delta function, it is 2d case, so, it is two dimension derived delta function
now, this there was a current source here because we have to get r thevenin we have to get r thevenin
let us look at another case where a line is inclined to vertical plane and it is parallel to horizontal plane
and for this condition to be satisfied, you know that both r1 and r2 have to be much more than rs
non punctuality is not necessarily related with a negative work culture rather it has to be understood as a certain empathy if people tend to get late
similarly, v 2 we can write z 21a plus z 21b into i 1 and plus z 22a plus z 22b into i 2
now, if i am talking about below rated speed and ia restoring to its original value, torque capability remains the same, that means the speed will change from 0 to rated value, when voltage changes from 0 to vrated
now, what it is doing
if we do this then as soon as the stack is instantiated here they call is made to this point top is initialized the c out happens which you see here control comes back and then the reversal of the string happens
so, we are assuming that the medium is static
now, estimated input, how much is the estimated input
and then after that there was a generation of ideas and all of a sudden thing were happening
particularly you see that because of rise in the current liabilities, the current ratio is falling
for example, suppose if you write p is equal to say 30 watt and q is equal to your 20 var right, it is ok
2 degree, so with we can close our today’s session in which we discussed mostly about the y y connected balanced system, so in next session we will discuss about star delta or you can say y delta connected system thank you
now, controlling owners have their own interest
now, you have these two equations where only unknowns are i 2 and i 3
and here lies the problem
we need to estimate the combinational delay t comb delay right, because setup and skew are already known, i am assuming
i will also just write the reverse, when na is much greater than nd then you have wp much smaller than wn and the depletion is almost entirely on the n side
why he is inducing the customer to shift his preference from the samsung to the other company because that other company has given something extra to that retailer or that distributor and that is why he won't to
2 is coming for lambda is equal to 150 and 53
so, this pulse function is non zero only over one segment right
so when you look at dimension, the simplest can be possibly one dimensional compaction, where we try to compact the layouts in only one dimension
similarly, i can also directly still refer to this, by saying it is name 2 colon colon v 2 1; this also is permitted; explicit use of name is permitted
so the complete magnetic field lines or the flux what i can get for p number of poles if there are p poles i am going to have phi times p as the total flux in the inside area or inside curved surface area of the stator
so, 1, if you see further d i d by d v g s right to i d s s; i d s s is constant; d by d v g s of 1 minus v g s by v p whole square
so, it shows how efficiently you are utilizing your fixed assets to generate sales
beside this, you have the size of this particular segment in the file and also the size of the segment when it is loaded into memory and additionally you have flags for this particular segment, which specifies whether that segment can be read, written to or can be executed
so normal problem will be this: ah, grid routing says that how to complete this routing, over coming this obstacles, so there are so many alternative paths
so, so an alternative way of analyzing star delta circuit is to transform the delta connected load to an equivalent star connected load, using that delta transformation
but for high priority tasks like emergency events, we should be able to execute in the rate monotonic framework and should be able to high priority, occur high priority to those tasks so that these meet their deadline
i is equal to 35 ampere is given
so, can you anticipate what will happen
so, to start with continuing with the same example, now this is again coded in c++
so, this is the way to use the dynamic caste operator
and finally let us consider the case when we have a capacitor in shunt with the load
so, please be careful whenever you set up the thing think, think calm quite think over it how you really want the facility, because your facility looks nice you can bring people and finally, the end user they will be happy you know this is a very systematic facility, and one more thing these kind of facilities takes a lot of soul to be put there
if inverting terminal is grounded and the non inverting is also grounded, that means, it looks like we are virtually shorting the two ends of the op amp or the two input terminals of the op amp
now the next question that we would like to ask is that what are critical sections
so, that you are more clear about the particular theorem
without putting logics and place that why am i doing it what is the basic reason behind it
so, voltage will be induced your what we call in all this three different coil, which are 120 degree apart right, physically it is apart right
3 equations
if i wanted to have some time dependence on the problem, what would i need to do
so, when i have invoked print twice, once through object 1, and once through object 2, the value 10 has been added to x twice
in any case, i want to now calculate the vector potential for this
but then again on top of that comes who will be using what kind of stuff see for example, somebody is growing selves directly from animals what we call as primary culture which are much more prone to contamination because it is kind of a very you need very well trained person to take care of it
and when t is your increasing, when t is increasing this current actually approaching towards 0 and when t tends to infinity t is going to infinity right this term will vanish it will be 0
promoting and encouraging ip generation is quite lot of promotion and advocacy that happens through the ipm cell
then yet another method of achieving this linearity is what is known as feed forward linearisation
so, since the power delivered to the circuit is i square r therefore, at i is equal to we know that power i square r is the power delivered to the circuit therefore, suppose at i is equal to i 0 by root 2 say the power is 1 half of the maximum value which occurs at omega 0 right suppose suppose your this one we know i square r right, now when i is equal to say i 0 by root 2 then if this is the power loss p p is equal to i is equal to i 0 byroot 2 then it will be i 0 square r by 2 that is it will be half p by 2 right
therefore here your 3 i 2 dash square r 2 will be 829 minus 250 because that you have to make it, because that will be your actually rotor copper loss
one is the eda, electronic design automation, the next is the spice, that the ng spice and tcl spice have been installed, and then octave and we have installed it on afedora system
why does have to counter act
right, yes that is high speed train yeah, high speed white train travel very fast obviously more than 20 wheels
we will look at what are the different types of gazes, but in the context which we have decided upon for how many seconds we can safely look into the eyes of the other person without changing it into an intimidating gaze
these are intermediate priority tasks and once t1 blocks for the resource for t3, the intermediate priority tasks keep on executing one after the other and t1 keeps on waiting for t3 to be able to get the cpu, complete its execution, but by that time t1 misses its deadline
now listening to these comments, let us do a reflection spot
this is structural and this is physical or geometric domain
﻿welcome back to module 14 of programming in c++
but as we move away or towards the load, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient remains constant
now, once you what is the next step; next step is use spin coat photoresist
so with that, if you actually look at estimating hta, the torsional shear on wall a and torsional shear on wall b, if you remember again we need to consider that the torsional shear in wall a will reduce the total shear whereas will increase the total share in wall b
today we will discuss how to design the high pass filter
so this can be minimized, but this has been kept non means non minimized because of balancing the delays from inputs to outputs
so, in this way what would happen is that we are sending bit by bit from the sender to the receiver, so let us see how this program actually works
so on this side i show the capacitance and this is the width and this different plots that are shown
a parallel plate waveguide is a waveguide which has two parallel plates and these plates are infinity long and infinitely wide
the mate history in this assembly we can see here mates, what we have done is this the first coincidental mate that was between the edge of the two blocks and the second one thus mating of the origin of this block and the plane coordinate
then it is v b n it starts from here, and v c n of course it will come like this, but v b n and v c n that means, v a n is leading v b n by 120, v b n your leading v c n by 120 degree
each share is of 1 rupee
this is an example of suggestive interrogation, okay
in the second session we started with our discussion on financial statements
similarly, two to the power m is the total input bit streams
like we saw in the earlier case when i was explaining the 5 whys concept is the customer, person was getting his vehicle serviced wanted the service centre to be close to his home whereas the person who was servicing the vehicle, the company they wouldn’t have that
so the flip side is when you initialize you were initializing only the value of the first component because certainly here since you can have only one component, we have space for only one component the initialization cannot have a list of components list of constants to initialize different data members
so, if it is so, then in this case in this case i 2 dash square into r 2 dash is equal to i 2 square r 2, right that is r 2 dash is equal to my i 2 square up on i 2 dash square into r 2 that is i 2 upon i 2 dash your what you call square into r 2
so, alpha is
registration of ip: once the ip is identified and the institute takes a call to file intellectual property protection for it, then it has to be done usually it is done by teaming up with third party service providers
in this supply voltage is v 1 right
that would be one
this is one way of offset in the voltage be being that op amp differential gains are high the figure for input offset voltage does not have to be much effect on the output even though inputs are shorted right
so in this way we see that we have been able to work around our issue where there is this additional push present in the add gadget that we have found
so the voltage phasor would be 90 degree leading with respect to current and it has some value
now just an examples of performance specifications from north america, so you have here several different specifications for bridges and tunnels and so on very high profile structure
our digital body language as well as our on line presence has become a favourite tool for recruiters
so, now we can dope using either diffusion or ion implantation correct either diffusion or iron implantation; what we can do
what we have learned in that class mainly is how to use a dc standard cell to calibrate ac potentiometer, because there is no ac standard cell that is one important thing we have learned
so, when we have any current through this coil, the coil is turned and then this pointer is also turned, and it moves across along this scale
so that means i have to say, probably i have to look at the complete circumference of this particular core and if i say the average circumference is l, so i should say length of the core material or i would say on the other hand it is the magnetic field line is equal to l here
you actually use two flat jacks now, not one flat jack
we will get this particular wafer
so, these are all parallel lines that are expanding in the value of the 1 norm
he got his phd from the university of witwatersrand and his renowned expert in many aspects related to concrete science and technology, he has done lot of work on aggregate for concrete, on aggregate reactivity and has spent a lot of time working on durability
now, in triode regions is nothing, but your ohmic region, saturation region you know vds is greater than vgs minus v t and i d equals to k times vgs minus v t volts square and then there is cut off region
so, current is flowing here is i 1 right and if you consider this part it is i 2 minus i 1 right
n right e n is the farthest i can go in time in this equation
vds one equals to vds 2, implies io equals to i reference right, but the catch is here that, lambda for m 3 and m 4 is 0, but for m1 and m 2 is not equal to 0
now at this point, the queue is empty and since the queue is empty, i stop and i find that my square of interest namely 1 1 was not marked
you were rehearsing because you wanted to retain this information only till you could successfully dial it
so, by this way part of your basically, you can control this field current by adding a diverter, diverter means part of the current is diverted through this variable resistance, you can vary this
pause at this reflection spot, think about the answer, submit your answer and then we can resume
it's ac coupled to the gate of the transistor
and when i again connect, it has stopped that means it has connected
now in this case if you see y 12 is not equal to y 21 because y 12 you have calculated as minus of 0
if you remember the format, we will calculate first all items and at the end we write the payment of taxes
now, you can very legitimately ask me, as to why should somebody write this kind of a code that to answers to that what, one is what if somebody writes
in fact, while calculating forces on a given charge q, we had also calculated electric field due to a charge distribution, because if i take small q to be 1, it becomes the electric field
all right, what do you say
the stock prices fell from 30 to 20 and november it came to be known that they were overstating their profits for so many years and in just one month in december enron became bankrupt
this is the way we construct projections of lines, check our solution both the points a’ a on one side above that xy line
ok, similarly, there will be edges in between the other also, but the four imaginary ones and the way they are connected will be something like this
using z parameter
so, if i want to fabricate a capacitor, i can fabricate a capacitor by depositing an insulating film between 2 metal films or depositing 2 conductive film separated by an insulating layer
so when the bjat is on we give the base drive, bjt is on, the current flows through vn, bjat, inductor, charging of the induuctor in this path
based on how many sides we have we have different numbers
so, that control technique is different and another thing is that; that fixed capacitor is less expensive than switch capacitor switch capacitor is more expensive at least 2
so i had concluded my previous lecture presenting the different types of tests that are available in some codes and in the literature that examines shear strength of masonry and joint shear strength
this is the main advantage
and if you need to refer to books these are the couple of books that i will recommend you to follow
so, this is equal to k according to our previous notation ok, so this is spring constant
so, when e minus e f is 3 kt we can substitute and the numbers are 3 minus 3 k t the fermi function is 0
now if we apply the formula we just discussed in the previous section to each section now, so say we are considering we want to find out the input reflection coefficient
had it been an ideal transformer, what would be the value of rc and xm
from last several classes, i was telling you that we are learning a process, and i will show you in one of the lectures how we can fabricate a mosfet
you can even keep the book under your pillow and not read it at all perfectly fine
now let's see what could be the possible what 15 cost drivers, those are applicable for intermediate kokomo
like, what i was saying is that these are the points which were already there and this is the connection topology that we want and this is one possible interconnection that we do to achieve this
whereas, earlier in the example, we showed that the static data members are public which has encapsulation issues
so, it is a function of slip only and if you simplify it will be 2
again, first straight slot, click, do not hold any button, just freely move your mouse
and one thing is there this f2 f this what you call this f1, fr, f2 all are your what you call stationary with respect to each other this is also moving with ns, this is also moving with ns, right
, transform section approach has to be used for your design calculations and since we are working within the permissible stresses approach, your stiffness calculations have to be consistent with the limits that we assume for the working stress
2 volts and another difference is that the material is germanium, so that the band gap is smaller
when we load the machine what happens, so we will look at the implications as and then we look at the characteristics of the machine
so we started with the basic results that we wanted, desired results that we wanted and then the team started brainstorming on what all possible ideas there could be
also read, observe what you are seeing in the financial statement of your company and if you find any deviation than what we are teaching or if you feel that there is something more to discuss please put it on our discussion forum and you will be getting answers you can also discuss with other members of the class so today we are going to start with the module 3 as you can see it is on depreciation if you have minutely read the p&l account there is one item in p&l known as depreciation
so, let us go back to an intrinsic semiconductor
now let's check whether with this priority assignment of the rate monotonic scheduling, the task set will meet its deadline
again we have this symmetric object here and we would like to retain this part, remove this part
9 for which we have connected one shunt capacitor right
25 that is favorable and this all has happened because your actual if you look at the material information given in this case there are two three issues involved here why your variance has become favorable because you look at the say rates given here so it means the amount which we have calculated though the actual standard quantity was 2,000 kgis and we have used the actual quantity of say 2 020 but i think there is a difference in the price and if you calculate the price difference in case of this per unit of the standard if you calculate though the standard is given to us that standard price is 4 rupees and 3 rupees per but actual price i think it has come down in one of the materials and if you calculate that price given in this per unit of the material price if you see that actual price was 3 and the in case of the second one the actual price paid is 2
we looked at the a m n the matrix coefficient a m n in terms of the operator yesterday in the language of method of moments, that is the coupling coefficients so to speak that i have to evaluate
for example when you talk about us bank finance is the least popular source of providing the working capital finance as most expensive also
you will get delta n this way delta 1, delta 2, delta 3 all can be determinants can be computed, right
so, you will see the unit impulse function here
now 1 way that we saw in the previous lecture was there was a formula relating the z parameters to the s parameters we can use that so for any network we can first find out the z parameters or y parameters and then use that formula to find out the s parameters or if you want to know the s parameters and we want to find out the y parameters we can do the reverse
so, i should look at the reflection coefficient and see how to make it zero and that itself will tell me what values of e to set, should the modulus less than one equal to one greater than one
how about the corresponding magnetic field
so, z delta into i ab then, encounter is plus terminal first, plus v bn then, minus v an is equal to 0 right
the patent law in india and in other places follows the first file, it does not follow the first to invent principles
this is going to be the energy loss, right
when the base drive is given to this bjt, this transistor is on and you have the current flowing in this path
but which is u is not constant
so, how i writing p is equal to 500 horsepower and it is 7 power 0
so, instead of just going ahead and creating our own simulation let us first try to be curators
so there is a notion of stability in going from here to here ok
so, exactly this scattered field is outgoing right
so, that is why it is a function of theta i
so, this is v m and we know the average value of this v m is 5 volt
what is sublimation
so if you do this, what advantage you are getting
so, in most traditional constructions, its thick walls, thick peripheral walls that actually provided the resistance even to lateral forces
you should consider only from that time whatever 5 pointed above this because this is the time this is t is equal to 0
let us say it is not an inductor it is a spring, the spring is holding probably this piece of iron at some point which is away from this particular c shaped magnet
this edge and this edge are connected by a block and the height of this block, that will be the weight of this edge, this node, and this node, this, this is the block in between
and as i said every 5 minutes, these data will be sent through this microcontroller using a gsm module to some server
integration sine theta prime, cosine phi prime over r minus r d s prime in y direction
welcome to our nptel online courses on engineering drawing and computer graphics
this means rectangle j is on the left of rectangle i
we know we are producing hydroxyl ions at the steel and that attracts the alkali ions and we get alkali hydroxides around the steel which are beneficial that they are the ones who build up the passive layer on the steel
so, the flux lines are rotating, see this is rotating
i mean i leave it to you guys
so, f s if you have f s in the general form like f s has a numerator function that is ns divided by ds, where ns is the numerator polynomial and ds is denominator polynomial
so, if i write this over here it is incomplete in the sense that it does not tell me what it is doing on anything, it needs a force to act or a field to act on and that field in this case is a scalar field
this delta two p is the unbalance force that actually gives rise to the acceleration of this portion
so, if i apply vin of 1 volt at 5 kilohertz, then what will happen
now and wound rotor case, we will see the circuit diagram later has a 3 phase winding similar to the similar one of on the stator
interrupt is a mechanism like this; suppose, this is our processor board and from outside some interrupt is coming
in this particular module, we will continue on that polymorphic type
so, wherever you put r you calculate e i of r whether it is in v 1 or v 2 it is a numerical value right
so initially p loss, jj and q loss set to zero, or for all jj, then initial estimate of pm two and qm two will be the some of the loads of all the nodes beyond node m two plus the load of the node m two itself
so, for this circuit voltmeter reading is truly the voltage across the resistance, but for this circuit it was not so
it is also a little bit of a brute force method as we will see
but still there is a specific rate at which the speed will increase; it is not going to increase right away from 0 rpm to 1500 rpm
so we have two different ways of looking at the problem
this is a very, very important module
this is what will determine how temperature changes with time, given some boundary conditions, right
so, this 4
there is no right claimed in a word mark in a manner on how these words are presented
so, em is 550 times fm and that is 4,400 mpa
look at their projections like what is the front view, what is the top view, and how the side view really looks like
so generally orientation in many books they show the orientation exactly similar in the primary as well as secondary to show which is actually coupled to which one ok
25 minus we are given the actual time, actual time is how much, actual time is given to us is 875 and what is actually 8 that is 2
and there is a whole lot of decisions we need to make regarding visual communication and presentation
this speaker will be interfaced from port line d5, the ldr circuit output will be connected to analog input a1, and the lm35 sensor will be connected to analog input a0
so how we will write complex power s
but for the nc pin it is just the reverse
the shifty eye contact or an avoiding eye contact maybe fleeting or infrequent or frequent and infrequent alternatively
so, i have to be careful in terms of using this mouse, where i am going to really move and click that portion it construct arc up to that level
the standard labor weeks were 1,800s and actual labor weeks are how much
this insert function: again if it is empty then it just creates a singleton list otherwise it creates a new node and exchanges the first node and the new node
so, find it is resistance so, we know r is equal to v is equal to ir
so, this has to be kept in mind in the data structures you need to have a elaborate data structure that stores
for the parallel plate capacitor as shown in the figure 1, figure already i have shown, so c is equal to epsilon into a into d
if it is stuck at one, i have a, apply a zero, which means i am creating a change on this line
so, typically when your problem becomes a 3 dimensional problem, doing this lu decomposition itself becomes very tedious
the drawing board size is always be larger than this drawing sheet
you have to calculate the voltage regulation of a transformer having copper loss of 2 percent of the output and the reactance drop of 5 percent, when power factor is 0
a budgeted statement of monthly cash receipts and disbursements, that means the cash budget for each of the next three months and a budgeted balance sheet for the 31st august 2005, 15 or 17 or 18 whatever you deem it
so, it is the closing stock of wip is 15,000 put it in the inner column directly and then say subtract it
so, p is equal to plus vi current enter is your negative terminal p is equal to minus vi
k squared, what term will come now this is segment 2 element 1; i mean shape function 1, what will i come now so, this is 1 2 3 4
segment is there but large segment in this in a part of this entire part of this country is of the market of the small cars
and next, when we look at multilayer, routing means we have more than two layers available with us
given the values, you can design a circuit; and given a circuit, you can find out the values
i square
welcome to module 5 of programming in c++
so, you understand that it is not difficult to understand this technique
our movements etcetera can be misinterpreted when we have to communicate across cultures and most of them are carried out with little awareness and therefore, we find that our kinesic expressions present the truth about our emotions and feelings
so, for them, purchase of car will fall in, will go in fixed assets in the balance sheet
so what we need actually is to have a composite update operation which sets the date by providing all three values, rather than supplying three separate operations to update the three fields separately
second thing is we are not given the output, that how much output was, how much input was given, how much output is expected that information is also not given to us
some people might even go for, you know, ordering things, things, putting things in certain orders, in certain hierarchy
2 kva 220 volts by 110 volts transformer, corresponding to 220 volts i have only 10 ampere as the rated current
we shall go to the applications, start up the geda schematic
so if we look at the other signals, here we see this signal for the interlayer water
so, how can i reduce the thickness of the substrate
so, term a evaluates to minus 4 j then we come to term b ok
that is still available and accessible to all of us
so, the average compressive stress is the axial force divided by l into t and from vertical equilibrium we now have equilibrium provided by the stress block itself
now for potentially unstable case, let us see how to design for potentially unstable case
now, there is a question, how negative charges accumulating in the substrate negative charges accumulating substrate
you can instead of fixed assets you can also take average total assets if you want to know the return on total assets
the advantages of op amps are it is low cost, right less power consumption, more compact, more reliable, high gain and easy design
so, we want i, i plus k, i plus 2 k and so on, we do this by giving a third argument
so in a moore machine the output depends only on the state variables, ah, but in contrast, in the milli machine, the output depends not only on the state but also on the present input
we are given this closing balance sheet
similarly, from here to here also we are showing outside and here to here also outside
and then after two or three hours the rate of heat evolution starts to increase again to a maximum at about ten hours and then it decreases
till then you take care, have a nice day, bye
so, it means this cost becomes 17 lakhs and 60,000s
so we are going to look at actually if you look at electrical to mechanical energy conversion, one of the examples is an actuator or a relay
in coincident mate the two things that we we want to assemble or mate will coincide
because the true critical paths will actually determine the minimum cycle time for which the circuit will function
v d s on the other hand continues to be a sinusoid
so how do we track the performance of the child
so, in this case, the rotor is also composed of punched lamination these are carefully you are stuck to create a series of rotor slots to provide space for the rotor winding
this is what happens when you have iron and it is corroding
so, from a b we draw a horizontal line first, first of all we we draw a horizontal line, with respect to that 30 degrees here and with respect to that 30 degrees
in the next lecture we will also, look at arbiter puf and we will also, compare the ring oscillator puf and the arbiter puf and see what are the characteristics and where each one can be used, thank you
but internally if you are looking that projection whatever we are getting on the 3rd quadrant that mirror, if we flip it see that we will get that projection
so the free space uhh will be much more as respect to rcc and also as it is lighter
this that is why; in most of the cases, you will see that people do not use passive filter because there is aof the loading effect, in clearly see a loading effect coming into play if we keep on increasing the frequency
so, how these equation for different from previous ones was because of the coupled nature and also these are boundary integrals
0 ah 0
i could be an given a state of mind for a relatively longer period of time which runs into months, weeks, days or couple of hours
and when we are looking from top view this a to f line always be visible, we join it, and c to d also visible, so we join that
so a is here, e is here, i is here
then, why i am introducing such an idea of a field
so, call that one as p 2
even if you are using something minimal like an html page, the same idea can be used that you sequence some content either video or text content followed by an learning by doing activity followed by the next piece of content and so on
once you click on the desired week, you will find all the learning dialogues for that week numbered sequentially
then next one, what we are going to look at this va control
vector is in the positive z direction because i am going counter clockwise: d x, d, y and this gives me the area of the unit circle and therefore this is minus pi, r square minus two pi
so, therefore, we can say that the resistor is a linear element, because if voltage current relationship satisfied both homogeneity and additivity properties right
you try to try to avoid from falling into the local minima because there can be another minimum which is even better
this is the way the line in 3 d supposed to look like
we are integrating over e 1 this is your expression for u u and u 1
so, if i do this what is the next step
so, data bus is connected d 0 to d 7 and the address bus lines a 0 to a 7 are multiplexed with d 0 to d 7
similarly, unit ramp is integration of unit step function and unit step function is integration of unit impulse function
now, what is interesting is the next one, where we actually partially specialize this
so, in this case let me clear it in this case that v 1 and e 1 balance is lost because it is on it is on your what you call, it is on loaded, secondary side is loaded the and and v 1 if you look into the circuitjust first let me explain here
always take a real life example, metal, what you see right how the current comes or how the power comes to your home through some wires
the potential in this case is specified on the boundary and charges are given outside
lets, i have a setup, flip flop, register r one
if you remember, we discuss that accounting is a language of business
16v for 4
what was my original objective
and what is that, i1 is 25 microampere per milliwatt of incident radiation, this much is the current that we can generate
so, with h length we will connect these points and join it like a box, always parallel to our principal axis
so i can have actually on one side i can have electrical energy input and it is going to go through a magnetic via media because actually the magnetic medium is not going to contribute towards any energy directly, it is only serving as a conduit between the electrical energy and mechanical energy
so, let us join freehand sketch
so, this is known this v 1 is given ok
what we saw in this example is a new kind of loop
and the point to note is that when you have a large system, usually the total circuit is divided across a number of printed circuit boards, whereby we get the system
but what happens is if the value of rl changes, if you choose a different load resistance, the gain will change
so, equation for h y was the following
so, synchronous motor is not going to be self starting
so, 20 kilo neuton per meter cube into the width of the wall
in the case of pictorial drawing it represents 3 sides of an object in one view
it is also interesting to note that thumb gestures are secondary gestures and they are always a part of a cluster, they are never independently read
the next part when we are constructing it in centimeters, if we are not careful enough these objects we may not be in a position to make and there will be a problem
during global routing, as i said you recall our earlier lectures the entire routing region, or space that is available on the chip, that is typically partitioned into a set of rectangular routing regions
let us call this is a mirror
so, if you see here you have the c1 and r1 these are in parallel
so we could actually have an arrangement
so i will have energy and co energy to be equal to each other
so, we will advise that you use some ide, which is open source
so, the contribution margin has got reduced by this amount
these are materials which do not have any polarization by themselves, but if they are put in a medium, in electric field, not in the medium
in the mikami tabuchi algorithm, along the lines, i am looking at every grid points and i am running so many perpendicular lines along each of the grid points
we feel threatened when somebody intentionally or accidentally encroaches upon this bubble
now, we are using that internal structure
content is given by your sme already
when i talk about long term stability, then what we see is, basically due to aging of crystal material
so, hence only half of this band is full
now, vs gets divided between these impedances and r1 parallel r2 to give you vgs and vgs gives you v0
npv as the short form is npv and p v is transferred this net present value
it is elements for example voice, speed, pitch, pause, rhythm, volume, stress and tone modify the meanings of what we have to say and at the same time at nuances to the spoken word
we use the same trick
not surprising, i started with a vector in the z direction curl of it give me something in the x y plane right, so this is my equation
because angular line between 0 and a 360 degree so, and it is moving your either here we are taking anticlockwise either clockwise or anticlockwise what isoever the phasor is a rotating vector right
so prototyping building is to test the assumptions again there was a new assumption that came up, that was also added to the list, so they are going to go to the field to test these assumptions, one more point i would like to point out is they had now they have three potential users of the same system, so you can take a pic on which is your favourite or you think is the most important stakeholder in this and you can build a prototype for them, as the assumptions for them
then you are doing this estimation
so, what will happen in c, if as c overrides them
let us begin our session
but, it is not enough to stay with the tools, we need to also design explicit learning activities along with these tools or around these tools which actually require learners to work with their peers and effectively learn from each other
so here one is: the hole means bolt hole, hole due to bolt
so, in these critical conditions you need to assist the quality of concrete by means of its gas penetrability characteristics
so, this is a right hand, right travelling wave let us call this term over here what do what would be call this term over here inside the phasor
now i am going to calculate over this path number three
so in this case, if i write, if i may call this as v1, if i make all this as v2, i am going to have v1 by v2 equal to n1 by n2, but i cannot write this is equal to i2 by i1 because it is open circuited, i am not going to have any current on the secondary side literally, yes
some codes go empirical, some codes link it to the tensile strength, the compressor strength of the unit
so, if you remember what we said in the earlier slide is that if the scheduling points are generated by a clock interrupt, these are called as clock driven scheduler
we look at this from a global perspective, the differences in how we interpret the expression of emotions when they originate in other cultures
so, we'll stop here and in the next session i'll be showing you the solution
see we are now connecting a potentiometer between pins 5 and 1
so, when we talk about op amp ias a peak detector, the first thing that you have to see is the function of the peak detector
then you move forward gauss began to study magnetism
so, if you now look at the first destruction message is for the object d2, that is this message
tthe frequency of oscillation generated by lc tank circuit is the frequency generator by lc will depend on what
similarly, we discussed practice and feedback and when you did the learning by doing activities, you saw that there was customized feedback, some of it was constructive, it pointed you to the various resources that you could go back and look at in case you are learning by doing activity response was incorrect
so, after that at v draw a perpendicular vb is equal to vf a perpendicular vb is equal to vf, vb is equal to vf means this is vf here
04 this is 1000, so you have to find out
material of interest the high energy of electron beam is transferred to the material which causes is to start evaporation or evaporating
so, the first questions says what is the hole concentration at 300 kelvin
since we have 3 unknown here r, l and c, we will fix one value r
of course
in other words, we add at one end and we remove at another end
so, i started with some frequency domain version of the permittivity which is the dispersive nature
so total disbursements for purchases
so, n i we got in first part of this question, mu e and mu h we just calculated
ok, so the block will rotated in this fashion
so, again there is a vast theory of approximate methods, but again in cem what we will try to do is give you an exact way of calculating this, there is more it is more work, but it is a more rigorous than in the other case
now, there is a new alternative to it, there is something called experience sampling method, esm, now what happens unlike the traditional questionnaire technique the paper pencil based technique or the computer assisted techniques, basically participants they fill out questionnaires at random time points throughout the day to measure the process in real time
so after eight unit of from this point to this point, it is eight
without commenting on the political belief systems, i have tried to use this video as an illustration of genuine and fake smiles
now from 5 it will come back and it will go back to 3 now from 3 it will go progressively in the front to 6 from 6 it will come back to 4
so, if you are interested you can read more on that
so, i will tell you what are substrate holders i will show it to you substrate holder is the is the equipment or a tool that can hold the substrate, that can hold the substrate right now i have to evaporate this metal right and deposit on these substrates right
actually it is much simpler to print all solutions than it is print a single solution because we do not have to remember whether our solution extends or not it is really running through every possible solution
now if you simplify, what you will get r2 plus r1 by r2 into i1, so finally what is the value of i1
so, we are not going to a redo all of it; obviously, we just want to see conceptually where does the paths diverge in the derivation
so if the gcd is one then then at most after one time unit the task can occur
so, nothing is drawn after these right; nothing is drawn r 1 and x 1 put it here and this is the current i 0
now, if z0 for the transmission line is kept constant, then we see that zin is proportional to the inverse of rl
so, these pins are vcc, x, y, z and gnd
so, why i will spend more time on this directly i will do it
if you come to the circuit from the circuit only, because this we have to use again and again for solving your numericals
so if there are, say, hundred test vectors at to do this process hundred times right
in this video capsule we shall look at the waveforms, some critical waveforms of the forward converter
and it is very critical that you explore and a slowly get more and more familiar with this standard template library, so that your power in being able to write good c++ code also improves
so, term 1, apply a radiation boundary condition, our aim is to formulate a system of equations with some of the form a x is equal to b, i want to solve and get the fields everywhere
therefore, we look for if we want to see if i j squares under attack we check whether it is row i is one or column j is 1 or j minus 1, diagonal is 1 or i plus j diagonal is 1
so, varying these kind of objects i will be in a position to construct a surface
so, at any arbitrary angle, i can really construct a plane
so, here we are counting the reference signal within one period of the; input and in normal counting here we are counting this is the input receipt we are counting the input signal within one period of the gate signal
let me call this side as plus, this side as minus; let me zoom in plus and minus
this is the circuit through which the current will be flowing
what it means is it is a reduction in the value of fixed asset or it is reduction in the utility of that particular asset due to variety of reasons
this variance is of 2,000 and that can be
so, it will be now root 2 pi f n phi max this is 4
so, i told you this equation will be v is equal to v m divided by t by 4 into t this is also same thing for this one
that is one application; other application could be detecting for example, what is called structural health; so, structural health of what
so, if mm calculated when you are in region 1 calculated thus is greater than the external moment that the wall is subjected to, then you have a wall cross section that is designed sufficiently to address the pm expected on the wall
the 1st device that i would like to discuss is the tee
so, this integral is over #a and it is the coupling between what and what
so cement paste basically binds the aggregate together primarily because of c s h, okay of course all the other hydrate products like calcium hydroxide, ettringite, monosulphate they are also filling a porosity which leads to an enhancement in the structural characteristics but the primary binding capacity is provided by c s h, so progressive loss of the structure of c s h can lead to a major deterioration in the characteristics of the concrete
another microcontroller board is pic microcontroller board
so, this is my conduction band ec, this is my valence band – ev, and i have a contact potential at the junction
and draw a vertical line to locate this projector this is the projector, and our c' is already on x axis, xy axis so c'
if you substitute then v0 will be 2
i just go ahead, click the second one, done
so, this will be 42 into 0
we had if you remember a function capital phi of t and h that is what we had said, and then later we said that when we choose a particular testing function this would become say t m
so, we can take let us say the curl of the first equation over here right
similarly when main ends only after that all the static data members of all classes will start getting destructed in the reverse order in which they were constructed
so, we will be going ahead today with the say a detailed discussion on flexible budgets so why we need the flexible budgets because of the limitations of the master budget so in the master budget for example what we did say we were preparing the budgets and we were given the sales level we have already forecasted the level of sales and if you talk about the value of the sales sometime we were writing that say for example in the months, we have the sales of say 7 lakh rupees or dollars or maybe 4 lakhs or maybe something like that for the different months we were talking about
in the second figure what we are trying to do, we are trying to find out the voltage amplitude with respect to time
for omega greater than omega c, gamma is real and hence e to the power minus gamma is real and negative and this corresponds to stop them
supposing i take this most general form of hankel function and put inside over here
and then of course, this circuit is therefore, better because the current through the ammeter most of it goes through this resistance and a very little amount goes through this voltmeter ok
but in many cases what happens, you are into a bulk production scenario
at the same time we find that proxemics also identifies the ways in which people bank on their cultural background to suggest how a particular spacing can pass on feelings and emotions related with their confidence, how much distance can create annoyance amongst people
this a is being fed to all this, all these three blocks
so, this fluctuating because he is holding with hand, in reality you do not have to hold with hand
so if the drain current of the transistor happens to be more than the desired current, then the source voltage must be increased
and so suppose this point, where the this value of frequency for which the input the gamma n modulus is equal to gamma m, i call that electrical angle theta m
and whatever is the increase in the field energy that is just incidental, i am not intending to really do it but it is just incidental
so, at equilibrium you have a barrier that is setup that prevents any further motion
then you can just write on the forum you can take up and discuss that
so, if you are not given the clear cut information about the c or s or fixed expenses or profit or variable cost and sales then you can calculate the pv ratio
now once we have this template we can construct many instances of it
once that is done, through 1 dash draw a line parallel to ab
it is carried out at 1150 to 1200 degree centigrade
so, this is the question we are asking now and the answer is actually right in front of us ok
so, on the drawing sheet, we always measure in terms of x coordinate, y coordinate kind of information
but as it turns out
985 is equal to your this is the 100 kva transformer right
there is another row of cells, there is another row of cells like this
you may have a promoter group or a controlling group
so, head always be a circular one
you talk about manufacturing sector, you talk about electronics, you talk about automobiles, you talk about domestic that is the consumer products
so the max voltage that the capacitor will ever see will be vrms into root 2
then is the disbursement of purchases
from this diagram only right magnitude u 2 so; that means, your what we call mod val is equal to v l upon root 3 cos here what we call root cos 30 is equal to 3 by 2
so, in the symmetric mate, we can see here two little windows
similarly for agreeableness the extreme possibilities are, you are high at it or you are low at it
and, usually it is not necessary that we have to connect these vertices only by lines, they can be connected by curves also
i think that will be pretty straight forward
that means this your resistance is that is your you we got r 2 dash by s
in this module, we will continue our discussion on the smith chart and also see some applications of the smith chart in impedance matching
and this in turn as you know the amplitude of intermodulation products is equal toé so from here we get this a in i p 3
and another possibility could be that the previously learnt thing and the new coming thing both of them are completely disconnected
there is a threshold value below which the material behaves as an led an above which behaves as a laser
so, to find the induced emf we need to compute the rate of intersection of this conductor side with the flux lines
but we have to it should be actually physically possible
there is a time delay in the response of that equation 57 right
so, this is what the closed loop gain inverse infinite differential gain we have seen it is nothing but zero infinite input impedance, which is, vminus divided by r1 right, because r 1 is the input
now let us see a line consider a line here under the south pole and apply the right hand rule again
second is videos, when you can sit back and simply watch it at your own speed, your own time
you can call net furniture and fixtures that is 1,000
is it cosmetic getting attention or others
suppose we want to implement our own version of the list, a list is basically a sequence of nodes and each node in the sequence stores a value and points to the next node
there could be that in some cases, the names that are same between two developers’ programs or code means the same thing; in some cases, same name as used by savitha, will be used by niloy in a different meaning
power supply range may be the differential or single ended power supply kind, we have seen in the starting of this lecture
so, it will become v m i m by 2 minus v m i m by 2 cos 2 omega t
earlier days, people used to go with t squares, so it is in the form of t
so, if i take any element so, there is a kind of a local numbering every element has a local 1 and a 2 left and right
maybe half percent, maybe 1%, maybe 2%, maybe 5%
this is what we wrote as the speed torque equation, right
so, this is not some noise which is horn noise or which is a chopper noise or which is some honking right or which is some loudspeaker or very loud music, but these are the noises which are present in the electronic form
so, that i can apply huygen’s principle to find out the field everywhere, but when you do fdtd i have to find out the fields everywhere in space, from that only take out what is along the edges
rather than this if i had defined everything in terms of per unit, the per unit basically define everything with respect to its own base, it doesn’t really change it in any other way
if there is a crisis, nobody would mind seeing astrologer and knowing what is this planetary condition
so, i will have actually if i try to look at it, the drop will not be linear, it is going to be non linear as far as the armature reaction drop is concerned, we are going to discuss armature reaction in a little greater detail
now, let us assume as before that we have a common divisor for both m and n
the role of color is important and therefore, we can say that colors hold a certain power in business and professional world
so, in part a, we want to calculate the built in potential of this junction
now, if i say rsb this stands for reverse subtract this means r2 r1
so what is the sales value now
the most basic instructions are addition and subtraction
now, we had seen that an idf has different parts
now, before going to investing activities, we also would like to understand how are the operating activities reported
so let's make different situations
the default option here is highlighted as you have to pick first point, second point, some inclination angle 3
second is modifying transition times to improve the signal integrity
so we look at into the overall picture in this lecture
similarly at the end of the year, we have to show that on the last day of the year if it is 31 march if it is 31st december or any other year or the end of that period of 12 months on that last day of the year or that last day of the operating period of 12 months the balance sheet must be in the state of balance all the assets must be equal to the liabilities plus capital or the liabilities plus capital must be equal to the assets
now if we if we consider that this network is both lostless and reciprocal then what happens, so lostless and reciprocal
this is the equation from which this concept of clockwise or anticlockwise movement follows
now the next thing is to choose the frame size
it is normal
supposing, we have a date, a date is typically a three component field which has the day, month and year
so this is my synchronous speed no matter what whatever is my torque
so, past pattern of sales is the first important factor which we always bear in mind for forecasting the sales or the sales estimation for the future
so, this is the this is the demultiplexed address bus this is the demultiplexed data bus ale signal is connected to the g pin of 7 4 3 7 3 psen bar line is connected to oe bar and cs bar line is grounded and this ea bar line is grounded
so, the focus as i said is primarily from the earthquake response of such earthquake earthquake response of reinforced concrete frames
because we are to see whether it is melting or not
7 radians per second
so, we can substitute all the values, we can use k in the si units, but then we need to divide by 1
so you actually want the system to have a motor remove the i r filter from the lens directly
my substrate is internally connected to my source, that is why you will find that there are only three terminals in most of the mosfet i cs that you can get from the market all right very easy super easy right
but for f j, which is stuck at one in the output, so any test which makes output zero will be a test for this fault, because i am trying to check whether the output is stuck at one or not
we make those parameters constant whereas, on the output side we use just the call by reference mechanisms, so that we do not need that indirect pointer part, but this is just a matter of detail with the points to note is all these five have the same name and all these five can be used by the respective actual parameters with the same name
this is called as armature reaction drop
the first international arrangement on copyright was the berne convention in 1886
this is exactly the kind of feedback that you want
what will be the summation of these two
so, naturally this is not appropriate view and what we have to pick is this one as the good view
this is about 60, 70 kilometres from pune, india, and these are the set of 2200 year old caves, about 20 odd caves mainly for prayer, meditation and served as living quarters here for the monks
so, just see the difference, here it is written like this, here it is or if i write it like this
let's say id initially was smaller than i 0
when you say, write s says take the string s and write it to a file
these are specimens that is attached with aluminium plates so we cut out rectangular aluminium plates on the gripping area and we ebbed them or we fix them with epoxy regions and we let them cure for 1 day, then we are doing the test after that
the continuity and quality of electric service depend largely on whether the conductors have been properly installed
hence none of the learning outcomes mentioned here and effective learning outcomes, and let us see how we can convert them into effective learning outcomes
now and this is the relationship between v o and v n which is coming from this so, this is coming from the external circuit ok
they have a voting right to appoint the board of directors for managing the company
so, our question is how should the scheduler maintain the list of pending jobs and their priorities
so, in the diagram this you will know by mistake i have made it here also, but for you have to find out this rab
so, this is the important observation
so, whenever a free form of curve is required, we use these french curves; even for wood making and cutting, people use metallic french curves to get nice finish
have i made a mistake somewhere
so, this guy can be taken out over here
these are the simple calculations you can do to predict or compare two systems, right
36 kilowatt hour
this was the first time when monolithic ics or monolithic operation amplifier was available commercially, and it was successful
so, that we do not get lost when we are going to understand what exactly the mosfet fabrication is, and how they are applied in different applications
these zones are not compartmentalized very strictly there may be minor variations
so this on the 90th day total all the tax of the dividend must be sent must be reaching to the shareholders and they cannot to retain it beyond that
but this same design, when it comes down to physical view, it can be one chip representing the processor, there can be another chip representing the first memory, ah chip representing the second memory, and may be two chips representing the i
normally, center lines are not shown; because many isometric drawings are used to communicate to non technical people and not for engineering purposes
similarly when you get your r 1 3, you come to come to this circuit when you come to your r 1 3 right
so, because of which i can say the current is mainly dependent upon rl only, nothing else, okay
this is what leads to the class template which is parameterized with type and may have parameterized member functions
because you know that this particular circuit is a linear circuit
you have to look into the layout
again, you see that nothing more has to be done because the gate voltage is fixed, the source voltage is increasing, so that means that the moment you make this connection, if id is smaller than i 0, the source gate voltage vsd will increase
so, r t is equal to actually 0, for t less than equal to 0 and r t is equal to t for t greater than equal to 0 right that is why; minus infinity to t u t d t is equal t into u t
fourier
you know it's a large mirror, so point, three meters, that's roughly one foot times one meter
so, the function corresponding to the assignment operator is this function
so, if i go inside the object what is the interpretation
so there we say alpha equal to one
so, what do we have to then do we have to do this
so, i am going to have each of them getting the peak of the emf slightly delayed from each other
so, with this in mind how do i write the field
so, this is equation 10 right
the coordinator presents each expert with a specification and an estimation form
so, let us see from this side so, this is one coil, so these are the turns, and these are the two ends of the coils, this white insulated thing are the two ends of this coils
and if you remember our fc is 159
so, in the next class, we will learn more about these true shapes and auxiliary planes and then, begin with projection of solids
now, let us try and do this again, supposing i repeat this thing and now i do this again, now nothing happens the reason nothing happens is because we had this sequential reading of the file
75a for intermediate batten and d will be greater than a for end batten and for any case d should be greater than 2b so this we have to maintain now let us come to the spacing of the batten spacing spacing between two batten this is given in clause 7
what i want to mean for this circuit for this circuit right for this circuit , that when switch was not close, it was open initially, suppose capacitor was this capacitor was charged at voltage v 0 right
this led us to choosing our s of the form p plus j q right because its e to the minus j omega t
so you have to choose core of a particular permian's
if this is like say half ohm is this is like half a ohm and this small resistance is like 1 ohm then actually between these 2 terminals i have total of 2 ohm resistance
this is called a stick diagram because each line is represented by a line of, ok, zero width
so we will just ensure this even though our function does take care of this
but taking the production from the place of production to the purchase of the sale, place of production to the place of sales will not be possible
so, without doing the math, what do you intuitively expect
so, this is slight difference between loop and mesh, but loosely sometimes, we talk either loop or mesh, right, but this is the difference between the loop and mesh ok
so, this will be coming here and going to the latch and of course so other things the alternate input function and alternate output functions
so, in this case, so, when this coil is moving, this coil is moving right and it
but now, two thousand onwards, with the advent of battery operated mobile devices, portable devices, power as become a very important fourth parameter in this design space
so, this is controlling torque and then we have talked about the equilibrium condition, what is an equilibrium condition
so there are works which can help you arrive at semi emperically estimating in plane strengths and in plane stiffnesses which then contribute to modeling the interaction of the panel with the frame in your seismic analysis and design of reinforced concrete frames
you can either find the value of current or voltage with the help of super position theorem and then finally calculate the value of power after getting the value of current and voltage
then we have some part of it, which is the mantissa, and the other part, which is the exponent
this is s and g and d, sorry, and if g is zero then the switch will be disconnected
you can see a whole silicon boule and then you see an engineer working on this silicon boule
and similarly, you will get v average is equal to same 0
there is there is x and t is the vertical dimension
and because the surrounding concrete is older, and may contain a few chlorides, it is a natural position for the anode to stop
now, when the force is acting on the body with mass m the equation which you can write for the law which we just saw is supposed this is the mass of symbol m
in an lxi, the focused question and subsequent discussion is followed by a short graded activity called reflection quiz or rq to ensure your participation on the discussion forum
now, since kcl and kvl, both are valid for complex number
those who would like to take it a particular course
let us see, there is a change; so, easy to identify whether it is npn or pnp, all right
here what i do is i set the fields equal to 0 remember this is how equivalent problem it is not a physical problem
so, we can give a list and ask for to go through each value in that list or we can generate a sequence of n values by using the range function
that is true that is true
they noted that certain expressions occur and go even before we become conscious of them and they gave them the name micro momentary facial expressions
you may have to go back and try an alternate path
now, what i will show is that every nonlinear element can be replaced by a linear equivalent and the resulting equations will of course be the same as what you would get if you expanded every non linearity in a taylor series and neglected higher order terms
for items like profit on sale of investments, there will be two adjustments
so probably this will face, if especially if i am talking about a field rotating in anticlockwise direction like this
when you prepare the purchase budget, we apply this formula
so, locate this point v by knowing c and f, once this cv vf is known we are going to construct the rest of the parabola ok
now, let us find out this moving coil in my instrument
so my objective is to minimize the size or the cuts, the cut size number of lines which are cutting
so, this is your 10 ohm and this is your 20 ohm
2 mm and then steel fibers 0
so it is always good to insert buffers in between, so at to decrease the overall propagation delay
the rest of the sense modalities they have not been examined as thoroughly as the first two and then the third one
once you have these glass cover slips ready, now you are good to go to coat them with different kind of proteins what part of which we have talked about you have laminin ornithine actually rather ornithine laminin because you put the ornithine first followed by laminin, you have collagen, you have poly d lysine which is a synthetic substrate
so, with that i conclude this part which is a second special topic that i am addressing within module 5
all those things are studied under portfolio management
so, this is equation 36 right; that means let me move little bit up
so if you see the phasor diagram it is clear that voltage is having 90 plus phi with respect to real axis and it is having 90 degree leading with respect to current
and i am calculating force due to twelve charges and therefore the net force is going to be f
so i can mention this a little differently or much more easily as though i have connected these things like this and i am calling basically this as the star point, this as the star point and this also is the start point
right so, if there is some facet which is angled at a certain way the wave will go off at the same time
so, only those which are less risky they may take, which are more risky the project manager just simply what rejects those projects
so, ones you have developed you have sharpened your analytical ability and you have understood the methods that have that scientific flavor used by psychologists and used by and large in behavioral research you would very easily be able to consider it fine all though this appears and commonsensically this is what one can deduce you yourself would not like to go ahead with that deduction the reason being that you still you doubt that this is more and more of a commonsensical thing rather than being more and more scientifically sound observation much later when we come to methods of psychology they there even we will be talking about observation is a method
things which they were very masochistic about
so, this is delta e and the steady state feedback this r coming here left hand side it is like this, but as we are taken to this side this side that that is why it is your what you call this way it is minus r, so minus delta f
but sometimes like in nowadays, but in earlier days i used to write in mobile phones
now, the next important question, very important question can you guess; this is the last thing; why the secondary of a pt potential transformer should never be can you guess, open circuited
it is not a sale of goods or it is not a supply of services done by us
and from the source terminal to ground we have the capacitor c3
when you start using the oscilloscope, first thing that you have to do is, you have to compensate the probe;
we can miss an edge, we can have an extra edge from the next or previous cycle
if we can focus on the breadboard, he will be applying a bias voltage +vcc and vcc to the operational amplifier
so, what i'm going to be looking at is the hysteric behavior, right
so here is like, if you make a concrete using csa cement because of the formation of ettringite crystals, there is a loss in slump
so, in order for you to answer whether or not this integral is convergent or divergent, this is again a bit of revision from calculus what you should do is, you should break this up as minus a to eta 1 by x dx plus epsilon to b 1 by x dx and is there a term that i am missing over here
so, if you so supply is given to l voltage side and you have to suppose in the laboratory you have 110 by 220 volt
this gives rise to some emissions
now, let us look at this is a us application and you saw the structure of the us application
so on, from bottom there can be a signal s in, and from top three can be a signal s out
125 square root of f prime m fm and the maximum value there irrespective of the compressive strength is 0
if i draw for under compounded may be i am going to draw it like this, and if i am drawing for differentially compounded dc generator, literally is will reach 0 v
so, based on the 3rd quadrant system, if we are trying to make it and using glass door kind of box method, un opening that unfolding these things, this is the way we get
so, it is v l right, it is a line voltage and i a l is equal to line current i a l is equal to i a it is the line current it is line voltage and line current
whether it is maruti, volkswagen or any of them gasoline based cars all of them generally use a dc series motor for cranking up
so there is no, no charge taken on the inner surface
depending on the strength and stiffness of the spanrel, the boundary condition of the peer is established
right now, this is the rough floorplan that i have arrived, that while in terms of the house, again, i can say this four will be my drawing room, this seven and this two will be my, ah say, bedrooms like that, this one can be my kitchen, and so on
now below this we can make the account for may
88, j is equal to given everything is given right
ok, so the idea is this
so the point is this id depends depends on vgs, it does not depend on vds
this is other side of the coil, this is side a and this is side b and by sub means, it is called prime number say this coil is revolving, it is rotating in the anticlockwise direction
and i quote, “the young in the old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the same state of mind by the same movements”
in the sense that there is no expiry date attached too so, managers are constantly looking at how they can convert a limited life ip into an unlimited life ip
so, it is not mated because this item is fixed and we have already aligned this edge with the edge of this
now, i can i mean i have everything right
so, for bridge construction also constructing these parabolic curves and determining what should be this rope length from one point to other point is very much required; unless we construct the parabola, we will not be in a position to know how much length it is supposed to have for the load distribution
so if i want to propagate a signal from one line, let say from here, so along this path, so i have to apply non controlling value to the other inputs along the gates
now, let me compile this program, you save it by default
so, though i prepared these columns in the previous class also, let us do a fresh and we will be doing here is something like say purchase budget
in other words, we although there are infinitely many different possibility as factors we don't have to look at any number bigger than m, because it cannot go into m evenly
so this is also stationary whereas the conductor will be rotating and simultaneously the slip rings will also be rotating
and dw by dq is equal to v and dq if that is d dw by dq is equal to v that is from equation 1
so, that is why, all sum it up right and if you solve this v 0 plus 132 volt right and i 0 plus is equal to from the circuit only v 0 plus by 60
sir, is it 2d green's function
so, now is the part where we will have to apply integration by parts
so, we will see which is npn, which is pnp based on beta which is current gain
so, depending on the value of t c, either d or s d is selected
so the memory chunks are present within the heap, now let us 1st look of an example of how an arena is used
so, if you see this particular figure, all our voltages are 120 degree from each other
but after this restructuring, your actual arrival time of output is becoming five
so, almost 2 to the per 4, that is 16 times
so, we just add this red code
as you can see, if you compute the sum of all the edges, five plus two plus six plus seven, this will be more than three plus two plus three plus five
so, now what we can write at time t is equal to 0 v not v0 can be written as 1 upon c integral minus infinity to 0 i dt and that will be equal to v not because this is our initial condition
let me actually write that below, so i can draw the diagram
so, you keep going
some of the sales are left uncollected which will be collected over the next months and that amount of the sales which is made in the current quarter but not collected is called as what we call it as they are called as the accounts receivables because of the sales receivables
and i have a pointer p, which is of type a, so the pointer p points to this
then for say producing the 810 units, how many man hours are required
okay, so that's the second mechanism, the third mechanism
and the csa cement which was used in the study had this phase composition twenty percent ye'elimite, thirty five percent c2s, belite, and calcium sulphate in all forms was around forty percent
standard cost of labour is 18,000 rupees, you are going to call it as rupees 18,000, standard cost of labour is rupees 18,000 and here it is the 21,800 and 21,875 which is given to us
so, once you do all that simplification i can just condense it into a new constant k 1 squared as the wave number in the region 1 phi 1 r is equal to i will get a j omega mu naught j z r just rewritten everything, region 2 is follow the same recipe ok
so, using these two equations you can create the equivalent electrical circuit which will represent the mechanical system which was given in the example
so, it is easier here this in positive plus you see minus right plus minus or here plus minus
here vm is 120 im is 10 and and cos theta v is 45 and theta i is minus 10
so you are allowing doglegs but you may required some additional columns in the process, as this example shows right
so, in current ratio it was current assets upon current liabilities
so, at this position there is no flux linkage at that particular instance it is revolving, it is revolving it is given it is revolving say by some means we are making it to rotate right
so, these are the variables which you do not control over
so, update the list in position 2 by the value of z
like earlier, it is very important to set up a clear learning activities that learners can do on the wiki
ok, so let us look at some of these methods one by one
so, the point is that is why we had to use the mems in gate sensors
you have the amplification of 1 + (r2 / r1)
let us consider the front view of the object is this one, so that we will see these ends something like a rectangular block
but we have considered one minus sign before it this is not the derivative minus sign, derivative is this one, derivative is this one right
i need for input nand, i again pick up from the library, i put it in my design
supposing we do not want to stop at the first solution, but keep printing out it is actually much easier; then what we do is we just keep going through all possible positions and whenever we reach the final step if we actually a solution reaches the final step then we record it in our case it might print it otherwise we extend it and go to the next one
if i want to make two non inverting amplifier again two resistors and that is it
now, this is connected to this when at time t 1 ok
so we do this check over here in these few lines, what we do is that we first determine if the next chunk that is present in the adjacent chunk that is present has its in use bit set to 0, if so then we print some details about the link list that ptmalloc maintains
so, now you know let us consider what happens as current flows through a capacitor right
then student comprehending what needs to be noted this also might be an activity that could be difficult to execute
so and we are providing four sides welding right and overlapping is 70 mm
let’ us see in the next line, so if you have this particular function you can divide this the periodic function into three parts
so, for r thevenin that voltage source is short circuited right
so a tree with the hive bee flew in two lines
let us now go in to alternative tools and techniques this is the topic of discussion that we will be taking up today
so, we need to create at least 1 node and that is why we need to use this kind of representation in order to denote an empty list
so we've been examining these two cases earlier as well as a line failure or the tooth failure
whatever i am drawing as the rotor parameter again i am going to draw corresponding to forward side and backward side
but we should try to make it happen that losses in one market or less profit in one market should be made good from the other market
now, a gene might have a few hundred to over a million base pairs
the simplification that we will make is the following
today we will focus on this aspect of estimating the residual strength in particularly in compression and then we will also examine shear
the question we ask now is, is it that i always need the other charge to find the force or this is original charge distribution itself does something in the space
so, units for mobility can either use meter square per volt per second
it covers consultation, medicine and health equipment
minus of this term; that means, there here here it is shown that in here that it is not exactly this one it already coming this one, right
now we update in place list1, 2 to be equal to 4
once we know that join these points parallel to that, we have to go
so, there is a latch here; so from the data bus whenever you are outputting some data
i have just written down the whole i mean whole equation in discrete form if the left hand side is at time n minus half right hand side should also be at time n minus half
so today we will discuss the concept of root mean square voltage and current which is also called as effective voltage or current
another precaution which we have to take during our understanding of the proxemic behavior is that these cultural differences should never be turned into cultural stereotypes to look down upon any cultural norm
vt will keep falling further and further as i increase or as i draw more and more current from the generator
i should show the flux lines will be in this direction basically
now, next one is that your bewley lattice diagram, a bounce diagram
now, what we do is for every possible value from 0 to n minus 1 that is for j, for all column values we check if i j is free in the current board
at the end of this course, you are able to design the filter circuits, analog circuits using operational amplifier, using mosfet and so on
this we will see later this we will see later right
now, similarly for v 2 case , v 2 case we can write again chain rule v 2 is equal to n 2 d phi 1 2 upon d i1 into d i1 upon d t this actually it is actually mutual inductance
further, you can also look into the effect of these mineral admixtures, right
so, most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, it is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory and this decision you are about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want not just people saying i want to go fix it, but what are we going to do, but i think we have to do is invest in america so, he starts shifting his body right here you can see he is about to walk away
now recall that we have d dot, d, l integrated over the path is equal to mu naught, epsilon naught
so, it is open source and you know you do not have to pay money for, it is free right
these stereotypes are widely held not only by men, but also interestingly by women and both react towards others on the basis of these stereotypes
so, the analogous systems are described by the same differential or maybe integrodifferential equations or the transfer functions
all other factors are nominal
therefore, after the copier completes its execution
so, this is how we can measure the voltage, this is what we are measuring ac voltage
so you know, it is, it is difficult for people to understand this but there really is no alternative that can enable us to live in cities with motorways and everything like that as we do in the modern world
d s prime is r square sine theta prime, d theta prime, d phi prime
since a large portion of the d ram content is still available a lot of information present in the d ram can be retrieved by the attacker
how many times can i repeat this process
so, the concept of smith chart arises from this interesting phenomenon that we see in transmission lines
however, we find that there are still certain traditional pockets in certain societies and cultures where this is a still avoided
although delta f delta f remain same, but delta p g 2 and delta p g 1 there are same unless and until they are droop characteristic they are different unless and until they are ah speed droop characteristic is identical right; that means, this delta p g 2 will be different than delta p g 1 or or vice versa right
if you see the circuit carefully you will see that 5 ohm is now in parallel with the short circuit wire
03 and this is 50, so it will be 1
then you will get you will get p l max is equal to v thevenin square upon 4 r thevenin right, this is the this you can this you keep it in your mind that maximum power s equal to v thevenin square by 4 r thevenin right
d eq it will be 4
so, from that what we also understand that a particular frequency, the op amp cannot be operated, that is a maximum frequency at which the operational amplifier can be operated
further the first point is draw a 20 mm side
now you see it make sense when i talk about d r, which is the volume integral over the entire space, that it'll be non zero wherever curl of b is non zero and where are wherever a is non zero
in c++, we have a beautiful solution in terms of what is known as destructor
now, if there is there is a value then i can have value of r s and i can make value of rt
there is a wide range of choice of ide, so you can also use arm keil or gcc based ide’s including iar
so we are essentially looking at two components, one is like a static friction
in general, for any drawing sheets two methods are popular, one is called first angle projection system, the second one is third angle projection system
there is no back emf, only limiting factor for the current will be the resistances, nothing else
so it is not very complicated, you can again put this in a computer program and do and have all the choices made
you are doing it so fast that the flux linkage is really not able to follow the you know change in the position of anything it is not able to do anything basically
so, it is a slope it is this height, it is this height it is 12 right and this is from here to here it is 3
if you go by this theory depending on what the motor strength and the unit strengths are, you will get a disparity between the points of failure
now, if you can complete your routing means in this way, over the cell manner, then you do not need this separate channel at all
now, in the course of processing, if it is not completed, so it is not finished goods, neither it is raw material, then we will call it as a work in progress there will be also goods which are ready ready for dispatch but not yet sold so you will have stock of finished goods so these are the three major items of stock rm stock then wip stock and fg stock this is in case of a manufacturing for a trading concern, they may only have stock of finished goods
it means 1 should supply the power other should consume the power
i hope i am clear
this is where you are comparing moral education classes versus
hence its x component is going to be sine theta, cosine phi, as we saw in the previous slide
this study was published in two thousand and seven addressed this, addressed the issue of this shorter dormant period by adding citric acid, right
because it is a drawing course we are not going too many details into mathematical formulation of these curves ah, but just to have overall idea about what kind of curves are good for what kind of applications, that is the thing what we are going to learn about it
now, this we are illustrating with a diagram like this
so, earlier you have got less inventory, now you have got more inventory
so, this says create an empty dictionary; now for three of these things for queen, row and column right the indices are 0 to n minus 1
in spite of this what we want is a trusted execution environment would provide is an environment where you can run sensitive applications in spite of os being compromised
and i should also apply for the force by area out here
aluminum has basically higher resistivity if you compare the resistivity of the two materials copper will have better current density, higher current density it will be able to withstand
these are only linking with its own self, the primary only
so, if i give you incident field and the scattered field from that you can get total field right
now, this is symbolically giving the other person an upper hand and it suggests that you do not have any objections if the other person controls the situation, sometimes it is done deliberately when you have to offer in a apology and instead of using words you also want to communicate this idea with the help of your body language
you see, here the reason is there buffer, do not increase the fanout capacitance of upstream gates like here
see, xor, gate, pa is one, but pb is zero, or p a is zero and p b is one
so, this is my vab this is my v , because this is open this is open this is nothing is there
so, now we can write now, then p plus jq, so we also can write p plus jq is equal to root 3 v l i v l i l angle theta
let us look at them step by step
so initially you start with this r which covers the entire layout area, which means the moves are allowed anywhere within r
so if you look at the core data sheet there is a parameter called area product sometime it is given or ac and aw will be giving you multiply and then find out the area product so you can list down the area products and you can choose that area product which is higher than next higher than the calculated area product so you can use you can derive with those two equations for each of the transformer topologies and for the forward converter it is given in this form p0 is the output power 1 plus 1 by efficiency efficiency is assumed at around 80% divided by root 2 into kw into j into f s into bm so this is the area product for the forward converter
so, that is called the that is the low bit is there that is lsb and then after that the bits are transmitted
so, this is again i see metal can
now, we are measuring the output of the differentiator
66
do you get it
george simon ohm was the german physicist who developed the relationship between current and voltage for a resistor
so, this is these sort of the central idea of finite difference time domain replace derivatives by differences what kind of differences are there
in this photograph we find that a person is standing over the standard gap between the legs which are firmly planted on the floor
the other option is to keep the list sorted
to make this calculation a bit easier, this li can be further simplified i should write it approximately as 1 + phi r square xcr bar into xcr bar square + 4 upon 16 epsilon f square
you can also examine it from the viewpoint of the op amp and you will reach exactly the same conclusion
as such, a typical application does not use a function like clflush, such an instruction is typically used to achieve memory consistency and which is not typically needed by many applications
so, in the case of a p type semiconductor, you have the fermi level located below the intrinsic level
but now if you have bist feature in a chip, it is not necessarily to go to the a, t, e to test the chip
the priority sealing protocol overcame most of the problem of the basic inheritance protocol and the highest locker protocol
so, all that happens is, if i nest one namespace into another, the name of this nested namespace is qualified by the outer namespace
so, if this is the field coil and here is the armature and i am going to have the supply here, what i can do is to have many taps in the field coil
then go there look at these different views
geographical names cannot be a subject of trademark, but goods coming from a particular geographical territory can be protected by gi or geographical indication; which is another subject that we will be covering
that is the basic concept of a reference
so d w t by d t plus d by d t of e, electromagnetic is equal to integral s dot d s is seen to be satisfied
128 mega hertz, will get answer close to 1
can i possibly mesh so much
i mean, my original value of vs is 5
so, what i am saying is if i; this means, i have, once we, once i write this function; that means, that i can call int with int int, which basically is this overload
the advantage of nptel videos is that you can stop at any time
so is l a is now a stuck at zero, l b you take the last previous value and f stuck at one
next is shot noise is present in any conductor all right, shot noise is present in any conductors, so that is very important to remember
now also we know e b 1 is 500 volt
the second is analyse, where you find the root cause of their suffering, why is it that they are going through such an experience, is it something that what is the root cause, find out where is it that you can really help
so, with this governor ah transfer function we got, turbine got and this ah generator we got right
if it is likely to rain, ensure that the umbrellas in your bag, put it if it is not there, or leave it if it is already there
so, once again the direction of td or the sign of td will not depend on the sign or direction of the current and from the physical consideration, what can we say
basically you will have to cut it and as you see the picture on the bottom right you can see that you will have to slice the wall, you will have to cut it at the top at the bottom at the side and then extracted
so, the 1st point draw directrix ab and cc prime we have noted down, then mark f on cc prime
ok, let us now talk about the design flow
on the left you have the view of ordinary function
similarly, if we would like to have left sided front view in the isometric planes first draw a horizontal line
so, here the current that is flowing is ifsd or 10 milliampere ok
so, z is equal to given 410, that number of conductor that this current i l is given 41 ampere, flux is given 0
then we have computer haptics which is based on algorithms and software’s associated with generating and rendering the touch and feel of virtual objects
now this signal we have to apply to the inverting terminal
so, something like that is what i want
suppose you have a you have a source right suppose, you have a source its source may be renewable base whatever it is
but nevertheless this is a lossy method it is not going to really give you a good performance in terms of good amount of starting torque
so, to do this, we try to merge some nodes to reduce this longest path
so, tau, tau will be cancelled
so, another thing is the delta or pi network right
so, a lot of a priori information has been given to you the location of the objects the fact that they are homogeneous and the fact that there is nothing else that is the perfect example of a priori information
when we do that c point and c point coincides there, b point and our b point coincides there, so join by a line
let me call this as m1 this is l1, this is common 1 this is v1
i conclude this module by displaying this particular snippet in which paul ekman is analyzing an american actor kato kaelins micro expressions and he is analyzing how the expressions of disgust and his con are displayed by this actor
ohm’s law right this is your famous ohm’s law ok
to summarize what we have seen is that, if you want to interact with files we do it through file handles, which actually corresponds to the buffers that we use to interact between the memory and the file on the disk
so, the intrinsic career concentration, n i is nothing but n c n v exponential minus e g over 2 kt, which if you substitute the values give you an n i of 2
this frontal view can be above vertical plane thing or avp is frontal view also
this is a basic idea behind pipelining and almost all systems that we see today as an internal pipeline structure, because of an efficiency considerations, because of throughput increase, increase in throughput that you get by doing that
it's almost same base of asset, only 2% change that to fall mainly because of depreciation
(professor – student conversation starts) what will happen to the torque when the speed goes beyond the rated value
p&l items like sales or revenue from services are not to be shown in cash flow
so, in this case your , current is here it is i c this current is your i c right , this current is i c right the , wattmeter is placed here
so, this smaller the region is we say the op amp is better ok
role of pupils in eye contact is also important
bottom
now, flux is equal to a into b; a is the cross sectional area, and b is the flux density
now naturally as you can see that here the static data members are in the public visibility space, so as my application is changing it anyone can actually come and change these values by simply assigning a new value or changing on in terms of the incrementation or decrementation
then once you identify the critical portions, to carry out certain optimization on those
how many of the nonsense syllables were you able to recall
so, so here so this is your what you call that with respect to the rotor that is same direction the net speed of the rotor field as seen from the stator is it will remain as your ns right
so this is the direction of rotation let us say the speed is omega,ok
so, that is basically the ideal condition, because in practical scenario all electrical wires have their own resistance
i have a fedora 23 linux desktop
come on it is a shinkansen train
so, the small signal model so far as we know consists of just the gm
so here also we shall be looking up a couple of algorithms and finally, a brief look at steiner tree based approaches shall be ah discussed now
so generally, when we represent a ferromagnetic core, we represent this by two specific parameters in its equivalent circuit, one is the current is actually lagging behind by certain angle because of which, we call this particular ferromagnetic core to be acting like an inductance
and would persistently hold his or her own opinion despite having same and certain shortcomings in it
now, let us talk about a sensor called light dependent resistor that can sense light
you may have thought of a number of ways to help learners construct their own knowledge and make their own meaning
and the other internal things at back side of that that is not visible
so, now, let us look at the h tan, here is where the derivation differs a little bit from your high school derivation
this this circuit is something like a source free circuit, right
we are in the week 7 module 4
sample abcd parameters of some common circuits
similarly, for j j is equal to 3 m 1 is equal to 3, m 2 is equal to 4, put this thing and get this expression right in the expression that is same expression of s i m 2 you put this thing get this expression
so, it will go further, if v x is lower the final value will be smaller
it is understood as a sign of mutual respect because this is a commonly shared cultural belief; however, one cannot expect the same reaction in an american or a british society
now if you have 4 hydrogen atoms you will have 4 molecular orbitals you will have 4 lines here if we have 5 you will have 5 lines here
we found that gallium arsenide has the highest mobility, germanium is also higher than silicon, but the main term that really dominates the conductivity is n i, which is the career concentration and n i depends upon the band gap
so, this is e 1 and e 2 so, w prime is going to be what w prime in this segment e 1 e 2
now, great; so i just give you some small task without doing it myself ok
so, we have to consider 2 following cases when a current source exist only in one mesh; that is figure
now obviously, phi r must be the same as when the rotor was open circuited right even when the machine is loaded also this phi r will remain more or is constant right
if i wanted to use the theory of green’s function, i would calculate this g once and then use it for whatever f is given to me that is the idea of green’s function
this will be generally more costly or costlier
so, you have to live with it there is no other records
so, the effective mass depends upon the e versus k plots that we saw earlier
it is a loss making company i would say and even if it is a profit making company even then they have no place or existence or sustenance in the mobile telephone
so, at large x both go to 0
this you can go at 3 into 10 to the power of 6 ampere meter square and this at 0
so, it means we have now shown here 150,000 units are sold in the market
so, the first term is constant f of x naught, then i have a linear term and then i have quadratic term and so on right and it is a infinite summation
so if i apply one zero, then my pulled down network will be on
or, i can convert between other kinds of integral conversions float to double, double to float; all of that various kinds, various types of a pointers can be converted
ok, so this problem, as i said, is solved by considering one region at a time, in some particular order
anywhere it moves, it will remain parallel
if the total information is available we can calculate maximum five variances, right
so if you divide five m m with this um, five m m means what
i can write the max function in terms of a macro like this and if i do this for int double
so a is a square module, one by one, b is mean one by three, c is one by one, d is one by two, e is two by one
37 ampere, you please solve it everything i have written here for you, but you please solve it
so, i am going to have less value of te produced
so, when the junction is formed, we know that the fermi levels have to line up
the term b spline was coined by isaac jacob schoenberg and it is a short representation of saying basis spline
01, full load sleep is given that is 0
sometimes we see hump kind of shapes, curves circular radius curves that kind of thing we only represent because it is not a circle, it is just a hump and it has a radius
there is a disconnection here because of which this gate input is behaving as if it is at zero
x square plus y square is proportional to x square plus, not not proportional
and in case of global function or friend function certainly both the operands are explicitly mentioned
so, we will write 6 angle minus 10 ampere as a phaser representation of the given sinusoid
4 millawatts, whereas this source is generating 10 volts times 200 microamperors, 2 millawatts, assuming i1 is 0
so, this is going to be the power factor of the induction motor
hydrogen atom has one electron and it has one proton in the nucleus
so so i suggest that you can work, work this out and see whether this patterns are matching
you can also increase the duration for this
now, if you look at the point at which the transistor enters triode region, that is when vi equals 0
so that is all that i had on life cycle assessment i hope you have learn something and seen the need to go for such type of assessment for in turns of sustainability of concretes and cements and the same procedure can be applied to other construction materials also, thank you
now, when we say we have a desired current, of course when calculating i have it in my mind that it should be 200 microamperors
this is to detect whether the video extensometer ratings are as same as that of what we observe in axial extensometer, the second one is a gauge length of 200 mm where that is as per the standards of rilem for testing of textile reinforced concrete
canadian psychologist, tulving was the first to make the distinction between episodic memory and semantic memory
so, let us consider first a ct so, errors in a ct; current transformer
the basic things like how to sketch, how to make 3d objects, how to assemble made them is the most important thing for us
so it will becomes something like 10,000+ how much is the product of this, the product of this will be will be something like 8453088 right
so, it will become 0 to infinity now and you will only have the component to integrate is e to the power minus st dt
because, this is the length what we are going to see
so, because i am multiplying by prime coordinates, i can this is just once again i will write it
these are based not only on common perceptions, but they have also been supported by scientific researches
so, all position will actually typically have a uniform type, but this is not required by python and we can nest list
in another words instead of computing two lists and then combining them we can just directly do the following: for each i from 1 to the maximum of m and n, if i divides both m and n then we directly add i to the list of common factors
but, if you print address of b here, it is different from the address of a, or address of x
now let us see the implications of this
so, you will find that the limitations of that model or the assumptions which were unrealistic in that model are not existing here
we were being, say, given 1
so, that starts v thevenin is equal to 1; if you put s is equal to 1, then your what you call then then your starting torque is achieved for r 2 dash is equal to root over r thevenin square plus x thevenin plus x 2 dash square right that is your from equation 28 this is my equation 20, this is my equation 28 right
it is related to imperfection in semiconductor material and have heavy ion implants
it may sound like a paradox why would you need weak cement
i can extend that solution by saying a 0 match is b 0 and then whatever matches
the spandrels are the portions between the vertically aligned piers and minimum steel is prescribed for the spandrel regions
he added there were a one specific type of body language used by russians mostly men and by no other nations that is a soviet face miss
so, i will get a wave like solution, but that wave will have that that factor of e x or h x whatever in the exponent right
even when am telling with many things 1 or 2 places because, so, many things are there
so let's write this: no radiation in the moving frame
you have seed holder right to hold the seed crystal,you have seed, you have crystal neck, you have shoulder cone, you have single crystal silicon, you have thermal shield heater crucible susceptor crucible and silicon melt
so, that given two strings here we can write and expression for the first name and the last name which actually goes to this function and performance a concatenation
so, actually we learn a little bit only about motoring part breaking part or generating part, but it is given, but we will not we are not interested into that
and, then from this static characteristic you know that if these 2 are equal output can be 0 no problem
in this case we have to go for electron beam evaporator alright electron beam operator
so, silicon is the second most abundant element on earth
now what applies for total current
so, whenever you are using a software, you always go back check how a geometrical construction by hand drawing we have done, and how this software really works
so, gamma x or the reflection coefficient is simply the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave
we are adding here the factory cost or the works cost, that is $2,000000, 6,000 rupees
so we prepare both the statements and we know now that this cost sheet is ready with us
so, when you design the oscillator the transfer function of the oscillator can be given as hs is equal to ns divided by s square plus omega naught square, which can be represented as ns by s plus j omega naught into s minus j omega naught
so, 2 ohm right so and this is one henry inductor
and of course the last type of connection, i can have all 4 of them coming in parallel, right
so i have to essentially draw a parallel vector to this
so, expressions are defined in kind of a recursive form will say that every literal is an expression
so there is nothing to worry about it, it is free of cost which means we should resort to this first as much as possible and was just source is fully exhausted that will look for the look forward for the other sources of finance like the short term sources of the finance and ones that short term sources of finance is over then we should we go for the long term sources of the place to meet the short term requirements
so, you can develop a ratio say for example, i say c is to n is to say silicon is to say lithium is just put some number say, say 5 is to 1 is to you know 2 is to 0
rather than the kind of the main difference from classical programming is, in classical programming you would have for instance a function like say push define and it will have two parameters typically a stack and a value
so, generally i will have permanent magnet there
5 minus 300
i can write it as d x divided by squared root of z square plus r square minus two z r x
again in terms of functionality the power transformers will be functioning only when the corresponding generator is generating, let us say the generator has been shut down for some reason maybe for maintenance, maybe there is a fault, maybe some prime mover has gone crazy, something is wrong, so you are shutting the generator
when the switch is off, the pole is floating and the pole voltage is undefined
then, we broadly looked at where to look for inventions and we had also mentioned on the audit that you would do to determine whether an invention should be patented or not, what we call the patentability search and, finally, we had touched upon the role of ip centres
similarly for this quarter, the rent 16,500 which is 10% of above the 10,000 of the sales is 16,500 that will be due for this quarter but will be paid in the beginning of the first month of the next quarter
now, reflected values now reflection factor for voltage, we know the formula for voltage it will be z 2 minus z 1 upon z 1 plus z 2, this we have seen earlier
one second something like this and have
one are based on simulation base: simulated annealing, simulated evolution or genetic algorithm, force directed placement these also a very interesting method
so, the strategy now is to move this value to 11 and then fix things, right
especially i want to emphasise for this microstrip matching networks, please go through the example that i have shown and it is also given in the notes accompanying this module, please go through it to get a better grasp on it
the ip policy will start with a preamble, it will have objectives, it will have definitions clarifying; what is a copyright
the association of a particular smell with memory is always there
so, the base, the derived will have to satisfy everything that the base satisfies
2f and all what they mean
so, daily opportunity cost is how much that we have to calculate in the problem we have given that opportunity cost of the firm is how much 15% right
temples, gods
e 2
let say now, through timing analysis what i can find out, that in this circuit the maximum delay from the input to the output, d is, lets say, delta d
so, then again then this method is ok
now we need to find out the value of g12 and g22
so, no flux here i 1 is negative and maximum
i mean, see the only way to return is by copying the value back; because at this point, the function funct which was executing is terminated; will get terminated after giving you the value
the position 0 represents a root then in order 1 and 2 represent the children, then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 nodes are the next level and so on
then we look at this plots we will understand with temperature from minus 20 to 60 how the input resistance will change
this m minus one, remaining vertices to v, i
these are three it is a three parameter model
so, reading is on the way to gain more and more knowledge
so i am taking about the time may be this is corresponding to let us say time t equal to t1 may be this is t1
so, having done this we have identified that factors of 14 and these factors are precisely the 1, 2, 7 and 14
5 line: this is x equal to 1 line, this is x equal to 1 line
to reduce error, we have to make no load current small and to make no load current small, we have to have high permeability material and low core loss; that means, we have to make x m and r 0 very high
so, we said also that the core is not ideal due to which we do have some core loss component of resistance, this is a fictitious resistance, not really the core resistance as such
so, it is it is as accurate as anything right for this small system
for that purpose what we require is we require an object perhaps it can be camera, it can be a pen, it can be pencil, or it can be a car also
so once you have this grid, from the grid you can take the clock points or tapping points to anywhere in the chip you want
this time let us just keep it as a fraction
so, the solution is put r diode in this circuit just like the voltmeter circuit we used previously and then the current will flow for half of the time and the meter can indicate some non zero value
so now while evaluating the constraint for c1, we assume that c2 and c3 are short circuits, and so on
so this flows from armature to the power supply, am i right
but i don't think that they'll be able to compete with these three multinational giants
sometime what happens that we look forward that in the next one week or next 15 days or for next 1 month
it is neither z 1 1 nor z 1 2
but the fact is that, they have chosen incidentally the same function name and independently developed it together
so how do i achieve 7
let us think of the other intelligent options
so now again you can keep on ticking it, we have taken direct material, direct wages, direct expenses, wages of the 4 man, electric power lighting
remember if the next node is none, itõs next must also be none
42 meters whereas the estimate in the other case wall b since it is additive we use the higher eccentricity and therefore h into 1
11 this is for 120 and this is for 130 so for 124
so i am going to calculate for path three where e x is going to be e x, x, y plus partial e x over partial y delta y
because of this the h s will be unstable, so the first requirement is that this for system for be stable the n s should be less than the degree of n s should be less than the degree of d s
there should have been a loss, maybe there was the expected loss was how much 24,000 units but actual loss is 30,000 units means our loss has increased by 6,000 units
now, let us take one example and we will see how the knowledge which we have just gathered related to electrical circuit how we can transform it into the model of the electrical circuit
there is the way one quadrant of this ellipse can be constructed once it is done, same procedure we have to repeat it from c all the way to b f line something like dividing into 1, 2, 3, 4 draw a line which goes c via 1
so, you will get q is equal to 31
now, we want to use this to find out, what is the reflected field
in the previous class i discussed with you that how to prepare the cost sheet
so matching is a concept that comes from graphs theory
so, these are to be overloaded by really expert people and till you get to that level, i would advice that you please do not overload that
now you have purchased on credit credit and whatever is the requirement of the january
so, everywhere you can if you move like this
so, the plate will always try to eliminate the relative motion between the magnet and the plate
so, here the output is negative
so, having gone back from the 8th square and, so 8th row which is completely blocked, to the 7th row which had only one choice, to the 6th row which had only one choice we come back to the 5th row and now we try the next choice for the 5th row
so, this is lattice diagram now
op amps itself has a huge circuit made up of mosfets and we will see that
so you people we will say zero, point, zero, zero
at the same time is somebody is interested, then the neck maybe exposed, the head may be tilted the eyebrows may be raised there may be a little smile and often you would find that this is understood as a courtship signal also
so, what is it input offset current the difference in magnitudes of i b 1 and i b 2 is called input offset current; so, easy right
as of now, he is looking in that direction, whatever the shape he is observing that let us call front view, this one is the front view projection
the current does increase slightly with increasing vds
so, this will be time and at different times i will plot this strength of this magnetic field and say time
now what type of formation should cause expansion
so, just clean it right hope things you have understood that how to make this thing right
but at least one way to scientifically study it, is to build a, let us say, a model of human tissue
they are well protected as actual parameters
so, very simply this just becomes jk by 4 h 1 2 k rho and this is the usual notation a different script for where r is ok
so, this is the value of e g, which is the band gap of the material
similarly, a point and a point coincides there, connect that
we develop the wafer in a su 8 developer
one reason is that it has become unfavorable because at the we planned at the 9,000 actually 7,000 but and that is why the contribution margin has seriously declined by 24,070 which is unfavorable but that had to be because you are expecting 7,000 units to sell in the market
it maybe visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area
that is the basic power of the class template and this gives us lot of generalization in terms of the data structures in particular and different utility classes
and if it is, if it is achieved, then we can say that there will be no clock skew
so, ready with the solution
however, in this case, we will examine what that limiting value of the gap must be but let's assume if we have this sort of situation the wall must actually rotate and after rotating a certain finite rotation it will come into contact at the top point
a fillet surface is a rounded corner, connecting the edges of two other surfaces
sometimes lasting more than even a couple seconds
finally, you look at this third output which will come from main, after the function has returned
so this sum of the delays of these shorter segments will be much less then the delay of this long segment if you have a single segment
adults thing is a rigid, more you more you grow, you more rigid you become
so, does that contrast with something that you have learnt from like class 9
so one of the ways you know if we go to the slides on the monitor is a method called òpower combiningó
management accounting is not at all a discipline in itself
so, in today’s session we will discuss about the second order response of the circuit means those circuits which contain inductor, capacitor and resistor; all 3 components are there or we have 2 inductors or 2 capacitors which cannot be clubbed to become a equivalent inductor or capacitor
because, when t tends to infinity, if you look into that, when t tends to infinity, the circuit reaches to steady state
okay, you wouldn’t mind sharing it
assume the equation of a parabola
now if we consider a closed path, then in this closed path current will flow like this ok
so we saw that in the previous module we had seen that for 2 special cases, 2 special properties of networks 1 is the reciprocity and the other is the lostlessness, we can derive some special conditions for the, that the s parameters of such networks should [sa] should [sat] satisfy
so, this is your what you call i 2 is equal to i 1, we have got your 1 by 22 ampere
so, as you can see, as you go up and up, you get a structure where the terminals are very regularly spread all across the chip
so, now this is your this is r 1 this is your r 1, this is r 2 and this is r 3 right
so, for example, this “df” could represent a differential or a small amount of work done and i want to find out the total work done so, i have to integrate along the path
we should have resistances everywhere, then we will eliminate some of them later
so in this case for calculating the labor mixed variance under the three different categories of the workers and then summing it up and calculating the composite gang composition various, i will discuss with you in the next class
so, writing this expression like this you do not get much intuition of what is it actually look like
this amount is 16,000 dollars we are going to pay so one payment we are making of 2 lakh 40,000 dollars another payment we are making is of the 80,000 another payment we are making is of the 16,000 dollars anything we have to pay for the fixtures no we have not to pay anything for the fixtures now so fixtures is fixed expenses yes now the fixed expensive we have to pay which is fixed all the times
5 because counter is always incremented by a factor of 1; by a count of 1 and say it is incremented at every positive cycle or negative cycle
block diagram wise this is how a successive approximation a/d converter looks like
stator is also supplying the rotor current
so, it will be r, thus at the resonance impedance z is minimum
so we have to to check that as well
now, this concept of conservatism is very important and it is at a root of several accounting treatments
phi 1 is magnetic flux emanating from coil 1 and phi 1 1 1 component of phi 1 links coil 1 i told you and phi 1 to another component of phi 1 links both coil 1 and coil 2 that i has told you
vgs must reduce
so, we have to calculate the c here again, again the order size is how much 10,000*that is 1+0
so, v p by 2 is equal to v l by 2
the distance from the fermi level to the vacuum level, the top most is the vacuum level, is the work function i am going to call phi of platinum and platinum has a work function of 5
so, after looking at the comparison with lossy media we find out that the interpretation of s z can be taken from that of a lossy media it is as though
so, question is that if you look path a b e f a; that means, a b e f a; that means, this one a b e f a, right, this one, right
one should not construct something like that any view there should be a gap
ssimilarly, in this case what would be the open circuit voltage, open circuit voltage would be is into r now as per property if you see that both of the circuits are equivalent, your v o c for first circuit or voc for second circuit should be equal
this will be your per phase current
be very clear, wage is a direct expense whereas the salary is the indirect expense right then we have the direct expenses so it means it is a other direct expenses means other direct overheads so we have material we have wages and we have the other direct expenses so in this case if you want to prepare the cost sheet and calculate the first component of the cost of the total cost that is a prime cost
the time should be given, multiple sources of information should be collected and one most important thing is one should always whether it is a school setup or a psychological setup or even as in your relatives and all you should see whether the kid is having problem throughout or, the kid was normal at whatever age and suddenly something has happened
to see this engine in motion, solidworks also features this simulation
sitaram, can you please press channel one
now, if you are directly connecting the clock with the gate input, so the input as well as the output will be changing at every edge of the clock
the alternative solution is reciprocal counting which we have discussed before; which is similar to measurement of frequency; sorry measurement of time period instead of frequency ok
code cannot be present in that segment because it is not an executable segment
till then you take care read thisese things, learn, understand and look at the videos,
because this is one coordinate
various researchers have tried to define the fields associated with kinesics, fields which come under its purview in different ways
this, by divergence theorem, is integral d dot d s, which is equal to rho free d v, which is the total charge q
hm, today we start by looking at a variation of the virtual grid based compaction
so, this is also satisfied, right, y22 is 0 because you see that this expression does not contain vds
and the next variance i will talk to you is about the next slide if you look at this is the flexible budget variances but these are the variances you would see here it is called as the activity level variances so in the previous slide what is this variance is called as flexible budget variance and this is a variance between flexible budget and the actual results
07 i have approximated this one as 7
so, there will be in into line capacitance c 12 and there will be capacitance between the top metal and the bottom metal which is represented by c 11
it is 1 by 2 pi under root of lc right where l is in henry and c is in l is in henry and c is in ffarad
so this gives me l cubed
but you can still use the c style of post casting to cast between the different pointers of these types
so, same thing upon simplification this, we are writing w ke 0, w ke 0 is equal to h into p r we have seen
so let me just refresh your memories
so, that supposed to be at 30 degrees angle is supposed to make
so let's see what is this software crisis, what causes it and how to overcome
so she actually took a hacksaw, mild small hacksaw like this and cut the neck of the bottle to open the medicine bottle to get her medicines out
this is ground by the way, this point is grounded
they are not going to come again and again
so you can see in this graph that he of from the first micro processor that came to the market, it is here four, zero, zero, four, up to the latest sandy i v micro processor, multi code systems, which intel is coming up with
so we go back to the terminal and let me do the net list
it is as against the expected level of the $160,000 it has come down to $158,000
now, go to front plane, let us construct a line beginning with 0, a branching junction we would like to construct
then, when i explore 0 0, i get this neighbor at the bottom which is 2 1
now the first item, share capital
similarly, in new also the construction is implicit
so initially there are few blocks
again, i repeat that in today's competitive scenario, if you want to maximize the profits of the company or you want to keep the profit of company intact, so what you will have to do
if our voice has low speed and low pitch it shows our depression high pitch is normally associated with enthusiasm and eagerness, high pitch but a long drawn out way of speaking suggest our disbelief, accenting tone suggest astonishment and abrupt speech also shows our defensive attitude
now, an alternating supply voltage it is a v1 is given right
surface deterioration, loss of cementitious structure or sometimes delamination can actually happen in the systems on the field and generally it is coupled with physical science of damage from salt crystallization
then we discussed about active and passive circuit elements
now, what is positive photoresist
you make three boxes
no, we are not putting the source and observation on the same line, we have always separated by a; now
then you might ask why are we directly going to bandpass or bandstop, from traditional filter theory, we should 1st discussed about lowpass and high pass filters
so, this side is time, it is time t it is given here, this is time
1, and j 0
so, in this case your what we call that source is delta, but load is star
it means that the total phase change over this entire feedback path should be zero or 360 degree and the total gain starting from this point all the way to through the other end then back should be 1
now here before anything we do we have to understand little bit
forward converter transformer specs like the primary va, secondary va, it has chosen a port code 26 bar 16
so, when we have to find out the equivalent resistance we can utilize over knowledge of thevenins theorem and simplify the circuit to find out the equivalent resistance second when we have the dependent voltage source, we can also use the simply kirchhoff voltage law and simplify the circuit as we do in case of mesh analysis so, whatever the approach we will take the value will remain same but, it is always better to obtain first the inductor current
so, you have to find out all these right
same way the output impedance for ideal op amp would be 0, but if you see in the practical operation amplifier, this operation amplifier, then you will see that the output op amp is not 0, but close to 0, alright
in this lecture, i will be discussing about two communication protocols, one is gsm and another is bluetooth
a 20 kva… a 20 kva
so this fast clock violates setup and hold times of various gates in this aes circuit resulting in a faulty output
86 right ymax i can find out so once we find out ymax that means if the neutral axis is following in this way then ymax i can find out this is the bolts are there 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 so this is how so this is the ymax and maximum bolt force due to tension will be develop in the extreme one in extreme bolt the extreme top most bolt will be developing the maximum tensile force tmax so we can calculate the tmax value so tmax will become m into ymax by summation of yi square so if i put this value m was 50000 kilonewton meter and ymax was we have calculated 312
we thankfully even went to the indian construct, the indian concept of personality the trigunas
if you see this figure where current source is there, voltage source is also there so at first instant you see that this is a little bit complicated circuit and difficult to solve but actually it is much easier than what we discussed till now, how
so, let say that i have some point over here, let us call this the origin and i am trying to plot a vector field like this
now the question is so, when we talk about the clock signal, so what should be the time period when the here a few things
keep in mind that cost accounting is primarily targeted to internal users
again 7 times that i will get 14 equations in 14 variables
now this is going to be coupled to a synchronous machine which is having the rotor
that is what i would say as xm
now when we look at discrete methods, discrete means that we have to make a sample and then at individual times we have to stop the hydration and do the complete analysis
so, setting the field to be 0 on the boundary is not the correct boundary condition
so, rather than doing that, if i can do something like create you know such kind of condition which will be equivalent to loading it fully without actually loading it
so, wire mesh is placed in the plaster and then this can be a steel or a plastic wire mesh with a lot of these geogrids available today it is possible to have a rather thin joint
so, that way no touching is satisfied whereas still the measurements are perfect because you’ve trained one of the ladies to actually do the measurements for you
now, we have been given a few raw transactions and directly from raw transaction we should make balance sheet on respective date on each date
are the other ones alright
so, let us measure 50 mm to locate d lines, so this is 50 mm
1, gm also increases by 10%
so you now take it as the because this is the positive balance so this will come this side by gross profit gp and this is how much 6 lakhs
amazingly easy, isn’t it
this was not there in the 1958 act and this was again in compliance of the obligations under the world trade organization
and its projection, as a triangle
but i would make a general case for is that if it is all possible, let us test the real material because until we do that, we will not pick all the effects, in particular the effects of the aggregates
so, total complex power, it will be three phase right
signals in the sense, that when you talk about ac signal, it is generally sine wave,
in case of a two port network, the equivalent is a linear two port
similarly, sio2 which is glass has band gap of approximately 10 electron volts
in c++, two functions or more than two functions can have the same name
after that, t f f plus t max d two will change after that
whatever the current which is flowing inside the terminal a b divided the voltage which you are applying then v naught divided by i naught would be giving you the value of thevenin equvalent resistance that is rth
supposing, we add 33 now to the heap that we just created
now basically the behavioral theories are based on the premise that learning takes place as the result of observable responses to any external stimuli and therefore, it is also known as stimulus response theory
if people are having trouble somewhere, you make sure that it is solved, it is resolved there itself
secondly, it requires a writable code segment, which could essentially pose problems
now, what is the significance of state transition matrix
that exercise we will continue doing till the end
but you know that at any point of time only one kind of data packet will come, only one data packet will come then how do you define a programming structure to store this data packet
so, i am just using some wavy notation that this is where the derived class d is derived through a protected manner
12 right; therefore, like your parallel resistance impedance i have the same thing we do not know 1 upon r is equal to 1 upon r 1 plus 1 upon r 2
curl of the first equation
now, if i would like to reopen that, open that
so, what you get finally that is s to the power ny is nothing but r minus an s minus s to the power n minus y minus an minus 1 s to the power n minus 2y and so on up to minus a2sy minus a1y, so this particular figure represents the differential equation which we just written
you can say it seems that the real part i mean the resistance is around 75 to 80 ohms, this reactance i do not know right it's sometime i mean both the results both the methods are giving slightly different results not slightly different results
so, if we substitute the values what will i have, 6 kilo ohm, i have value of 6 kilo ohm
first one, second one and so on all the way to eighth one name it like a, a1, a2 and so on all the way to a7
the camera system that we discuss caught something which it did not know earlier
how do we choose these basis functions
so, you can access individual bits as we know that the memory has got a word size
similarly, in this case also if we have 2 capacitors but cannot be clubbed to represent as a single equivalent capacitor of the circuit
and similarly if you start with a vb that is equal to vs, what you will get here will be something smaller than vs
let us try to understand what is capacitor
so, that means that if the network is connected in cascaded fashion, the abcd parameter of overall network can be v multiplication of individual abcd parameters of the sub networks
so, supply side has improved
so now what you had to do was to analyze using 5 why’s and the conflict of interest, once you have that then we can jump into the solved stage
so this will be used time and again in all your magnetic circuit calculations
the inductive definition says that 0th fibonacci number is 0; the first fibonacci number is 1; and after that for two onwards, the nth fibonacci number is obtained by sub adding the previous two
along that dimension we can just move our mouse, then again give left click
so, strength estimates from non destructive testing is a red flag
let me tell you about iot and embedded system, i have already told you the relation between the two
what will happen is some current will be collected here directly from commutator segment 2 which means coil b and coil c junction is actually pushing some current into the commutator segment 2 which is actually being pushed into the brush
so now you have you know this, let us see in the next module how you can implement it, and let us get the values at the input signal and output signal
if at bc from the input to the output it will be one shorted line, so the input reflection coefficient at bc will simply be rl z0 upon rl+z0
so, if we see first thing is cv, then we have fb,
this will be two
so how does an l f s r look like
mars pathfinder landed on the mars surface on 4th july 1997
i think the standard itself is actually in need of improving, in my opinion
now, we want to really mate these surfaces
you come up with that
so, you can to control at the bit level may be one bit is configured as input, other bit configure as output; so, that is possible
this is the top view in third quadrant projection
7 into 2 that is 1
so, an independent current source, when it is independent current source again it is a two terminal elements, it is a two terminal element that provides a specified current right your, what you call completely independent of the voltage across the source
so, somewhere there join this line in that locate 40 mm line
so critical points would be only axial force capacity, no moment capacity, then the balance section, and then finally you have only moment capacity, no axial force capacity, and the four zones in between
so, this is actually i, and this is n turns, and this is the only thing need to understand the direction of the flux path
sometimes we find that verbally a person may contradict it, a person may say oh, i understand very well your situation, using the neck scratch, but then we can easily understand that the person is not truthful in this statement
you can see again it is a heat sink, right
this is called as a zero debt company
the next thing we do is we craft different addresses, note that we require 4 sets of addresses, each is a collection of 8 different addresses
so by using the list address bit i can select either this or this
so we can find out the equivalent impedance of this particular parallel combination
generally we consider number of bolts as 2 in general
i am sorry, the routing key is specified here as a routing key is equal to underscore routing key, which means binding key, which will come as an argument while we type, will be taken and that will be given to the routing key
so when we talk about clock tree synthesis, so it is performed in two steps
so, i have written down maxwell’s equations in vacuum and vacuum which has no sources or charges, no sources means rho is 0, no and charges also 0 and current is also 0 right
when we understand mosfets, we understand op amps
one is the variable cost and second is the fixed cost
so, we will make this to be
primed
so, we will just look at some of the principles which will help us to take a informed decision about that
what is the problem
we will applied input signal to the to the inverting terminal, and the non inverting terminal would be grounded, why
here new here td is this schedule the time to delivery or the o, which means what originally you have planned to develop the vat software
so, it is 5 plus 10 is equal to 15 ohm
if you see here the current source and the resistances are in parallel so you can use nodal analysis in this case
so, let us measure 19 mm on the sheet
this is a different constant
so, the inverse scattering problem now back to our favorite equation right
so, at this concentration and at higher values of concentration your donor atoms are essentially too close, so that the atomic levels mingle and we have a donor band
so, now you know that frequency stability is very important when we talk about the oscillators, and that particularly crystals
so first let's look at the operating point of this particular circuit
so, what is the monthly sales
so, it is given 4500 by 15
so if want actually how to calculate this power in the complex form let me call this as p, let me call this as q and ultimately what i want is p plus jq, this is what i want
these all have their origin from the language c and the statement called printf in c, so the exact format statements in our 0, 3d and 6
so, the infinite gain would be useless except in the self regulated negative feedback
this i am connecting to a circuit, let us say a bulb to the ac mains
so creating an arbiter puf would require that we provide a challenge and correspondingly determine whether the output is 0 and 1
in such scenario, that item of stock we will record at 9,000
at an early stage of their development, the communication theories which tend to address cmc by and large looked at the negative aspects of a communication event, which is occurring without traditional nonverbal cues
so, differentiator, what is a differentiator
you will have to update the the e y value yeah
so in that case what will happen you have to use current division at this particular note you will get the value of current flowing through 4 ohm resistor that is nothing but 2 ampere
epsilon is equal to
please note at this point, that the operator functions are implicit for all predefined operators of built in types
so i am going to give excitation in both the cases
so, first term on the left hand side any problem
so this expression will repeat itself after every one, after every beta value, after every lambda dash value, given by two pi upon beta
d r means whatever is coming on this line, this where chip two, chip two will be capturing it in the first flip flop
if something like a’, b’, c’, d’, if we are showing it indicates that front view
now, next the time periodicity, we discuss that if the function can be given by a periodic the periodic, series like f1 t plus f1 t minutes t that means time shifted by time constant t multiplied by unit step and so on
if the closing stock value is high, the profit, the gross profit will be high
that means, i 2 dash upon i 2 is equal to n 2 upon n 1, right or i 2 upon i 2 dash is equal to n 1 upon n 2, right
so, you can see that there is a swirl happening over here right
let's see if this makes sense again in this y which is carrying current i and outside that that it is coming back the flux per unit length will be in this area which i am showing by this shaded region, and this is going to be times b r, times per unit length
so we will have to decode what that code means, to identify what or which sub system is not working correctly
daters are very low 8, 5, 6, 10 and 16
so, consider the value: gcd of m n assuming that m is greater than n
so, if i have p a, which is a pointer to a type, it is a pointer to a type
so, there will be no effect for this one it is completely isolated right nothing is there and thing is this 5 ohm and your this they it is short circuit; that means, this 5 ohm actually has no value right
so, this is connected to minus 12 this is connected to plus 12 this center point can be grounded and this is the reference 0
so, the coefficients in the pulse basis for the electric field i am calling v fine let us just change it from small a
so, what it is returning is a copy of x; which is in a temporary, and i have hold that temporary
so, i 3 is equal to here to write here i 3 is equal to v 2 minus v 3 by 10
i will show you the answer but of course it will be a better learning experience if you do it by yourself
what is embodied energy
they did it with some of my questions i asked in between, so that helped them structure their thinking as well
then long term borrowings are negligible
so, when this ti interrupt occurs; so, then; that means, some transmission has taken place and when this ri interrupt occurs then this ri interrupts receive interrupt has taken place
this is like i am having a very simple processor in this rapper where i am serially feeding in an instruction
now in this context, i would point you to an example that we had taken here earlier which had shown the same thing
our understanding of time helps us to organize our nonverbal communication in a better way and to modulate our dialogue and conversations in such a way that the other people can also empathetically understand it
so, if it is so, then v is equal to whatever i wrote, v is equal to we will get minus 80 volt right minus 80 volt
so, for doing it; so, what we need to do is first write a 1 to the pin; so first we write a 1 to this pin
so if both voltage and current are in phase that means that the circuit is purely resistive
so i will take another problem, this time a more serious problem to illustrate how these 5 whys work
so, let us say normal incidence simple case reflection coefficient is n minus 1 by n plus 1 this is n right
so, your question is that is this boundary condition dependent on the boundary location
now, whatever the dimensions we are interested in 75 units mm, then click ok
rand t, no; r and t i just telling us the equation that true at some point in space and time
so, from here it will go on decreasing and then it will reach here, what you can see here on the left side, what i have drawn you see right it looks like it is approaching 0, and that is why i d would be i d saturation
recall that the potential energy in the case of electric field was the work required to more a unit charge in that electric field
ripple move means we do some kind of a rippling or chain reaction like: you place the cell p in the location that has been computed which is occupied by q, and for q, with the new location of p, you compute the new zero force location for q
so, we look and we find that it is not
v b c means b positive 1st one is positive, 2nd one is negative right, this instantaneous polarity
in fact, notice that rather than going to the maximum of m and n we should go to the minimum of m and n, because once we cross the smaller number we will not get a factor for the smaller number
we get omega is equal to 2 pi f
so, this figure 20 shows the relationship graphically for an inductor whose inductance is independent of the current
in 1d, it looks very simple
all he did, he attached the galvanic anodes, the zinc anodes and what he saw was the zinc was corroding away but the steel was not corroding
so, here we would just try to give you a basic idea that how to resolve the overloaded functions
we have seen in this particular module how the silicon boules are manufactured and a clean room that is required
so, a series motor having a resistance of 1 ohm between it is terminal drives a fan for which the torque actually is proportional to the square of the speed; that means, t proportional to n square right at 230 volt, it runs at 300 rpm and takes 15 ampere, the speed of the fan is to be raised to 375 rpm sorry, by increasing the voltage, find the voltage and the current required, this is the problem right
and then the total number of units which are shifted from the previous period to the current period
ok, so simulated annealing: i mentioned this, that this is a process which simulates the annealing process in metals or glass
it is open right, but input what we have done is we have connected a voltage source v 0 is equal to 1 volt 1 2 3 4
so base impedance if i try to look at it, z base for primary will be 220 divided by 10 which is 22 ohms, whereas if i try to define z base for the secondary that would be 110 divided by 20, which is actually 5
several of those accounting policies are based on the concept of conservatism
let us now try to downcast
so we are talking of the ith bit
now, if we are looking from top view, it looks like a triangle and if we are looking from a front view because one of the edge is parallel
having perceived things we learn certain things, there are certain guiding principles, we are biological creatures, there are some certain bio cultural factors, certain things which we passively learn, certain things that we actively engage our self and then we learned
day fifty, somewhere around this forty to fifty, he started to evaluate their electrical activity and what you observe is most of the neurons at this stage are shooting multiple, double, single action potentials
so, we see this is how we are learning about how we can use op amp for several applications
i have not really mentioned about any movement so far because i have not really sufficiently pumped in you know enough amount of current
if we analyze the priority sealing protocol, we will see that it prevents deadlocks, prevents chain blocking, prevents unbounded priority inversion, and also limits the inheritance related inversion
whatever the intersection point let us call p 2, p 2 dash or p 2 prime in such a way that a to 1 distance plus b to 1 distance always gives us major axis 70 mm
the first one is independent of the design, so the cost of the first step can be shared by this five customers
so, this circuit seems better good, but there is a problem
so i have solved this problem of a hard spherical magnet, what the field should be inside if it has magnetization m, also height here
so, example 20 obtain the current in 2 ohm resistor of the circuit shown in figure 51, use thevenin’s theorem also super position also you will use to get the thevenin voltage
another aspect is what happens when you start the simulation right
that term was cos of theta v minus theta i
i also experienced once or twice in this thing that when the video recording; i do not like to tell that and only what incident is very funny that i was coming by car
supposing i do a measurement in this room i am trying to measure the radiation pattern of an antenna, but without realizing something is hit the roof and come back and my measurement is corrupted by these reflection i want to cut it out
so if theta is equal to theta prime, it means this cantilever is not moving or at that particular instant it was at the baseline
so, say if this block is representing x1s so 1 by s you can put in both of the cases
sir basically that we have not part segment
now, to end we have also would introduce an overloading in terms of the friend operator function for out putting the information about this particular landline phone objects
in te waves which are also known as transverse electric waves, we have no component of the magnetic field along sorry we have no component of the electric field along the direction of propagation but the component of magnetic field along the direction of propagation will be nonzero
so delta will give you the loop gains related to individual loop gains as well as the non touching loop gains when you take two at a time or three or four and so on at time
so this i test, it consists of only this current
now if you take the laplace of function f1 so f1s you can simply write as zero to infinity f1 lambda e to the power minus s lambda d lambda
so, i have a created two instances and we have two pointers p b and p d both of the base class type
they help you a lot, in terms of understanding the complex nature of the individual whom you are trying to induct in your force and therefore this is a making become ccr
along with resources, you will need the providers for resources because resources cannot come for free
so, this is also bit of a art choosing which basis function depending on the problem
2 into 50 micro second right wave, it is determined by test made using impulses of 1
here we are looking at the circuit description at the layout level
resistors, capacitors and then your ics everything mounted on single printed circuit board, how it is how it is connected is connected using a process called soldering
you can see here in p&l, the taxes provided was 6,000
for fly ash which is very commonly used lot of our cement and concrete in india is made out of fly ash
now we shall see the basic principle of gate array, the way it works, the way it is created
so, modulus of elasticity is coming 10577
so a critical section is a section of the code in which some non preemptible resource is accessed that is read and written
so if you see this particular value is coming from particular ac source means, suppose if you take a particular element, say let’s take the resistor and it is connected to one ac source and one dc source with this which, so you can toggle that switch between ac and dc, so first if you’re connecting to ac source that means the switch is at this side means in that case what would be the average power
on the basis of listening to the other people’s voice, we can easily make out not only the emotions and feelings of the other person, we can also understand certain other aspects of that individual’s personality
so you will see things changing and then you can keep experimenting with it and then go back to the simulation, plug in the values and see what are the values that you would get
you have two examples here
of course you need an estimate of the wind force and you need an estimate of the gravity forces acting here
next what we will do we will further reposition this bjt or a transistor in the following way
now energy second thing is that energy is being stored in the capacitor whenever the power is positive; that means, when power is positive that energy is being stored
now, as i said, we need to establish differential equations that are different for the two cracked and uncracked segments of the wall itself
now, the one of the main issues in c, in terms of using arrays that you all must have faced is when i want to use an array in c, i need to know; i need to specify the size of the array which means at the maximum number of elements that the array can contain beforehand, that is at the time of writing the program or to be specific at the time of compiling the program
then the discussion on the push pull will be more complete
so, s 2 is closed this means s 1 and s 2 are closed forever right
so once you get a hamiltionian path, you have one way of routing the power or the ground lines
functions which rely on themselves
so, the simplest model is actually something that you have seen you have heard of drude model
articulation and reflection make learners tacit knowledge explicit by requiring them to express their ideas, their actions by requiring them to give reasons for the decision
so, this is a gap implementation, this capacitance does not actually exist, this is just i have shown as a symbol, this is a capacitance between the 2
so, sadness i think it is a lot of this illnesses have been a productive mechanism
so, if you do not give initialization then it is uninitialized variable which will have an unknown value to start with
so, what is the total output
so, i can write all the constants out j k by 4 integral, now what should i write, what can i will write the limits of integration as pi to 0 as we did in the simple example pi to 0 and what is h 1 2 k rho and what else
see now your work is very simple because we have separated credit balances and debit balances
but ok; so let me change this example a bit to make it more clear let me say that this is the true frequency 10
please note that just like how a current cannot flow in an open circuit; this is also always a closed path
supposing so, i am going to remove the vector sign it is understood from now by now
now the construction of a magic tee is something like this
when i take curl of a, it gives me mu zero over four pi
so that means it has to necessarily pass through air
it could have been entered the previous day, previous hour or may be several years back
so, i cut rab means, this rab right
, tthen probably i am sure that in a lot of people would be not be able what would not be able to answer it
ok, so something like this
is the certain amount of restlessness, apprehension, certain agitation, certain
so, being good being pure devoted tolerant having a state of mental equilibrium mental control intelligence knowledge and determination rajasic guna the root meaning is to be dyed
now go to asset side
hm
so, in case this is not clear, this is k tz and this is the part that is telling me that the reflected wave is travelling in the opposite direction as the incident wave right
so, this s equal to r equal to 0 that is not also possible, but this is a valid state ok
in that conic sections, in the last class, we have stopped at the cycloid curve
here also if we make rd very, very large, then rd parallel rl will be approximately equal to rl and we get the same gain as before
this is approximate one, this is approximate one why that everywhere you are taking the voltage is 240 volt right this is approximate one that every node voltage is actually 240 volt
we have studied just from characteristics of op amp, just input offset voltage, input bias current, very simple right and then we move to little bit complex circuits and here you see that we have reached to the circuits where you can really use the circuit in some actual electronic module
indian institutions have about 12 percent, foreign institutional investors, 18 percent
so, this is vds, vds is 3 volts, it should be greater than vgs which is also 3 volts, minus vt which is 1 volt
you see, i have mentioned the lot of things
so, this said, becomes a stuck at one and f stuck at zero
so, during the course we will be evaluating and analysing a lot of different programs
so, you substitute all these value i infinity i 0 and tau, you will get i t is equal to 3 plus 1 minus 3 e to the power minus 2 t or you can simply write 3 minus 2 into e to the power minus 2 t ampere right
so this is the contribution due to time, varying electric field
this allows us to write a very simple definition of prime based on factors which we have already seen
actually, it just looks complicated, the operation is really simple, right
so, turn avoid that intuitive navigation we have already spoken about that graphics, we have spoken about that text and also navigation, do not have forced navigation
it is significant for us to keep the sanctity of the intimate space because the presence of other people within this space may be overwhelming
so, if i see the characteristics, it is just to help you out once again
from equation 28 the maximum starting torque is achieved for s max t is equal to 1 that is r 2 dash will be is equal to root over r thevenin square plus x thevenin plus x 2 dash square
the content in the learning environment must provide mechanisms to enhance learner engagement; the designer should make sure that learners have sufficient support from the material itself, since they have to learn these on their own
similarly, for i 2 t 1 upon twelve 0 to t v 2 dt plus i 2 0
so, by varying this 112, we could actually get different lengths for the string
and for calculating the material cost variance, what we have to do here is for example first thing is material a
the stator current set up a rotating magnetic field in the air gap right
the steps involved in constructing the spiral are with o as center and radius oa first of all, we have to draw a circle
now what i do, what i say, is that instead of this single stage, i divide this computation into smaller steps
so, it is vacuum right
so, if you look into that , if you look into that, this one that current this was initially, voltage v is equal to 231 , angle 0 degree
i tried to find out whether or not that block is being used
now when you have r is equal to 1 ohm then c will be 0
if you calculate this value of a and if the resulting value of a is less than this value, that is the value that you have used in your previous calculations, it should, you get a converged value
so, the factor of safety in this case is defined as the material strength divided by the permissible stress, the ratio of the material strength to the permissible stress
that is this is should go into the receiver
does it look familiar
5 will only happen after 100 weeks of exposure
now if you look into early age expansion, here again we are seeing the effect of csa addition, right
so in this week we shall be starting with some discussions on low power design
now, primitive polynomial is a type of irreducible polynomial
they are the agents of customers, they are not the agents of the firms
so, current i which we saw in the previous example was 5 cos 60 pi t
once that is done draw join these lines because hidden line should not be visible in the case of isometric things, we remove those hidden lines
later in module 14, we talked about that operator, overloading for assignment operator is critical to define proper semantics for copy specifically with reference to deep and shallow copy
by replacing the feedback resistance with a capacitor, we get the rc network connected across the operational amplifier feedbacks
now percentage is the remainder operation
so in terms of a circuit diagram it can look like this
this has to be line current as well as phase current because it is star connected
number 4 is contempt; so, contempt which basically means hatred or guilt or unhappiness with something, is also a pretty easy read
so, to write down the final expression is the crack when not going to form at mid height and the fact is this is dependent on several factors, the distribution of load and therefore it is possible that the, it depends on the distribution of the compression in the wall itself due to the superimposed loads
so we will put the value of is that is u lambda minus u lambda minus two, that is the value of is which we calculated
so, in order to pass on this false impact the person can overdo can over gaze and may result in steering at another person
so, it is quite easy to continue from there and say ok, no more corrosion
so i am essentially having a wire like this, right
and we see that the frequency of the ripples for the triangular taper is actually half that of the exponential taper and this is because of the presence of the sync square term for this expression gamma in of the triangular taper
it is finally, you are not going to do this integration is in my hand you are going to code up something right
the unit area is known as the strength of the impulse function and when an impulse function has a strength other then unity, the area of the impulse is equals to it is strength right
so that is the key
so let say so, a has to be connected to e and i, i can connect to a, i can connect to e, i can connect to any of the middle point
so, if i talk about cumulative, it will actually be falling even below the shunt motor characteristics in the case of motoring operation when i talk about speed versus torque
therefore if you substitute all you will get t is equal to z phi l into i r upon 2 pi r l into p by a newton metre that is or we can write same question t is equal to z phi i a upon 2 pi into p by a newton metre, or your 0
so, now this mechanical system which we have now we saw in case of the example have been converted into equivalent node representation of the mechanical system
ok, so this full adders, intermediate connections, we can defines some wires and we instantiate four copies of full adders, add represents of full adder whose description is here, as you can see, this is the full adder, what you have carry out and sum as the outputs, a, b and c, y in as the inputs
we will see that sag and tension including the effect of your snow covered conductor and as well as your what you call that that temperature variation
this is based on a concept called boolean difference
so if i call this as the magnetic field line, how many times the magnetic field line is encountering the current that is actually known as the mmf
so this continues and you have to check if this shear force can now be transmitted successfully by the diaphragms and also the connections, the shear connections between the diaphragms and the components and the load assisting components
the next condition is analogous because we have seen that there is a sort of symmetry between e and h fields
so, v is equal to v m by root 2, the rms value, right
second one is the profit planning and third one is the evaluation of the performance and the fourth one is the decision making, different type of decisions can be taken
now, first commercially monolithic op amp, first commercially successful monolithic op amp was found in 1965, 1965 ok
so, maybe let us say 20 mm, then that is the thing; maybe 60 mm we would like to specify
so that begs the question, why was he sleeping late
now next is the overcompensation: so, usually usually ah the series capacitor size is elect selected for a distribution feeder application in such a way that the result and capacitive reactance is smaller than the inductive reactance of the feeder circuit
then adjust for non operating items
1 times 10 to the 19 per centimeter cube
floor wise you will use only a plan area of a floor if it is, if you are using for the entire building then you would add up all the floor areas
the coulomb force one over r square
or say, if we consider a series resonator in series like this, so this is the band pass case of course because we have either a series resonator in series or a shunt resonator in shunt
each zone has it is own close and far phases which we shall discuss and at the same time there are cultural and locational aspects related with them, which will also be discussed
now this table shows you the result of a test pattern generation program
here also we can draw the magnetic circuit, and we can solve like this right
so, this proportionality constant is nothing but, the inductance of that element through which the voltage is measured and current is changing with respect to time
so, this is the basic concept of isa relationship which we want to bring in in the context of c++ programming
now i would like to introduce an impedance here
well, of course, as i said, we will be coming into the layout aspects later, but with respect to how the layout looks like, i am just showing you a schematic side by side, you see
so, i have to solve for these to solve for
so the next month is september
now if you see phasor for voltage
so you could also search and we will also try to share a document which comprises of all the various commands the gdb has and you can actually try various things with gdb and also try to do such debugging with various other programs using gdb, look at the various registers and see how the stack and other local variables are maintained, thank you
if it is fourth quadrant there also first the point projected onto vertical plane somewhere here, then project it on to horizontal plane rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise
average working days in the month are 25, a worker works for seven hours in a day
ut is the input vector, say, if there are n input variables then the input vector will have say if there are p input variables
so i could look at the contents of the stack again are like follows and what we see is that now the stack has actually gone down to ffffcf44 and the reason for this is because of this subtract instruction which is essentially allocating 16 bytes of data who hold buffer 1 and buffer 2
two nor gates; each of them will have 2 inputs and 1 output
no it wont the incident field will not come here because, it is already the scattered field, there is nothing to subtract from it, what is the need to subtract think physically, the boundary condition applies to the scattered field, my variable is scattered field
so, in the sales and production budget, they are the part of the operating budget
so this is what is meant
so, what we do in a dc machine is to make sure that the maximum contribution comes from the mutual inductance between the stator and rotor and that essentially contribute to you know the torque being simply m times
so let say i am using kernighan lin bipartitioning algorithm to get a good partition of these gates
so, either you can apply signal through channel one, or you can apply signal through channel 2, or you can apply signal through both channels simultaneously, right
but if my temperature rises to thirty five degrees, my circuits might fail because some transistors might not be working hm properly, may not be switching as per the specification, so it is not really possible to test against all possible environmental variations and the possibilities
in the month of january, previous month is december and 30% of the december sales will be collected in the month of january
so, this is my your this thing, then z actually, z actually v arrow divided by your i arrow
so what decides whether the transistor is is in saturation in this particular circuit are the values of vd 0 and vg 0
so, what about the x dependence of this, delta is going be a delta x then delta y
so charge density goes down
similarly, if we leave out the last position like this, then we implicitly assume that the last position the slice is the length of this list of the string and so it goes to the last possible value
allow the learner to be able to have attached a human to compute a touch that can make him or her feel like he is in the learning process and then always make the author or the teacher visible
now, what is charge, charge is nothing but c into v
so, the fourth one is very important right so, this should be in your mind
so, and this what i can assume is that since my object this is let us say my point r prime right that is where i am evaluating this, is somewhere which is far away right that was the definition of rcs r trending to be very away from the object and my object is something over here ok
10,000 is the sales over and above the $10,000 will be how much
so, it will be minus 100, then plus your this current is this 12 ohm resistance, that a current is your flowing through this 12 ohm resistor is i so, plus 12 i, right
once again your temperature is low enough that you can ignore any contribution from the valence band of silicon
now, just look at the nature of this solution
so, if you overload those behaviors will get lost, you will have to be careful that after you overload those behaviors cannot be assumed
now, by default at least in my compiler, yes in this compiler by default compiling it with this particular syntax will create a load time relocatable code
then we are giving a delay of one second, here it is specified in millisecond
the power supply is off
so, this is the origin for this block block b this is the origin for block a and this is the origin of the complete assembly
if you are going to protect the small area like that there is absolutely no sense in using an impressed current cathodic protection because you got the whole system to install to just protect the small area whereas here you put few anodes in, that is it
so, as you as from figure a, we get i f 1 is equal to 250 upon 51 ampere because, if you look into this figure, this is your 250 volt and this is 250
this is the final expression for dynamics power, right
so, you know sometimes you may have seen human characters, like not cartoonish character
so, 20 minus micro farad and 30 micro farad capacitors are in series, if you look into that 20 and 30 micro farad capacitors are in series
we have referred to the position of touch and how it can have different cultural variations
so for convenience i take calculate the potential alo[ng] on the z axis, although because of the spherical symmetry the potential is going to be same all around at the same distance
the other way of classifying couplers is based on a property in the s parameter matrix and page on this we can have 2 different types of couplers, one is called 180¡ coupler and the other is the 90¡ coupler
so, assuming no obstacles, a vertical line through s and a horizontal line through t will intersect, and vice versa
so, i am going to have essentially this i minus if whatever is the current that is not contribute, that is not going to contribute towards m m f production
what is the functionality of the c p
so, once it is done, we will be in a position to construct this part
so, for example, this case where two plates are connected with a lag joint, p is the tensile force acting and there is a bolt here
so, that has to be a little bit of background or introduction should be described first
and the initial costs of the equipments are also quite different
the claims will demarcate the boundaries of the intellectual property when it comes to a patent right
and therefore, you can write this solution you can rearrange this terms a bit and you will find the solution
it's a constraint which i'll ignore and therefore the z dependence of a finally comes out to be a z is equal to mu naught k over two modulus z, with the minus sign in the y direction
007 i told you right how it will come
so, m and n are the two arguments which could be any number like any function
thus i 1 will be equal to i 2 equals to nothing but 0, infinite input impedance means current cannot flow, that is why it is 0
this document is available
so, and simplify you add and simplify you will get omega 2 minus omega 1 upon omega 1 omega 2c plus omega 2 minus omega 1 l is equal to 2 r right
so, using this way we will be in a position to construct isometric views of given projections
recall that this half cycle is missing from i d, but v d s continues to be a sinusoid just like before
376 hours, 376 hours and what is the actual time
and whenever you want to start the process of conversion, there are typically two interfaces, soc and eoc
given the netlist, you calculate a, a, t, i, a, t and the slack values
so, now the circuit in the high voltage winding to sorry current in the high voltage winding while low voltage winding is short circuited
now, when we discuss divergence theorem, remember d s is taken to be pointing out of the volume
now the waveform, all the waveforms are exactly similar as the previous except the magnetizing demagnetizing waveform
so, that will be put onto port 2 because through that this external address bus will be connected to the external ram
so, li, this insertion loss is given by this relationship and for say a low pass filter, li should be high, should be low in the passband and high in the stop band
as you can note that scopes may be named or unnamed; like class scope will always have to have a name
on off controller means we either turn on or turn off the device depending on whether the measured value is less than or greater than the preset
now, what is it that we need to do
shunt excited means i am going to have actually the dc armature is connected in parallel with the field, right
this is a glass and it is a 5 inch mask, it looks like this
you have seen earlier that a schottky junction is formed, when the work function of the metal is greater than the work function of the semiconductor
so, this is the configuration
so, to some extent we learned under cost accounting that cost reduction process but largely we learned under management accounting
so this particular property is called time delay or time shift property of the laplace transform
so, accounts receivable now will be calculated as that part of the collection for the august sales, part of the collection of the july sales and then that amount will work out as the total accounts receivable and that accounts receivable will take directly, that information will take directly to the balance sheet
it also creates problem to the company if the debt equity ratio is high because you are taking more and more risk when you are going for more and more debt
we have been discussing so much about the voltage across the transistor
so, it always starts from the company function generators and that is fine
now when actually the current was not flowing, still maybe i was having the distance of x and when the current is flowing, if the current is not strong enough i am definitely going to have still that distance maintained as x because the spring is going to hold it at that particular place whether we like it or not
so, we require oil and water in the factory and how much that amount is 500 rupees
so then with now two tones present, the output y t will be given likeé okay, will be something like this
now, he is asking the observer 1 hey what is the field inside ok
the first rule is very important it says that all parameters to the right of a parameter with default argument must all have default arguments
like this, therefore, i should be going down in the rod and therefore in the loop it should be going like this
naturally a question arises which are the types of the real time operating systems which support virtual memory
let us look at the c++ form for this
so, i have another function which is called pretty if i do this then it shows me the 4 queen solution in a more readable form right
one can have complete section show that; but it is because of symmetric object, the same thing one will be in a position to sense it on the other side
so, that why it happened because our initial assumption of exponential solution is incorrect for this particular case of critical damping
so, today we will discuss the various properties of resistors, capacitors, and inductors
when switch is closed this c 1 and c 2 are in parallel; that means, an both are equal right; that means, it will c 1 plus c 2 that is it will become 2 micro farad because both are in parallel when switch is closed right so, in this case ah sorry let me clear it
so, usually the act of signalling an error is called raising an exception
but at the same time in the professional world we have to be aware that our smile can also be used as a mask
if it is a large structure rotating at a very high speed and if you actually look at the linear velocity what is going on around the rim of or around the peripheral surface of the rotor that is going to be enormously high
that is equal to material price variance rupees 1150 favorable plus rupees, rupees 375
ok thank you we will be back again
such copies have a lot more of meaning in terms of c++
so having examined the effective height, the way it is considered in the design, effective length, how it is considered in the design and the effective thickness, once you make an estimate of these values, you take the two ratios, effective height to effective thickness or effective length to effective thickness and the lesser of the two slenderness ratios are taken
ma’am, in the secondary coil the voltage could be 1000 kilovolts, and it might be applied like…
now, let us before we get into solving this, what do you think is the most sort of intuitive coordinate systems to solve this problem
so, i will get an update relation between e and h which is what i wanted all along then we will see what happened to that running history
average price is also given for last 5 years
so, this is the height this is my 26 right
so, is equal to we can write that means, the maximum value of the emf generated e m will be 2 pi b a small n into capital n right
so longer the line, longer will be the values of rc and, as you know, for any rc kind of a network we refer to as it as rc delay
in middle school the pressure or studies and the uncertainty because, teenager there is a lot of hormonal changes are happening
so, this is how one can plot your what you call that your gate function and this is the things are very simple let me tell you things are very simple
hence all regions outside this input stability circle must be stable
now if you are asked to calculate the phase angle between two voltage signals, that is v1 is equal to minus 10 cost 50 t plus 50 degree and v2 is equal to 12 sine 50 t minus 10 degree
then let me, this is the class b we know, c is a b so this is what we draw here
this is the simple i am talking about this this ratio is this is the simple current ratio and when you talk about the adjusted current ratio now how you have to calculate the adjusted current ratio
now the previous example was an example of what we called as passive bias network
as the name suggests, it is about not showing profit unless it is extremely confirmed, but showing all losses whenever there is a slight likelihood of a loss
now here again should we take pbt or should we take profit before exceptional items
there click new
so, any questions on this before we go to two dimensions, if you have two nodes can you say that again if you have 2 nodes
so, first of all we have the attacker over here and we will assume that the attacker is able to choose the values of p0 and p4 as required, so the attacker chooses p0, p4 for attack, triggers an encryption to occur
in this instruction what we do is add the offset of the got table, the global offset table to this ecx register
i will show you the screen, i have cleared out the data
we will see observe the output at vo we have to observe the output which is at here vo
so if you are interested in having symmetrical limits which is mostly the case, you should adjust your swing limits so that you do have symmetry
so, let us single step through a few more instructions let us say the single step through four instructions and look at the contents of the stack
welcome to another module of this course òmicrowave integrated circuitsó
the ballistic galvanometer does not have much friction; ideally no friction at all and the amplitude of this oscillation that means, from here to here this amplitude is proportional to the charge flown within that small time
another implementation of the bend is what is called as the mitred bend
so you can say that when we compare the definition of laplace transform shows that s is this, the standard definition and you simply replace s by s by a while you change the dummy variable t with x
so, people are so focused on giving medicine, doing small follow ups that to really sit back and listen to everybody woes everybody’s difficulty in sorting out their life problems; it becomes a luxury right, but that is not the way actually
if you try to disorganize it then storage becomes problematic
and then compare it with other material that are available and choose the material wisely with this we have come to the end of the experiment thank you for watching
now let us say the flux are in the steady state, at the point of starting it is at one side of the core
cognitive behavior therapy, then cognition and behavior have been described by psychology or not psychiatry right
so, this is actually its figure a
now, therefore, if you divide e1 / e2 you will get n1/n2 therefore, if you divide these2 equations e1 / e2 you will get n1 / n2 therefore, e1 / n1 = e2 / n2 that is induced emf per turns is constant that is e1 / n1 = e2 / n2
so now my question will be to look ahead and say now we are going to apply design thinking as such on this product which we will show to the audience of course and how do we take this forward and how do we use this four steps of empathize, analyze, solve and test again one more time and see how to move it forward that is going to be our focus the 5 of us are going to focus on this for this course
so, many circuits we have solved right and your so, easily you can find out what is the voltage, right
702 or it will be 4
he has put across in this book his seminal theory about our perception of a space and use of interpersonal distances to mediate their interactions with other people
similarly, within a board you can think of the chips, how to place the chips
this looks like a fan
similarly, we are looking in this direction, so based on these lines, we will get one more circle, concentric with that
so, what is that become
this is what is the open circuit characteristics of the machine when it is functioning as a generator clearly
so, is easy we identify that yes this is anode this is cathode, if you do reverse thing we will not be able to see anything correct
here you look at this circuit that i am showing
so, but is the second previous month here
we have an energy band from sigma star that is completely empty and then you have a band gap between them
so, this delta function is your the your usual dirac delta function right
wwhich is 2
the hardware trojan in such a scenario would look something like this
so, the and the waveform across the meter
so, with the help of signal flow graph and or may be the block diagram which we just saw, we can compile this information, we can write ec by e that is the transfer function for output ec
so, yesterday we discussed about mesh analysis and we also discussed that how the mesh analysis would be done if current sources available
now think of various types of environmental changes that take place
no, it is not only i think about the permissibility that the child enjoys, i also think say for instance if the school starts say like a cricket coaching academy, many schools have it now
now, all of this follows the same algorithm for multiplication, but if i want to express them, code them in c language, i will need to provide all different names
it is very elegant and it has itõs own uses and features
now, in the case of any device, we always want to improve the efficiency of the device
now, if we say no this i because this is the current we are passing this is in our control
because it is this current entering here it is the minus terminal
now, i would like to use one more line to join like a triangle, then i will pick that one and click that one
in this case in this case, we have taken say v a n, then c, and then b, if this is phase a c b sequence
then part of the current assets must be in the form of marketable securities and then part of the current asset will be in the form of the accounts receivables and then part of this will be in the form of inventories right
so, remember we had when we wrote our solution to the bessel differential equation i got two terms h naught 1, h naught 2
now, when we say that we are using the breadboard we are we are mounting the resisters, we are mounting the capacitors and we are mounting transistors
because, we do not have any loop which is not touching the forward path
i am showing just one signal
but as you put it here then i dash actually will be id minus j i q minus i c because it is the; that means, this much of reduction right
so ideally you should have said something like result is equal to update, and then check after the update where the result is true or false
and if you remember we have seen this ic earlier also right
the allocated chunk looks something like this do you have the metadata over here corresponding to previous and the size and the various bits like n and p and you have the data which is present here while the free chunk comprises of the metadata as before the previous chunk and the size and the various flags but importantly we have the forward pointer and the back pointer present in the free chunk
is there are some lossy medium
in other words if we say that paths(i, j) is the quantity we want to compute, we want to count the number of paths from (0, 0) to (i, j)
so, true is the opposite of false
so we are essentially now diversifying from mentioning a sinusoidal quantity as a phasor to indicating that as a complex number
vertical and horizontal lines are in two different layers so that even if some lines are crossing, there is no short circuit because the vertical lines are on one layer, horizontal line is on a different layer
so, rt does not have any component coefficient there so you will connect r with s to the power ny with only unit gain
so, this is the revision for you all for volume integral i want to eliminate one variable
we assume that the material has no tensile strength, which means the moment you reach eccentricity, the moment you reach an eccentricity equal to the middle third of the cross section, you get the conditions for cracking because zero tensile stress has been arrived at the extreme fibre
so, we used this expression and with the help of the failure criterion, the morculum failure criterion in terms of cohesion and the friction coefficient, described the failure of the masonry joint, the horizontal bed joint in terms of a reduced cohesion and a reduced friction coefficient, the reduction occurring because now you have the definition of the geometry of the joint with respect to the unit where delta y and delta x are the unit dimensions delta y along the y axis and delta x the length of the unit itself
but right now it is very important for you to know where from you get all this information
so now you have an expression for p and an expression for delta 0, and together you will be able to look at the force displacement relationship in the case of the wall with the dimensions as we started with
two phase induction motor will normally have two windings
so basically you would have a situation of principal stresses acting with tension and compression and failure is expected to occur perpendicular to the direction of principal tension
so, prior art references can be, you find another description to a patent number here 4600327, again an existing invention which is related to this
we will use the super mesh and apply kvl to that super mesh
that is why quick brown was 15 letters plus a backslash n, fox was a 3 plus backslash n
we have learnt these four things
for example, normally we are stature conscious when we shake hands and a person who is holding a higher stature offers the hand to be shaken
so, this is the less known mechanism and we will see that of course, this is not very clean mechanism this is we will need remember how many points of function can come back from and obviously, everything will have to be pre decided pre designed and so on
as compared to emotional levels and non emotional behaviors, for example no the memory for receiving a gift from one of the parents will be better, okay
so, all the numbers are given
sometimes, you know, we want to introduce an inductive parameter within a waveguide
the way you calculate it is by recognizing that in steady state id has to be equal to 200 microamperors or i0 in general
click ok
so, from here in our next class, we will further build up the story, how this whole facility will eventually look
so, it is also kilovolt right
for instance the yellow queen attacks the blue square on the diagonal which was already attacked by the first queen
what do you do then
so if there are ten such parallel wires we have to layout, the total amount of space you have to give will be ten into w plus s
ok, when will be the output
i'll also now the actual figures
the mass, the analogous quantity is i for the particle, the moment of inertia, the velocity, sorry, the momentum, the linear momentum, the analogous quantity is the angular momentum g and the kinetic energy half m v square goes over to j square by 2 i the one dimensional motion you remember the momentum was replaced in quantum mechanics by the derivative operator minus ih bar d by d x where p is obviously sorry if you put the vector arrow you should not put the subscript here because that's a component of the momentum if you put the vector arrow this is gradient operator therefore this is also a vector so the momentum p is you put the vector arrow, this is gradient operator, therefore this is also a vector
this is going to be what is the standard cost of standard mix
so, this is the metal let us say metal that we want to evaporate
so, if say we are say some where 10 of us are there and we all are genetically different
so, it gives you a lot of real life functionality ok
means as if the transmission line is never present
this whole thing, star
so, for example for the chunk of memory a1 the metadata is present
so, with that, we will bring this discussion to an end and subsequently we will look at the physical interpretation of these terms
so, read bar signal is given similarly if you want to write like if you want to write the content of a register on to external dat[a] on to external memory
suppose this is given suppose this this is unsymmetrical waveform suppose peak is given 10 volt right and t by 4 t by and this this side it is minus 5 volt this is plus 10 volt right
all these three different types of accounting systems or say types of accountings they go hand in hand
now can you explain to me what’s happening
so, what is a general prescription is that if you have multiple possible hierarchies in a domain then you should choose one which is the dominant one, that is one way of looking at even that may help you get read of multiple inheritance in in many places is as the vehicle hierarchy
so now, 4 kilo hertz (5 – 1) is 4 kilo hertz
basis function which basis function
we are in a competitive economy which is called as the economy controlled by the customers not by the sellers
so we need at least 10 frames and therefore this just holds f equal to 2
copper, remember, is a very high conductivity ah material
so, this is the expression for the sinusoidal voltage, right
so, the sequence is not as per the formal or the official sequence
we took the help of breadboard, on which we have mounted the circuit, and we have seen the change in the signals, when we apply some input signal and a change in output signal which you can measure as change in voltages, right
so, pass a surface a bezier curve in that way
so, this is in some sense problem 3 is the most challenging problem because, i have very little information yet i want to try to map the whole earth ok
so, it means that loss is here because of what reasons which department has contributed to what extent and why the loss has occurred that we will be trying to find out
so, also does the scattered field satisfy the maxwell’s equations right
can you draw the input output characteristic of a comparator; of a comparator ok
if we plot both of them, so this will become v 1 t is nothing but vm sine om t which starts from origin, while v2t is vm sine omega t plus 5 which starts before origin
so, in terms of that its simply the cross product of e and h ok, it does not get simpler than that
one thing i have just mentioned: layout verses schematic
as a student of this subject you have to very carefully distinguish between the difference between the price and the cost
but apart from that there can be a rotor which is also rotating
so, this is less write it over here 2 d polar coordinates, but when we move to the 3d example we will take spherical polar coordinates for using the symmetry; just fine right
they are fixed cost, variable cost and the semi variable cost
so, in today's class we will learn more about this first quadrant projections
what will be the depreciation every year
now similarly you can calculate the material price variance
so there are four, two input nand gates
so if it is minus then your output will be minus of cos omega t
peer learning involves the acquisition of skills and knowledge achieved through interaction with others
this model is built out of 12 design parts in this solidworks that we can see it like this; the blades, the rotor in stator, the casing, the pedestal and the stand
similarly, purchases are going to be in the month of june depending upon the sales, how much sales we are going to make in the month of june
local edge number
because it depends on u of x; so, at whatever x i am i put this right
so, that is why that your what you call leader stoke moves
so, for delta connected source or load line voltage is equal to phase voltage because, both are delta delta, there is no question neutral no an bn cn these all line to line
so, this angle is ∅0 and it is your what your call component along ∅ is i m = your i0 sin ∅, this component is responsible for producing that your no load flux because this is ∅0
ok field connections like i talked about, you can have deck level connections, connections at the deck level where the bridge deck two panels of the deck are connected by uhpc like you see in these figures or you can have the deck or the girder connected to the support structure also through uhpc so multiple ways of doing it
this is the code that is fairly simple and straightforward
so, this transformer will be transformer under test, whereas this transformer will be isolation transformer, got it
so this cell labeling scheme that is used in hadlocks algorithm, i mean use a, something called detour numbers
so if my ia is somewhat like this then please note phi f is here, phi a may be somewhere here depending upon what is the reluctance offered and so on and so forth
now what these new attacks actually showed was that even though the processor discussed the result due to speculation in such a case the speculative execution has an effect on the state of the processor, essentially due to this speculative execution of this memory axis or the state of the processor may be in the cache memories or the branch predictors or so on may be modified corresponding to the data which gets accessed
if we are doing that we call that as lofted surfaces
so, little bitlittle bit you try to do it yourself right
after that with that r n ah all all your i s c that current source then r n, ah and then this 50 ohm all will be in parallel basically right
so, when i give you some assignments or homework, you have to work on them and feel free to ask me questions if you have any doubts
let us, take one example so that you can understand what we have discussed
the concentration of holes in the n side, we can use the law of mass action is nothing but ni2nd
you said that the scheduler each time needs to look at the jobs waiting to be executed
notice that this quantity d v, d p, d v is the a bulk modulus and therefore i can write it as minus b
so, if you are looking at a simply supported member or a continuous member, a beam or a wall, you use the smaller of the distance between the supports or the clear distance, a clear span between the supports plus an effective depth d of the section itself
continuous sir
for example the semi arid regions can be places where you can see a lot more attack because of sulphate because of the combined mechanisms of penetration as well as you have drying and wetting that happen in these kind of environments
the chain blocking arises when a task needs a number of resources
so, we are not going to go to the magnetic field we are going to go the second route to the electric field ok
so, generation actually chases the load sometimes we call load following that generator is following the load, right
fruit beer they wanted to introduce and they did because fruit beer is a very established product in the other countries market, many people use it is non alcoholic drink, anybody can use it and is really is good for the health also
so simple checks that you can do is if you assume there is a finite tensile permissible tensile stress that you want to consider for the masonry, how much does that contribute to the moment capacity
n and s it has to be there
because it gave us a certain physical meaning of outgoing waves so that is what we had
for example, what are the media we need to select, what are that various technologies, how do we integrate these technologies
but what we got here is a wafer with covering or protecting the interdigitated electrodes
now what is happening if you see here is that the values that are passed to gcd are getting smaller and smaller
now we'll go for the next schedule that is a purchase disbursement schedule
so, this was about the chain rule which gave us the a very convenient way to arrive at the idea of a gradient so, this is the gradient
after spin coating photoresist you have to pre bake it at 900c for 1 minute
the os would load the code segments of this particular program into this text segment, it would load the global data such as calls into the data segment and whenever there is a malloc like this, which is dynamically allocated data, so this data gets allocated into the heap
4 is kind of widely accepted number for opc system and pfa or fly ash base system are slightly low chloride threshold and lc3 has much lower chloride threshold when you talk about i meanö using this sact method i am calling s for simplify
so, the major employees of the company have created some partnership firms and the main company, enron, was invest in those firms so they were making private business wherein only they were the owners now in year 2000 kenneth lay who was the chairman of the company three times met dick cheney
now if i say that i am just taking a current carrying conductor of infinite length and let us say it is carrying a current of 1 ampere and i am looking at what is the magnetic field intensity around this at a distance of say 1 meter
so, what basically we see here in terms of mutation is that there is a role played by the genetic factor and there is also effective role that is played by the environmental factor
how you can use the oscilloscope to look at it
so, we need a suitable microcontroller for the processing, and also we need some sensors or actuators to build up the entire system
at omega equal to 2 into 10 to the power 3 we have; a beta equals to 0 degree as imaginary part is 0; while a beta equals to 1 thus the barkhausen criterion is satisfied correct, because a beta is 0 degree, and the a into beta is 1
one fundamental difference between list and string or indeed any of the values we have seen before is that a list can be updated in place
so, what you will be left with finally if you do like this, you will be left with the net current assets/total assets
you can do an extra photoelectron spectroscopy you can do an afm you can do a contact angle measurement analysis
firstly, it takes lot of time
so, large companies like ford or general motors or general electric were big companies
ok, so what i have shown is that if i have using all these vector identities, if i have the current carrying loop, which is small, then a r is given as mu zero over four
this is what we are looking at, right
you could have anticipated that by looking at the current and direction of the field that is given rise to
because it is a cylindrical object that is the reason we have dash dot line and this chamfering is not just 45 degrees one has to go, but how far we have to go thus, we are representing 0
so to do this, let us start with the equation: curl of b is equal to mu naught j
we connected this value of bias through a resistor
so, intentionally i have introduce private inheritance here that changes the access specification, what you can access, what you cannot access, but in terms of the dynamics of the object life time things do not really become different, they remain to be same
it gives me the same thing, this is 0 and this is 0 or i can also write this as u 1 up to u n and a column vector x 1 up to x n
now, so far what we have seen is something which is which is strongly in parallel to what we could do as structures
let's say voltage controlled voltage source
if it is minus 8 means that ah; that means, current actually is flowing like this it is flowing like this , if this 8 ampere the current is flowing like this ah, right
if we recall in the last two lectures we have seen that how we can interface devices like relays, dc motors etc
it is inherited from the parents, such type of changes which gets transmitted to the child from their biological parents that is germ line mutation
so, i will have to do call, redial that will be last dial and that will be my basic redial functionality
we will try to find out whether the labor rate has caused this negative variance, labor cost variance or labor efficiency or both
it will say that i am confused i am failing and then you will have to explicitly specify the template conversion argument conversion
and similarly fourth projection on to fourth line p 4
so, we start a listing our all the possible factors between one and 14 and testing them
so, this is your i ah; that means, ah this is your ah this is your ah i 75 by 11 ampere and v 0 is equal to approximately 18
job scheduler maintains a list of pending jobs with priorities
but in op amp, it will not be happy if you tell op amp, i give you positive feedback i give you positive feedback op amp will start oscillating and we cannot control, but if i apply negative feedback op amp works perfectly
so, microwave frequencies in this 1 to 10 gigahertz we can hope that i can get through and through pictures of the body and components are cheap ok
we prepare the profit and loss account we prepare the balance sheet
now i have in an in vitro condition which is outside the system
so, this will go inside over here
so, as long as n d is much higher than n i and all the atom are ionized, which is true in the case of silicon will find that n is same as n d
so this is going to be over r minus r prime cube
this reinforced concrete slab, we are interested in what is its in plane stiffness, what its in plain deformability
so we have taken an example like this: this is a simple combinational circuit we have taken
so if this becomes the reference node, this is no longer the supply and this is the positive supply
let us look at one particular direction going to the write, electric field is going to be perpendicular to that and source is going to be magnetic field
so now this charge, extra charge in the surface will start pushing in the same charge inside, pushing towards center
in that case, we just require two views only
so, we have now pictorially we have two list of the form 1, 3, 5, 7 stored somewhere
this is the way we unfold this box and their projections
it has same as asymptotic complexity as merge sort we saw before and unlike merge sort which forced us to create a new array everytime we merge two lists, this is actually creating a list in place
and, this is again from a typical compiler
similarly, if i have secretary and director then i can find things like e c t r e c t r in both of them by skipping over with judiciously
38 division which is health psychology division a very popularly talked about now a days this area basically looks at the health and illness through basic and clinical research integration of biomedical information about health and illness with current psychological knowledge and this special interest groups confined theselves to aging, women, and minority health issues
so in this standard cell design style, your layout area will look like this, where there will be several rows in which you are expected to put in the standard cells one by one
similarly, if i want to increase the delay, i can make it narrower, i can make it two r
so, if it is so, you proceed to the next step and then calculate the area of steel, calculate the area of steel corresponding to an a given by the expression here
so, derivative of that constant value becomes 0
so this we call it as the ah next state and this we call it as the present state: p s and there is a clock which will be feeding the flip flop
octave is a matlab like environment which is very helpful in scripting and automating many of your design tasks
at 5, this is precisely on the grid map, so connect that
so that is as far as the persona is concerned, the second that we saw the last time was the phases that we tracked them
so we are going to be mathematical, little more rigorous than the arguments that we gave in the previous lecture
so, that makes it very convenient and very nice to start programming because you do not have to learn a lot of things in order to write even basic programs
this is the acid that we can use to etch the silicon dioxide
the earlier styles where of assignment where we will say top, assigned one, or we will say data assigned new char tan like this
so, in this third angle system is more like transparent planes and glass boxes are intermingled with each other
you also required the usb mini to usb typeb connector
so, 2 plus this 3 equivalent your thing will be 5 henry equivalent inductors right so let me clear it
similarly, in the front view this ab o surface will be visible
frequency is one kilohertz, one kilohertz is a frequency, alright
so, in this way we are able to get a diverse set of different type of gadgets in fact for x86 platforms the number of gadgets that can be found is extremely high because of the large number of instructions that are supported
so we have taken that as an absolute starting point from our work
so in this model i am looking the path to ground
so cost sheet helps us in controlling the cost of production, in reducing the cost of production
let us look at it step by step, in that case first of all we have to realign this entire set square into right perpendicular planes so that we will be in a position to draw it
so, what we will do next is we look at a simple; very very simple antenna which is called a hertz dipole where this j term is extremely simple ok
so, this has only one input ok, because the other one is constant it is not changing, but this circuit has 2 inputs you can change both of them ok
so, you use a material that ensures uniform transfer of load from the steel platon to the brick unit itself
to hold it, we use this clip arrangement ; to hold it tightly, we require these clips, sometimes people use pins also
and similarly, when the output v0 must be pushed up, current must be pushed into the output node
when we wrought d, which is equal to minus v, d p by d v, we did not specify whether there, at constant temperature or adiabatic
and whatever value is stored in the database, you can actually analyze it based on that you can plot that as well
first, identifying all those things and then after that thing, i will search on internet like what is the most common question that they ask, so that i have a very short time, i cannot read the whole concept in one time
so, let me draw the energy band diagram, when the junction is formed to do that we know that the fermi levels must essentially line up at equilibrium
so, it can be both way, but at one point of time only one direction the information will flow
now, let us take one example so that you can better understand the term of phasor
so, for co2 emissions for converting the inventory data to an impact what we have said is the best way is to get a sample of the material say coal and do a what is called as chns analysis, so what does chns analysis do
you see, for l f s r, the all zero pattern has, ah, very, you can say, dangerous implication, like, once you load this l f s r with all zero pattern, it will remain in the all zero state because x or of zero and zero will be zero
after that you divide v by z you will get the i right so, this is my fg
that's why on the board you need different type of people
now motor, if i by calculation want a motor that is 7
b is the viscous frictional coefficient
we will select this and the two planes that we need angle between with is this and this plane
so suppose this is the gain circle that you are interested in, select a point, gamma l then that is the value of gamma l that you choose for your design
so, 3 ampere current is this is actually p 1 and this is your p 2
so, oled’s are useful mainly for display devices, they can easily be a thermally evaporated on to a substrate, but one of the problems with oled’s is of course, the cost that is involved and the life span of these organic materials stability of the organic material is another issue, water damage is an issue there, but oled’s are again another type of led's which are based upon organic materials
here, if you see the first question to answer is, who are you trying to help really in this case
so, this is called the binding compile type
i say it is rupees 4
so, hysteretic behavior in a in plain flexible mechanism is typically characterized by good deformation capacity, good ductility, but low energy dissipation capacity
now, if i apply a voltage across this meter which is say v equals say this v is equal to 1 volt ok
so this is what
so let me type g shem, enter, and you will see a g y something like this opens up
drift means you withdraw
when you have an integrated circuit, the number of transistors doesn't matter
7 centimeter these are given these are the data right
so, this is one way
the architectural and construction firm shimizu has developed computerized techniques to deliver scents through air conditioning ducts, so that the efficiency of the employees can be enhanced and the stress level can be reduced
so, we are in terms of improving this app so we want to show our viewers how to start a basic prototype of an app and how to improve the app by taking customer feedback the information you get, what do you mean
so, what happens dynamically when i reduce the voltage, when i actually i am operating a 220 volt, let us say, the speed was, we said 1400 rpm
so, put i 1 here is equal to 2 ampere and then you solve for i 2 and this is and shaken circuit shaken circuit is given for your what you call for thevenin, here it is given i 3 and i 4 v o c is equal to just for the purpose of computation v thevenin
there is no change in my output voltage characteristics
so it means acceptance to ensure the acceptance we will have to do the budgeting by involving the people at the lowest level in the firm, then information has to flow from the bottom to top and then a document has to be created
now suppose we have a block of shape like this you want to place
now if you take these 2 examples, both of them have been the winners of bronze and silver medals in respective sports, but one where you have the history of somebody playing in the family and in the other case where you do not have this history
so, in that case the equivalent representation of the gear train with viscous friction, coulomb friction and inertia as lumped parameters is considered, which is shown in the figure
so, we talked about light interacting with matter the basic thing we said was said that the energy of the light e must be greater than some interaction energy within the semiconductor
this is your what you call v s is the steady state response ah and this is transient response
so you see that because of this green field which has been given rise to by this sigma cosine theta, field inside will reduce a bit
so, there is no distinction between single character and multiple characters
if it is such a good algorithm, it is efficient, simple, why is it that none of the applications, i mean very few applications use it
but phasor analysis has its own limitations because it cannot be applied in very wide variety of inputs
i can say that if i look at l di by dt equal to n d phi by dt, this is a you know relationship expressed in the form of faraday’s law but when we look at it in terms of electrical circuit; because we always refer to the magnetism that is occurring associated with the alternating current by including a fictitious quantity called inductance
in all of these cases, if you add them as dopants to the silicon the extra electron will be ionized
so, what we will do is that we will enable each of these one by one and then we will see how this shell code is prevented
so even if the lowest transistor is very heavily switching, so the current switching and charging, discharging impact will be the least, because it is just down this track [vocalized noise] lowest down this stack right
so, if you if r you say 10 watt machine for example, and if it operates at 10 kilowatt that is actually your call and corresponding current will be full load current, and that is the full load power and corresponding slip will be your full load slip
so, some person by the name of simpson discovered this rule, i mean if you were born 300 years ago, it would be named after you right; it is nothing very great about it
so, in this case that if you say that current is for this branch the current is flowing from node 3 to node 2 say, then it will be your this current is ah entering into the node and other 2 are leaving at node 2
now when i go over here this i can you conceivably have four shape functions over here
10 electron volts; e fi is located in the middle, so this is 0
i think it is 6 or 7 year, you cannot tell what is the pros and what is lies
so, this would be the total solution of the equation that is the second order equation related to our series rlc circuit
let us see another parameter which is output short circuit current, what is that how much current the op amp can source or saying from the output pin, the output voltage could drop near 0 volts when derived delivering the maximum current typically the op amp cannot deliver more than 50 milli ampere
that one condition is that your rl becauseyour square root termyou areyou are under the root this term have to be positive
so, that like your that it is same way you are putting that mutual inductance voltage generator in frequency domain we are writing it
as we did in the first case, we will mark every item as asset and liability and then prepare a balance sheet
can i ask what does a mean
so, if is zero at this point and when field current is zero still i will have at least some amount of generated voltage
so if you see this you will simply represent it as f1 maybe t convolution of f2 t and then the outer integral is nothing but the laplace of the convolution of f1 and f2
heap is a binary tree with two properties, the first property is structural: which are the values which are stored in the tree, remember that leaves, nodes in a binary tree may have 0 children, 1 children or 2 children
so, v by root over r square plus omega l square both side of this equation of this equation you divide by root over r square plus omega l square
however, there are certain societal sections, as well as certain cultural groups in which this gesture means something opposite
but c and d are the new products added in the series
second is second is that the voltage difference right
so this is essentially the characteristic for shunt as well as separately excited and also for pmdc motor
and maybe that company can be avoided also rewarded also because say very good paymaster taking care of the needs of their small suppliers
that is why it is important to know whether it is a name error or an index error or something else
so the simpler scalar expression if is also dc, ia is also dc
now we have the rest of three instructions as was here before and at the end just before the return from the function there is a check which is done to detect whether the canary has changed or not
3 degree volt
the more and more you spread the network higher and better is your semantic memory, okay
so with respect to this, let us try to estimate what will be the total propagation delay of this pair of inverters
so if the reluctance is changing because the permeability is changing due to saturation, the inductance will not be a constant any more, this we already discussed, right
each instruction is of size 32 bits, so you will have to increase it by 4 bytes
so, you can say at what point d vr divided by d phi l equal to 0, you can try deriving this and this will be able to give you clearly at what point voltage regulation is minimum and at what point voltage regulation is maximum, okay
so, i will start preparing this sheet, balance sheet by taking the assets on the top
similarly, for reverse also let me take half of it r2 dash by 2 x2 dash by 2 because both are equally influenced by forward and reverse rotating magnetic fields
so, we find that proxemics is not only a study of the distance, which people maintain with each other in different ways, but it is also a study of a space as it is being created and organized in other aspects of our experiences
lets try to explain this first
we now know the technique of drain feedback biasing, but our aim is to realize a common source amplifier with a smaller gain sensitivity
so, then what are the unknowns inside this
at the time instance 6, the third instance of t1 arrives and because it has a shorter deadline then the t2 it again preempts t2, t1 starts running and then t2 starts running
so, what is the variable that i have a here h z is here at the centre right and the other two variables are
now, draw the projectors to locate top view and true length on that vertical plane
and then after finding out this transmission coefficient and the input reflection coefficient, we plugged it in the question for the power gain and we derived the expression for the power again
so, this the way the diagram has been drawn it looks like a frog that is leaping in some sense right
so, here in terms of the mobile this was the overloaded in terms of the smart phone
for second method, now from figure three, ah, we can write
they are given by the unit vectors x hat cross h y hat cross right i can decompose a vector into any 3 orthogonal directions that i want
so, we add acceptors and the concentration of acceptors, n a is 10 to the 16
so, again you if you if you guys remember, the circuit for the input bias current is the same circuit we can have for input offset current
so, this is just observe the y movement, y movement is only this much
so, again, the analysis will take place
the current in the resistor is vs minus vd by r and that is equal to the current in the diode which is the diode saturation current times exponential vd by vt minus 1
as you can see this is your stm microcontroller board and the circuit for the bulb that i have shown
and with that the component level design is complete
so, this is something member function is a completely new concepts for c++ no parallel of this exist in c
0 and this is yc what will yn be
now, in general we may have other spaces
so, this is that your diagram this is your that resultant flux phi r and f2 will interact with each other and this will be the your what you call the direction of this area or direction will be your what you call this resultant will be fr right
the extension of newton’s law of motion for rotational motion states that the algebraic sum of moments or torque about a fixed axis is equal to the product of the inertia and the angular acceleration about the axis
so, what is the b here, b is the fixed transaction cost b is the fixed transaction cost b is the fixed transaction cost this is b and what is the t, t is the total requirement of cash, total requirement of cash over a period of time say a year in 1 year
for example, we can have a nested list
so, it's a dominance of a state and the minority shareholders' rights are not protected, they don't have much rights as such
so, we had two temperatures t s and t i
because this will help me a lot in terms of making search for where exactly is my ppp presentation that i have to use today
in case this layer is not is not is very thin then what will happen is you may have a wave that enters back into the computational domain if the layer thickness is thin right
so, so, in this case, so r thevenin will coming 60 by 19 ohm right
so, now, we will we will have to see many different mating mating methods that are available in solidworks
so, this becomes off; this becomes on, so this pin gets grounded
so, last lecture, we have seen the input bias current, right
so this means that when we have to change our cities, when we have to demolish we are going to have a lot of trouble, we are going to bring down all this buildings and what are we going to do with the base that we have generate when we have demolition
if you observe any behavior of a group in a bit of death after removing all the modern social etiquettes and protocols; you will find the same thing, the king would be sitting and the chief will be sitting and
now again same thing may happen here we can see that this will come here and this may come here so we have to find out the resultant here
from 3 make an arc which will be at p3
the idea is to get as many bytes as possible from this secret key, the first think to note is that there 16 such bytes over here and therefore we would obtain a key size of 128 bits, the hope is that when we run this attack we would be able to reduce this uncertainty about the key to a significant level
then you will understand alright
if it happens, if lightning hits at tower top; suppose it lightning; this is a very common phenomena, if lightning hits a tower top
so let us say reactive power we want to measure in a three phase balanced system
that is a common semantics
so, this are this is a you know little bit coming to this problem diagram, little bit you do it and just see that only that little bit understanding is required
there is no the rho part of it has been absorbed as a delta function and it is become a pure surface that ok
for this paragraph i think this much is sufficient
now detailed routing will just assign the exact horizontal and vertical metal layers for these routes
we can guess from the position of legs and feet of their mental situations while they are talking to someone or before participation in a conversation midway
for each of these, we will try to write down an outline of a class description and then we will see that given that, these phones have certain inherent hierarchy of specialization, how do we combine this code into a c++ inheritance hierarchy and how does that simplify the total model
so, let us see this happening in practice, so note at the objdump that we have obtained is from the compiler
now we have placed the strand on the machine for the testing, once the strand is fixed preload is applied to keep the strands straight
so now, switch is closed for long time
welcome to module 19 of programming in c++
we shall come to these issues later
then we apply this sequence of bits one zero, zero, zero one to the l f s, r and, depending on the feedback, some of the bits will get modified accordingly
if you look at, you know mixer grinder, without motor, it will not work
so, usually for good microwave matching, we require vswr of less than 2
now to give you an overview of how this looks
so, voltage is nothing but 3i that is 3 multiplied by the value of current i that come out to be 15cos60 pi t
so, if you write v, v is equal to is equal to i into req, right so, things are understandable , right so, just hold on
this is also possible for class and i show that it is actually possible that if i have more than one parameter then i can partially specialize those parameters, so that is what i am trying to illustrate here
so, fixing delta x is good enough delta t will get fixed according to the courant ok
so this interconnection modeling, we shall be looking basically into these issues
now we have represent this stack by this particular diagram, so we have a frame pointer, pointing to a location in the stack and we have a stack pointer, pointing lower down in the stack, every time we push something onto this stack, the stack pointer address reduces as we keep pushing into the stack
so, all that i have is a class, it is some this class does not do anything very meaningful, it is called by my class and it has ordinary data member here int x
no, but we are exciting into the wideband, but i am not getting frequency information in my fdtss output is what e as a function of space and time below frequency
therefore in rotational motion and if you say rectilinear, cartesian xy emotion in one direction
that means, this one can be written as r 2 dash plus you take r 2 dash common it will be one upon s minus one right
the second one will use the copy constructor because it takes the c 1 object which is a complex object and uses the copy constructor to construct c 2
let us talk about first the electric circuit
so i should be able to write in this case also doh wf divided by doh x, where i am going to have minus of doh wf of course
so i will not have any net starting torque because of which i will not have this machine so single phase induction motor is inherently not self starting
so, when you take the equivalent of this let me let me let me got through that let me go through that, therefore the tau is equal to i told you r eq is equal to 1 ohm and tau is equal to 0
similarly, there is test kind of a comparison
and, similarly at background there might be a shape which is passing through that which is not directly visible from this isometric view
as this passes through and finally reaches the output this particular byte of the output is either s[p] + k0 or, s[p + f] + k0
so when i say that i am scaling up or scaling down a gate, i am making a gate bigger or smaller
so it will be clearly, you know step down, but here if i leave it as an open circuit, the voltage induced will be enormously high, so i can never leave the current transformer as an open circuit instead i should connect a small resistance, how small is small that depends upon again the per unit, if you calculate what is the base impedance, compared to base impedance make it really, really small
and during the integrator and differentiator i told you that they can be used as a filter
so, the point is that in case of e beam evaporators we cannot use unfortunately in mosfet because this x rays will damage your dielectrics, this x ray will damage your substrate and this may lead to the trapped charges alright
159; then z phi p i a upon a 7, this is the 1 upon 2 pi you make it right this is 0
so, the higher voltage that is being generated will be corresponding to may be about 40 or 50 v
the actual cost of the labor is again we have to calculate like skilled first of all skilled then we have to calculate the semi skilled and then we have to calculate the unskilled
so, now for every quarter for every business, when this kind of the budget is ready, it remains communicated to the different sections, subsections, units and subunits in the organization
bhf why, because bhf is sio2 etchant
so this gives us a certain geometry to work with and an effect of the local effect of a global mechanism itself
that is an example of intangible asset
so, if you draw a horizontal line and this one is this is again this one is again theta right
is it engineering, is it science, is it math
4 and i is equal to your dq by dt that is from equation 1
so, you might have to make sure that adequate cooling is being done
so, that will always mean the name in the global scope
so, we assume that whatever is cash generated is in the form of profit
we move to the next program, where we are illustrating a very simple arithmetic program, which has two variables, a and b and adds them to generate their sum
so in this way the buck, the boost and the buck boost are now replaced with practical realizable power semiconductor switches which can now be simulated and even implemented in hardware
so, so this is, on this graph sheet, so go ahead construct all the way down
now if it is an unreinforced wall, you are going to have one single crack that propagates and becomes the surface on which the sliding is going to occur and can dissipate a limited amount of energy
one is a stuck at one
so, this is i have written for you recall that inductors act like short circuit short circuit to dc right
the prototype of it is a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and mania
so normally we write the apparent power expression s as either vi conjugate, iv conjugate and so on
so, if you were to draw the energy band diagram for this under reverse bias, have my pi have intrinsic i have n
okay the next thing we need is the address of the string /bin/sh, we could also use the string/bin/bash which is a pointer, which is a string comprising of the bash executable but making it work that we would be a little more difficult, on the other hand we actually use and create a sh shell that is /bin/sh and we need to find somewhere in the entire process, where /bin/sh is present, so we do is we try to search in the various paths of this process memory
so, that's what we were looking at in the last class
so, we have got this information that the beginning balance or you can call it as closing balance of the month of may is or of the previous quarter is now the opening balance in the month of june which is the first month of the current quarter so we will have to take it as the opening balance
y y
you should not click anything just move your mouse
now we have to do the analysis for this circuit
if you have circuit with all independent sources set equal to zero and the keeping all the dependent sources connected with the network the terminal a and b would be supplied with voltage v naught which will supply some current i naught
you have to analyze the circuit by creating a super mesh, super mesh means
now, so to start this one, right, , let us first see each section, and then we see what is the role of this particular dc power supply is;
so, distribution of line of flux in a motor due to magnetic field only right, but conductors carrying no current
now we will do the same thing for the capacitors, coupling capacitors c1 and c2
but just for the benefit of non commerce people, i am not using the terminology journal entry, but in the same way actually journal entries are derived
and if we know the two protocols, the priority inheritance protocol and the highest locker protocol, then it will become very easy to understand the working of the priority sealing protocol
86 something
and when you are done naturally you have created this object, so the responsibility is with you to destroy the object and therefore, you can call the destructor and destroy that object
so, the tangential component is being only is only being given by that one component
4 or 0
5 hours, nothing more than that, transformers is a vast topic, so inclusive of three phase transformer i may be requiring in about 8
so, calculation of power using complex notation now now onwards
from a psychological point of view, in some situations smile and laughter are defensive mechanisms, it is why distinguishing a fake smile from a genuine one is important if you want to understand people and their emotions
it will go for the next size and once it has found the proper value it lost value to put it into a file so let me say i'll put it into test and save a test dot mgo it's created also flashes onto the screen the various results so if you double click on this test or i will click with g eddit, okay, so it will give forward converter specifications
you can show the where you have reached the frequency, about place 1
so let us see the problem that let us say that this part of the boundary over here is made out of this green part
now, there are many instances of taking the research from the lab to the market and some of these are being done very professionally by professors who have been instrumental from taking the research from the labs to create great companies
and power factor your for ab 6 upon root over 6 square plus 8 square, it is 0
thirty three is the delay
so, the first mode the second mode and the third mode and these are again gif files produced
so now this gives the designer a tool to play around
so, let us go ahead so let us look at the motivation over here
you may also ask this is plus minus v supply, but here i have drawn it as positive and 0 let us keep that question also aside
now when we talk about depletion type mosfet, the channel is already there in the beginning, when you talk about enhancement type mosfet there is no channel between source and drain
you have a function in the base class which you want to overload in the derived class
ah, in the earlier lectures we talked about various timing issues where you do static analysis of a circuit to identify false paths and so on, so that some timing related constraints can be satisfied and if there are violations, some measures can be taken
so then what will do the total pu will be total pu on the splice plate will be pu1 plus pu2
yeah, so in our class what i have seen some of the students in class writing in a certain way for languages and for actual notes
so, it will be minus 6 , then here it is your what you call plus ah your voltage i am not mark
the company plans to buy some new fixtures by or for $3,000 in cash in the month of march
and if that fails the whole structure collapses
now i know b inside is zero and this should be equal to b applied plus b induced due to whatever m is, since b applied is uniform
so, it will be minus v 2 either this way or this way
so, after a while he noticed that his ship got slower and much tougher to handle inspite of the fact that his copper was protected very well
let us first give it a name vin
﻿ and welcome to this lecture so this is the demo in the course for in secure systems engineering
the total deflection, the mid span deflection of the wall itself is delta not
winding time, it will be (())(36:14) see, we are essentially trying to make sure that the winding current should not exceed the rated value, that is all
i which is 5, q pointer d is 7
this is a photograph of some records of how the accounting was made in the old period
the other possibilities are like this, where you convert and you are trying to pass an array, but the actual function needed a pointer
this how that sinusoidal ah representation of an sinusoidal signal by a phasor; that means, phasor actually phasor is a rotating vector, right
so, sale 000 plus 2 000 4,000 is the inflow for the year getting it okay next is purchase of in equipment if you go to balance sheet there was equipment 21 000 increasing 55,600 so 34,600 of increase
these are all going to mature or which are going to be liquidated or converted within a period of one year
so, first it is encountering minus ah terminal the 40 volt source ; that means, it will be around writing here later will come to that it will be minus 40, right then this when your moving clock wise it is encountering plus terminal first
there are sixteen points, just like the way i talked about
what we are assuming is that the current drawn by inverting or non inverting terminals is 0
so, therefore to determine the thevenin or norton's equivalent circuit we need to only find them with the help of a circuit analysis technique that may be the mesh analysis or a nodal analysis
this gives us an estimate of the steel stress and the steel stress is in this case 228
sometimes you shall only say that there is a fault on the mother board of your p c, but where is the mother board that it does not say ok
so, split takes a string s and takes a character or actually could be any string and it splits the columns it gives you a list of values that come by taking the parts between the commas
so, what i like to do is; i like to just be gentle and soft and hopefully they will feel better about themselves
at this point 11 is bigger than 10
so, this is due to the non zero resistance of the coil of the meter ok
this is, savitha’s applications is now quite processing students function in app 1 namespace; for niloy, that is in the app 2 namespace
that when i have input voltage is equal to 0 equal to 0, i see that there is a presence of output voltage there is a presence of output voltage
now, with some suitable scaling of the various arms of the circulator that is by scaling the arms and we might change the phase relationships at the different ports
so, how many points should i tested
so, we get n 2 which is the career concentration temperature equal to 600 is 1
so when we use the unit impulse response what we have to do we apply the correct division principle in s domain and find the value of i naught so let us first convert this circuit into s domain
run time inefficiency
all we have is a capacitor c2 and rd and rl
so, anywhere we move in this coordinate plane they will remain perpendicular in relation
internal standard has the advantage that the standard pattern and the unknown pattern are correct, collected under exactly the same conditions
whereas, for a preparation of a chemical substance, you will find examples or example 1, 2, how this is prepared, the different methods by which it can be prepared and if there is a disadvantage in a particular method that advantage is described
now we talk about the standard cost and budgets
so, here directly below this north pole force, here will be in this direction so, this is the force
coming back to this slide, in the picture on the right, i have showed the same shaft
or you can give some kind of delay budgets if you can specify some upper bound of the delay
the duration for which the touch is there are to be studied as a part of this body linguistic aspect
5 degree plus j 38
so, we have learnt in c++, in c we cannot write the swap this way
now, when we talk about data transfer there are options
so we all want to predict the expansion depending on the phase completion
as the final example
using objdump can be also obtained with gdb
so let us start, first understand, what is the convolution integral
similarly, for phase c 100 angle minus 120 divided by 6 minus j 8
so this sink which has the least timing slack, we identify that sink as the critical sink
this is something which comes to the practice and by looking at more examples hopefully the procedure become clearer, but the key thing to dynamic programming is to be able to understand the inductive structure
the other terms it is not very clear how they will get simplified ok, so, let us let us see how they will
if i provide excessive amount of flux, then i might have to return some portion of the magnetising current in one sense, which means it is going to work like a capacitor, if i provide just sufficient amount of flux
if we look at the numbers for india alone, it is projected that in 2050 we will be producing or we will be needing anything from 800 million tons to about 1300 million tons of cement
now gamma in equal to 0 means z in minus z 0 equal to 0 implies z in should be equal to z 0
so, we need to now apply this divergence theorem to region 1 over here ok
remember, the range was stopped at 4 because 5 is the upper bound and this sequence will be converted to a list by the function list
one small thing to be aware of when we are dealing with prime numbers is that we should not accidentally define 1 to be a prime, because if you just look at this definition that the only factors are 1 and itself, it is a bit ambiguous because 1 is a factor and itself 1 is also a factor
now, we'll just have a look at the lifo method
that is potential due to this, plus these small, small charges
another way of writing this is that it is iphe and the flux of the photons is depends upon the power of the incident radiation and the energy
and in this particular circuit, vds0 and vgs0 are exactly the same
so, in this case it runs in the direc[tion] stator field that acquires a steady speed of n; obviously, n less than ns
minus x 4 plus u write or x 4 dot is equal to minus x 1 upon r t g minus 1 upon t g x 4 plus 1 upon t g u write; this is actually your equation number 15 this is equation 15 that is x 4 dot minus 1 upon r t g x 1 minus 1 upon t g x 4 plus 1 upon t g u; this is equation 15
so, we call this what this is given a name is call the state equation because it tells something about the state of the domain and if i am if i if you give me x i can solve for u right i can take u common from the left hand side i will get identity minus g d x which i have to invert and get the electric field right
numerical 4 is normally the posture which people are advised to avoid during formal situations
so, before going into the rc circuit particularly, let us understand what is the meaning of first order circuit, so what we will do in the first order circuit, we will discuss about two types of simple circuits which are comprising of a resistor and capacitor and a circuit which is comprising of a resistor and inductor, so these are typically called as rc and rl circuits
therefore we will not make the connection here
so you pick up trail lines of level zero
so, the revenue it generates from services plus the revenue it generates from sales both together
and if you want to find out the ratio of these 2 quantities, then there is a simpler method and that is called the signal flow graph method
i am going to have a north pole and south pole which is actually created either with the help of the permanent magnet or because of the current flowing through the rotor windings
we will select some geometrical circular geometry or geometry with curved
instead of twelve we had been able to work with a clock period of ten, right, ok, so let us come back
the reason for the cracking is the formation of the ettringite inside your c s h just like what we discussed earlier, for ettringite to be expansive it has to imbibe water by forming in the microcrystalline in size scale within your c s h and that is basically imbibing moisture and increasing in size leading to cracking and once that cracking happens there is sufficient space now for the ettringite to grow and recrystallize, you have now sufficient space for that to happen
so, when you are trying to screw this reynolds ah pen the blue color part, if the thread is too small it immediately loses that pen and the functionality of the part severely affects
the next question is how to draw tangent a normal to a spiral
6 volt right
one was to go through yourself, the second was through observation
5 weber
i can take cosine theta one and cosine theta two to be one and therefore the horizontal components cancel and they give you zero because the component for the blue one is towards a right and component for the red one is towards the left
so, now the unknowns over here i can call it u 2 right
in a nested dictionaries, we have two keys dhawan and kohli with scores 76 and 200 as the values
so is; that means, k is equal to you know that phi 1 2 upon phi 1, phi 1 is the total flux and phi 1 2 is the flux linking the other coil
if the rotor is rotating at synchronous speed, you are not going to see the damper having any induced emf at all; they are not going to see any relative velocity
so, let us actually look at it, it will be a little bit more quantitatively ok
isn’t it, which is funny
so this longest path which apparently will show up in your direct a cyclic graph of four hundred is never exercised
we have already calculated and that works out as rupees 6,800
so, you can ask me query i will get back to you with a proper solution so that we are all on same page
500 units are already there with us in the warehouse and some raw material is also already available with us in the godown
you can make it at the end of the period, at the end of three months or at the end of one month
when q1 is on the flux is pushed to one side and when q2 is on the flux is pushed to the other side
then, whatever the thing we are going to observe that we call top view
so we have at last come to the end of this twelfth week long course on vlsi physical design
so, these values of the effective mass depend upon the band structure fine
that pin, if activated, will cause the chip to start the testing and that will happen internally only, with no external intervention and once the testing is over, there will be a output pin saying good or bad
if you look at most of the machines, they are all made up of ferromagnetic material
one thing i want you to realise is if slip is positive means omega r is less than omega s
as i mentioned, drawing sheet involves a drawing space, few border lines, and a title block; longer side always be in horizontal direction, shorter side always be in the vertical direction
similarly, for the current let us say the current source is i naught multiplied by unit step function
i would only get the total value, so i may call this as r equivalent
now if there are 2 sources voltage sources if you see in this particular circuit you have 2 sources one is voltage source other is current source
the most frequent way in which we generate boolean values is through comparisons we have already seen the two of these
there are two types of photoresists
similarly all other tasks they lock their resources
so, for that purpose, what we have to do first of all keep it in isometric view
so, it is if i put more sensors over there, i am not going to get more information; it is like over sampling a band limited field
so how do we design an oscillator
now, go to features revolve boss base around this axis we would like to have which is automatically selected as line 1, because the first line what we have constructed is that centre line
all manufacturers they are say fighting with each other they have to face the competition and if they are not able to take the help of the technology reduce the cost of production then certainly the customers would reject their product or the service
this is also there
so, i will write it out and then we will see what its properties are
5 micro farad right; so and it is given v t is equal to 0 volt for t less than equal to 0, it is you make less than 0 less than less than right
here before the data members, there is a keyword public on the left hand side and there is a keyword private on the right hand side
probably the list of tasks that would happens before the activity, right
2 lakhs or 1
we may be requiring coolterm to see the sensor outputs
then you go into something called physical design, where you translate these into the final transistor level layout which is now ready for fabrication or manufacturing
ok, these are the three points, more or less the profile followed by the um, ma change in magnetic field also sort of mimics the change in ah, actual temperature, ah, um of the of the bearing
so, look at compare 3 and 1 what is the right hand side of these two equations
the circuit is a magnitude comparator
similarly, the second one has z, which is distance plus v t
so toy motors or we may use this normally in hair dryer in those cases, we may be using this kind of shaded pole configuration
but disadvantage is that the fault lists can grow unpredictably, so memory requirements is typically much higher and also the set theoretic rules in terms of computing is a little difficult and the set theoretic rules are possible for many block
textbook, notebook, file manager, settings, pretty big, download, upload
there is a battery, this is plus symbol, minus symbol and this is your 2 terminals are mark 1 and 2 right and this is your say tungsten lamp, this is a lamp and when you take the 4 ampere current says flowing say 4 ampere current is flowing
in fact it becomes easier if we represent the entire microwave device with its various ports using single flow graph
if it is logarithmic scale then we must write down it is log; if it is not, it will write down as hertz; bandwidth is f h minus f l this is your central frequency
to look at the difference between the priority inheritance protocol and the priority sealing protocol, the priority inheritance protocol is a greedy approach
so, the compiler cannot see any v 2 2 symbol in this code and the compiler will treat this as undefined
sharma from the department of management studies, i
and, you see all high values of r x that in a very small region within this 25 percent of the scale we have everything from 3 kilo ohm to infinite
so, as i am moving in the direction this way, that component of m is increasing and divergence of m is not zero
but we see that when you use a retarder, right the csa with the retarder, you can reduce this slump loss, right
and when you will be reflected here 0
that is the area which is representing the electrical energy input during this particular duration of the movement complete movement that has taken place
so it is higher again you can say this is rupees
one very important task of the designers, or you can say the text engineers, was to ensure that the chip does not contain any apparent fabrication defects
this is something that is a landmark introduction as far as our code is concerned in 2016, which means in zones even of moderate seismic activity such as low to moderate seismic activity such as chennai, we cannot design unreinforced masonry
so, b is business is actually more profitable than that of a
now in this case this is a variable resistance whenever cutting an arrow through it, right
so, when i want to conduct a open circuit characteristic test, i have to necessarily apply 220 volts and if i am applying 220 volts to a 0
you could discretize it
and finally the third regime is where the object size is much larger than the wavelength
so, there is the simple way to rewrite this
either a space in the corner and prefer, preferred to keep the incubator which will be holding all you cells all your experimental material see for example, this is the incubator preferred to keep it as far away as possible from the main gate and
and, if i now change the direction of the current then we will immediately see that the direction of torque and force will get reversed
from there i can move that file into the required, into my required, so this would be upload and this would be download, we also need to create the prototype for our system like dc++ our repository where the download and uploads of the admin would be
so we have to join in such way that cg of each members pass through a particular point, otherwise eccentricity may develop
so, this is my 3 upon omega s then i 2 dash square from this expression you substitute here you substitute here into your r 2 dash by s
add any other point
so that we never default in making the payment and to say schedule the payment properly all the payments properly and regularly and make the payment on the due date without any kind of default
so, with that kind of lettering style, we can go ahead and draw sketches and represent them
these two things we have paid
pozzolanic materials can be beneficial in def, why
so this is my three phase induction motor, so i have just connected it like this, so these are the three phase supplies a b c
now, to make this whole math a little bit easier, i am going to define a new auxiliary variable ok
so, in that case what will happen current actually leaving the dot right
so, i this is a strange phenomena with this mobile in app and with whatsapp and all that; we know these things are happening in the society
so, the field is so, mom in general does not tell you which one to do
what will mean that, if i write c out, it will also check if std namespace has a c out; it does have one
construct a rectangle, done
12 and p of e is 0
so, how do we understand the difference between these 2
she is going to show you where the sensor is and then she is going to wave in front of it and let see what actually happens on the oscilloscope
2ze fy by gamma m0 okay so this will become 1
so, often in e learning courses and online learning, there is an entry survey you would have encountered that even in this course it may be about demographics, it may be about background, personal interests why do you enrol in this course
we said that here, especially the inner ear, which has the fluid filled in the cochlea, has the nerve endings and because the repulse that are created, it takes a little longer time to settle down
if the line is not properly protected against such over voltage, such voltage makes it the line to ground fault withstand voltage
in terms of g we again also i have not done anything, but in terms of f i have done something interesting; what i have done
and also there is additional sensitivity to something else
so it will be dissipated in the form of heat there
the charge distribution rho right
so, let me come to the load cases, calculations of the load cases and the combinations thereof
so in the probe phase which is again this for loop being executed the victim would start to access every cache set and in the probe phase the victim would parse through every cache set and access all the cache lines present in that particular set and at that time it would also measure the time required to make these accesses
so, implications is that if i have a very high bandwidth current source, space discretization must be very fine right it sounds counter it sounds like what is the relation, but you can see the relation is via the courant parameter right space discretization
the true value of the voltage at this moment was possibly 3
this involves strategy 1 which is predict outcome where during the activity phase the students predict the outcome of a phenomenon which was shown to them in the visualization
so, on expected lines i have got some vector with a x component or y component and no z component right, that is what we expect
now suppose i have an pmmc meter with fsd current equals say 10 milliampere and say the internal resistance of the coil is also known to be say take it 99 ohm as an example ok
so, the 25 point when we are rotating it by 90 degrees it always goes to up
so, basically it will be 725
in a very crude way to answer this particular question, the dc would have 0 frequency while ac you can change the frequency
if you have two or more locations you can actually take an average of these values and you have valuable information coming from the structure itself
if you want to read more details, these are the accounting standards on the basis of which cash flows are made
so, though it is, it could be a fixer set, right now since it's held for sale, it should be marked as a ca
so only in linear system this is going to be true
we have discussed the basic concept of reference, and using that we have introduced the notion of call by reference
channel one is yellow color, channel 2 is blue color, right
yeah, and
they mainly include the owners, the prospective owners that is investors who want to invest in the company
let us take for example the library, the libc library
so, these are some of the ics or a schematic that i have used
but unfortunately the c language does not provide in a built in support in the language for doing handling all these you know unhappy paths, all these error paths and a synchronous, asynchronous the error introduce you to logical reasons the error introduce you to system configurations and all that
i have an original b t which i will call b zero t
if you turn back to mqtt again, go back and look at what mqtt does
instead of showing this dimension line double arrows thing one can also show it by a single arrow, a leader line with phi 7
there are other applications as well, but we have considered coolterm in this particular lecture
but to be honest what are the materials is there that can fulfill those
so the current has changed
hello, everybody, we continue our services marketing with a practical approach
so, if i know the ratio; then the differential amplifier can reject the common mode signal by that ratio called cmrr; common mode rejection ratio, it is given by mod of ad by acm; differential gain divided by common mode gain
if you see this particular circuit then you will see that this 5 ohm is cutting across
so, for node p if you apply kirchhoff current law and if you see the mesh current is i 2 which is going in to node p and the mesh current i 2 is coming out of node p and another current source of 5 ampere is coming out of node p, so what you can write
there is also a negative impact and if you think what are the things that could affect the economy negatively arising from concrete, one thing that pops up is poor construction
we have to evaluate the criterion for c3 to behave like a short circuit that we will do later
and again, for that matter binary search in c++ is very often used and nobody will write a programme for doing a binary search for any type of data container that someone has
h z was 0 right; so, i had e z
general conclusions clinkerization as expected and we have shown you numbers of how much it dominates the impact of cement and concrete more clinker worse for the environment in terms of co2 emission and energy
so, i infinity is there, i infinity is there and here instead of e to the power t by tau here, it will be e to the power minus t minus t 0 by tau right
to keep it to make this move we have to right click this the object, we earned we can click on float
but what it has done is using those three points optimize the equations to fix the center
so the output is getting stabilized only after delay of three and not two
so, when the linear system is described by higher order differential equations the state diagram can be constructed from these equations
now there is one small aspect which i want to discuss that is the freewheeling aspect and the flux within the core
if we compute the utilization due to the three tasks, we find that it is 40 by 60 or 11 by 15 which is of course meets the basic criterion that the utilization is less than one
but these becomes more and more important as we talk about using cell based biosensors we talked about using microfluidic devices cell based microfluidic devices we talked about you know lab on a chip
50 or the existing level of the gross current assets which is existing means maintained by the firm that can be brought down to the level of 1
so, this term is not there
so, what is the physical interpretation now
e represents the electric field, h represents the magnetic field
so, you can imagine there is some book keeping to be little bit careful about how you are numbering things fine
so, now, these are all so this is in the frequency domain
now, when you do that either it will automatically select the parts whatever we have constructed in a specific directory
so, the any object whatever the projection we would like to really consider that has to be in between vertical plane, horizontal plane and auxiliary plane or auxiliary vertical plane
and the last item given over here is salvage value
ohm’s law right so, ohm’s law right
so, we start with 1 and 2, and then we divide 1 and 2, and rearrange the terms to get the expression for the fermi level position in an extrinsic n type semiconductor with respect to the fermi level position in an intrinsic semiconductor
so, now let's see the remaining parts of cost benefit analysis
if you look bc and bn, 30 degree
so, you could find out the mutual coupling by solving the problem without element b you get some impedance right
so, this is what we discussed in the last class and then we stabilized that thevenin voltage is nothing but open circuit voltage across the linear two terminal circuit and r th is nothing but the input resistance at the terminal when independent sources are turned off
so split ring and brush arrangement works like a rectifier it essentially is converting the alternating current in the conductors of the armature in a dc machine to dc
so, have a closer look at the screen and what you see
this is the access of time and here we show the instantaneous power consumption, which means the, the product of the current and the voltage
it requires that the response to a sum of the input right is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately
in our entire course, for these nptel online lectures, we go with first angle system
for the bottom also bottom view from p if we are dropping a perpendicular line is going to intersect the first line at this point locate that first point p1
now, after the operating budget, financial budgets, and in the first part of the financial budget is the cash budget
so, the advantage of these are these take very small code space, very little storage, the code size is small and even the temporary storage requirement is very small
you multiply the two numbers r2, r3 and you take only 32 bits of the result because multiplication result can be 64 bit, but you ignore the high order bits you assume that the result will fit within 32 bits and you take only the last 32 bits
so, this is this way you can make it
so the last buffer will be driving, driving a set of clock pins, clock terminals
in the next class, we will start talking about the next topic that is the budgets and the budgetary control
so, another generic term because if you see the generic term in the literature you will see that it is given like vt is equal to vm sine omega t plus 5
it would be like a wiki for notes
how do you increase a voltage
two versions have come mmpi one and recently you will find mmpi two being used
so, here at this point the v p minus v n is 2 volt, then also the output is same plus v supply here say here this value is 4 volt so; that means, v p is 4 volt more than v n, then also the output is plus v supply
again, let us look at what is positive, what has concrete bring that is the positive impact to the economy
so i minus minus i plus delta i that what it should have been
so the way to so the condition for oscillation was given by that equation which was shown previously
so, v 1 is equal to 10 into i 2, but we are taking directly directly, this v 1 like this, right
so, what about this x coordinate, y coordinate
first, transformer what it will transformer do
so, that is omega into t 2 pi
next one is that you have contro; i hope this droop characteristic why why do they why do they use that droop characteristic for each governor i think it is it is now understandable understandable to you, instead of instead of isochronous governor right and those mechanism
then for each of these we calculate, as i had shown, the mean and connect them and you go recursively
i have cleaned up dc dc there is nothing else
we have basically exchanged these two statements
so they can be no maximum or minimum
so, we will distribute 10,000 by 5, that is 2,000 each year and make a provision for depreciation every year
so, i leave it at that when we actually take a concrete 1 d problem you will see which one to do both are correct yes ok
but again manufacturing the product and keeping it in the warehouse is not the purpose
tthe part of the signal across the capacitor c 2 right or this one is is fed to the inverting amplifier
give them you know their put, put their names up as leaders or you just give them achievement
this is the overall pseudo code of this simulated annealing process or algorithm
do you remember that item
remember everything all this entire discussion that is happening about the shape functions are limited to the interior of this or the element, this triangle not outside the triangle
and, this is my interval a comma b, this is f of x then what is it say
so this is the buck converter you are familiar with the circuit by now we need to rate the components the switch the diode the inductance and the capacitance these are the four elements that we need to design to design this to rate the components properly we need to have an understanding of the various waveforms that are pretty critical
it was darwin who had initiated is studied in what can be understood is the signs of a smiling
now this also gives you a very good motivation for studying analysis methods of nonlinear circuits and understand them properly and so on
so what we can learn from proton nmr, really we can say this is you know representing best the reality
i am sure you remember what is known as substitution theorem from basic electrical circuits
so, what operations are allowed depend on the values and this is given technically the name type
the theoretical approach felt that these conventional cues helped us in registering a social presence that is associated with certain levels of association
with this basic information about memory, let us understand what actually we are going to do as part of this very discussion, deliberation for this full week
so, after simplification you will get it is 10 sin omega t plus 8
33 times 10 to the 24 per meter cube
it gives extra power to the customer to look for the best supplier, means the company who can fulfill its requirement in the best possible manner, they can supply them the best product at the very competitive price
now, when u apply voltage v across the plates of the capacitor a charge q is deposited on 1 plate of the capacitor and charge minus q is deposited on the other plate of the capacitor
based on the chip size the ics can be classified or integrated circuits can be classified as follows
the following can cause this offset
so once we have decided which system we have to now go to a plant because in india and in many other emerging countries we do not have databases that are ready to use
remember the whole idea of using constant current biasing was to reduce the sensitivity of the transconductance to the parameters of the transistor such as the threshold voltage and current factor
if you are using this circuit, whatever this flip flop, you are never supposed to give input as 1 and 1
these are the two concerns we will have for any system, which is not really going to be running on a continuous basis
so, is not it very similar to the short circuit test of a transformer that is why the block rotor test is also known as short circuit test of the induction motor
so, for example, when i took the 1 d line segment over here this had 2 shape functions right
so, this is a non inverting amplifier, where a fraction of the output voltage v o, a fraction of the output voltage is fed back to the inverting terminal or minus terminal and here you give the input call it v i
in the opinion of simon bronner, these tactual metaphors suggest is certain level of truth and a clarity of perception
wood is an insulator
it is not one single parameter that affects the r factor, but several factors that can affect the number itself
because all this is happening and so, much is happening right from birth till about you become an adult, that changes are many
so, we totally opposed the anodic reaction with enough current and now we get zero corrosion
from top view is supposed to make this slot here, the slot here we are going to see, but on top view we are seeing something like a circle
nlp encourages us to look at models instead of looking at role models
ok, so in our next lecture that will follow, we shall be looking at the other processes of testing, like test generation, design for test ability, etcetera
so it means credit sales made during the month of january, they will be collectible till the end of the february
if a higher priority task is using a resource, the lower priority task need to wait
and i can create similar kind of get set idiom with the static data member static member function and the static data members that we have
so, this is these are flux lines and the thumb is the direction of the force
06 whatever 0
and how can calculate the i b, there were some formulas given in a table
then we will ask the integration e over e c e r w of r prime right
so, we will get the average price
so, creativity which would include the developmental motivational affective and the cognitive processes whereas, the art part which would be including aesthetic content form and function how audience responds to such type of arts in terms of their preferences, in terms of the judgment of those artistic out comes, this is what psychology and the art does
so, it is ab c or a b c all are marked; so, a to be actually here it is r c right and here it is your this branch is ra for delta and this branch is rb for this thing right
so, what does this comparator do
so, finally, that voltage e also will reduce and the current also will reduce or diminished right
again i will compare this in terms of time constant
see, this equation may look a little complex, but the way they have been obtained are pretty simple
so, at 70 mm this supposed to be some kind of line goes in that direction and from here there is 70 mm
to calculate the energy lost or the power lost to thermalization we worse need to calculate the number of photons, this is again ihc/λ which gives you the number of photons
any technical support that they require, if licenses are getting expired or if sometimes people leave the company or new people joining, licenses need to be transferred, all of this admin stuff it takes time it is going to affect your time
only thing is that in the assignment another thing you have to do very seriously and ah good good problems will be given in the assignment and just your job will be to your what you call to solve those things right and ah compare to the your past system analysis course where also heavy competition was there
now, the projection if we are drawing this entire pentagon in this view front view if we are looking from that this line coincides with that one edge as a surface
the following information has been obtained from the records of left central corporation for the period from december 1 to december 31 2017
the project as defined in the pmbok, project manager's book of knowledge, fifth edition
like in this case if you see, there are only 2 variables related to mesh current
now that we have at least seen what is the difference between the structure in terms of its winding for a transformer and for an induction motor or synchronous machine
so this remained unsolved for a 100 years till this whole copper thing vanished from the ship industry and suddenly there were pipelines and those are all made of cast iron or iron rather iron
should have your voltage source that you originally had
and, then because i am putting you in a different situation which you are not able to fit in, this makes me register a complaint in the parent teachers meet these many problems
so, if we are projecting some point this one we have to project to that point and we are rotating it in that direction it comes all the way there and this p point projected to there that comes to that point onto the auxiliary plane and from there it goes parallel to that line
we will start increasing the frequency with the step of 20 hertz
wip means work in process add it up up here, put a line here, show the total amount here and write less
this is given in table 20, tables 20 of is 800 and in clause 1043 it is described
so, in this case what we can say
similarly, at omega 2 z 2 will be root over2 root 2 r and will be 45 degree right therefore, at omega 1 i 1 will be that a angle 0 this is the voltage reference right divided by your impedance root 2 r angle minus 45 degree that will become v upon root 2 r and angle 45 degree right
but some of the operators in the infix also could be a prefix position or post fix positions
this thing you have to keep it in your mind right
so, you can provide such a thing by adding a string as an argument to the input
the cut off frequency here when we calculate it is 159
so, if yellow is channel one and blue is channel 2 excellent
so finally you achieve a set of knowledge is transmitted to you and you are suppose to learn it
so for now, let us stop here, thank you
if it is 2 percent and slip is 2 percent that f is 50 hertz
now, we would like to make a circular disc
now in set notation if you draw the when diagram you can easily prove that l a intersection l b bar is nothing but l a minus l b said difference
so, let us take a rope of fixed length l, tie it on one side of the cylinder, now spin the cylinder
it is very, very interesting from that point of view because you can do it routinely on different samples
so, the question is what happens, if we swap the inverting and non inverting terminals plus and minus inputs, in an non this is a this is inverting amplifier
if the credit purchase is not possible to be taken then you take the total purchases and then is you take care is the average accounts payable right
which he attached to depress complex basically he said that the male child having now maximum fascination for the mother realizes that there could be situation when he, private part could be castrated and this is source of anxiety according freud
after spin coating the photoresist you have to soft bake the same
now, let me clear it so similarly, when your t greater than t 0 u t minus t 0 is equal to 1; that means, this one will be v 0 right
secondly, the observers preexisting bias it might also influence the inference that one is drawing
so, it is very easy, right
what i did was i took the drain voltage fed it to one of the inputs of the op amp and drive the source with the output of the op amp
are the primary and secondary impedances always comparable
so, the crucible susceptor is heated at very high temperature and crucible gets heated and then there is a thermal shield here
we said that f divided by p by 2 is going to be the revolutions per second or i would say 2 f by p is the revolutions per second or i can say 120 f by p, many of the books say this
the practical op amps have input currents which are extremely small order of minus 6 minus 14 ampere, right
now let's look at the spiral model
before i make the coupling coefficients i need to create efficient data structures to store of all these elements rights so, this is creating
first order polynomial, how many roots or zeros you call it zeros how many roots does it have
so, this is c v x t 1 right
so, what is interesting and new in this whole scenario is this piece of the code in the initialization list
so what have we discussed till now, we have tried to understand the process of memory we have tried to succinctly no understand the process of forgetting
the second thing is notice that this one equation has inbuilt into it information about the entire problem not just the differential equation, but the boundary conditions also how is that
i have added the tid subcircule
so normally what is done is there will be a comparator and to the comparator arms let's say you have plus and minus you will give a triangle generator here and this is where the comparison input or the control voltage is coming and this will get compared with the triangle so if i'm having a triangle which is from minus 1 to plus 1 with 0 in between and let us say my control voltage vc cuts in like this so you could in effect how your pulse with modulation which goes like this and so on so it will compare with this control voltage and if the triangle is greater than the control voltage, you will get a high pulse
so, per process you could have one or more enclaves or you could also have a process without any enclaves as well
so the basic idea is that the process is continued till, let say, each of the partition sub circuit is single gate which has a unique place on the layout area
so in this case there are two possible options
if va is a dc bias, vb is the signal
now you can connect whatever resistance you want between this
so this is typical of the lossy fluxer is set and this exponential decay is the lm by r time constant and this is due to the decay in the magnetizing current
so you can think of applying quadrature rule over here
all you need to do is send in an entry with your motivation on why you want to be part of this workshop and what is it that really want to be solving it
so, it means what will be the cost to the payer to the electric circuit means the total cost or you can call it as the net % value of the payments the electric circuit is making to the general electric
if someone’s body is turned towards you, but one or both feet are not the person does not want to be with you; one or both feet point at something the person is interested in
you can go through the design equations which is an m file and you can probably change the input specification from multi output to single output and see the results that you get
multiplied by f of r prime and then integrate; integrate both sides right with respect to prime coordinates right
we also saw the general equation for conductivity sigma is nothing but n e mu e and p e mu h
anyway, so you push the specimen here and then you start sweeping from here till like this all the way up to here and then what you do is you take the slope when it crosses the 0 current line or current density and then that slope indicates the corrosion rate, so the higher the slope means that the corrosion rate is higher
so, it means purchase schedule is ready with us and we have now known how much is going to be cash outflow, how much is going to be the liability and this information is available with us
one of the most important ratios in this segment is debt equity ratio which is extensively used by lenders or bankers
maybe i am going to have this as 1 this is 2 and i am going to have the same coil because the coils and the commutator segments are moving together
and this is the this is the circuit is given, it is the series power circuit and this is a current source, this is a dependent current source, and this current is 0
instantaneous power is the power at any instant of time consumed by an element or being supplied by any voltage or current source
so, there is a gap between this one and this one
now, eventually let us assume that, you convinced your friend on the ownership of your pen
now whenever you do a recursive call like this, it is like a while loop; it will invoke the function again, that in turn will invoke a smaller function and so on
it will be in which type
often you would come across this type of a gaze in those people who are about to take a decision
suppose a galvanized steel towers meant your tower member has original length of 22 centimeter and cross sectional area 13 centimeter square with working axial tensile load of 125 kilo newton, the change in length was 0
some wave has come over here this is true in total field or scattered field
so, duration you see it is actually does not matter
similarly, from top if we are looking, that top line coincides
we make a union of all these because a geometric object is any one of them
and the factors which are beyond the control uncontrollable, you identify those factors but we can't do anything because finally all efforts have been made to control the cost but it is not possibilities beyond the control
and it will go against whatever is the spring action, i may have here
we can replace the value of the current il as pl square by… il square will be pl square by vl square into 2r will give you the power loss in the single phase system
important question is that we have to discuss is this method since it gives to change in clock, this clock frequency or some changing this integrator property, ok
now you can see here, the video, right when the capacitor gets charged, the energy gets stored in the capacitor as electro static charge ok
so let us see how do we solve this problem
so this is a first that you have seen that if i throw a magnet through a coil this is which is what faraday did that produces an e m f in that
when i want to check the number of pages i do printjobs colon colon checkpages and it will give me the number of pages remaining, i am sorry it will give me the number of pages remaining from here by invoking this function
is it fat, is it cancer, what is it
so, this works out as 1 to 96 rupees
but, let us say a scenario where i gather that temperature from the sensor through microcontroller, and i pass that information or store that information in some database
so, the movement you change the level of sales and production or a production of say production and sales automatically the raw material cost is going to change
so the stick diagram: these are the v, d, d and the ground lines i am showing for the two gates side by side
so, some amount of this input power will reach port 3
so, i take a cylinder like this ok
and then is the b*t/c we have written it here, so it if you uhhh at both the cost are equal here at this level both the costs are equal that is the uhhh transaction cost is equal to the uhhh or if the opportunity cost is equal to the transaction cost
so, now let us apply one current source and try to solve it
and if you take the rmf value we have to divide it what you call that your in the that your what you call in that magnetic circuit the divided / root 2 everything has been done there right
so, it is sin a cos b plus cos a sin b
so, it means in this case we will have to calculate the standard price because basically the difference between the standard price and the actual price and multiplied by the actual quantity
so if i calculate the bound current, which is sigma b, which is given by n cross n, n cross n, so here if i write vector n along with j direction, and we can see the surface element which is also along the z direction, so sigma b is equal to zero
so the power transformers will be functioning only when the corresponding generator is functioning and it will be almost functioning at 100 percent load to its fullest capacity
they have steel reinforcement
maximum rate of change of output voltage with respect to the input voltage, depends greatly on the device
because both the prices cannot be same, the credit price cannot be same as the cash price otherwise everybody would love to buy on credit
i use you have you have all heard the word of a pseudo inverse
so, together it is a multilevel inheritance red rose is a rose, is a flower
and therefore, you analyze the process; the mental process, the behavioral process, the psychological process
now go to balance sheet
so again, you would notice that if i do e dot d l over the entire path, which i'll write as the line integral, e dot d l is going to be non zero
find what is sublimation
so, i should actually draw i naught which is probably i will show it like this, how should that i am showing it in the correct angle
because, one this is mesh this is, mesh and these two mesh in between one current source is there
now, this, your what you call this i 10 ampere, this is leaving the terminal this one this 16 volt source just hold on this your this is 16 volt source
so, the maintenance function also involves apart from record keeping the licensing of the ip that is already granted
but if we had a common ground then, let me draw it and then i will erase it
so, we will come to you know another example that is your example 7
and that explained why light is able to travel at the speed of light from the sun to us and things like that
this is pity, much like if i have a metallic sphere we consider earlier
ah the way i told, same way it is written right
so in this way you can say that the star source is feeding power to the delta connected load
so, when we know the value of v 1 and v 2 we can find the value of v 4 because that is simply v 1 minus v x and for v 5 also if we know the value of v 2 we can find the value of v 5 that is v 2, here it will be plus v 5 because the direction of voltages from minus to plus, so v 5 would be v 2 plus v y
like for example, you can turn on or turn off a light, you can glow an led, you can turn it off depending on so many things
we have learnt the different types of costs and benefits with suitable examples such as we have seen this direct cost versus indirect cost, direct benefits versus indirect benefits, fixed cost versus variable cost, fixed benefits versus variable benefits
so, we have to diffuse or implant the n type silicon in to the p type silicon why
it's a part of the program in which some shared non preemptible resource is accessed
ok, the interconnections
we shall tell you that how an opto coupler works, you see the opto coupler is strategically placed just in the place where the wheel is rotating, because there are 8 slots in the wheel, and for one complete revolution there will be 8 interruptions
these are kind of the fundamentals of how we can go ahead to understand the operation of various microwave devices these are the fundamentals that we have to know
the conventional approach is that i am just trying to show it diagrammatically here
that is the difference between a hollow block and a perforated block
for instance, broadcasting the play which happens on a stage or storing information about a literary work on a computer or electronic transmission or hosting the work on a website all these things are regarded as technological developments of an existing work they are also covered by copyright
but in this case we need not to worry about having two solutions analyze separately and then summing up because the laplace transform and the circuit analysis using laplace transform will directly give you the complete response of the circuit
the inputs have to be connected to the gates of this two transistors
so this answer is this: two pi cancels gives me two
when we create on object of type heap we call it like a function
so it means there is some problem at some level
so the movement has taken in such a way taken place in such a way that from x1 the distance or the air gap has decreased to x2
50% of the market was with these two companies and the other companies were having the remaining 50% market of india
it has many bits, it has the input clock, it also has a reset
it will allow to pass the low frequencies and block the high frequencies above a particular frequency
so, either plus minus it can be regarded as your dc source or time varying and this one value you make that one your what you call plus minus if you make the larger your larger one larger continuous line is plus and smaller one is minus
for the z smith chart, the right hand side is open
and you can see that the led has started to blink again, so it is ready for connection
so, at a relatively low temperature of around 60 kelvin, you get the donors to be completely ionized
however, in regions of the wall, particularly the middle portions of the wall, the eccentricity is now going to be beyond the middle third of the cross section and so you will have cracked conditions
66 fub by fu it will become 400 by 410 0
because, positive and negative charges cancel, equivalently you can also think of this as being hollow, because electrically it does not matter
increment, okay, increment 1 is first developed, then increment 2 is developed, then increment 3 gets developed
a specialized feature like cut requires additional components like what is the depth of cut, what should be the arc and other options we may have to provide by clicking the things
the outside diameter of this cylinder is 20 mm
now, i come to the interesting part of how my application looks
so, you until that you will be able to see that the input and output are working well, the frequency is going well, you see that 300 hertz is allowing to pass, then we can reduce it to 200 hertz is still allowing to pass, now you see the peak to peak voltage
well python will signal an error saying that this is an invalid key and that is called a key error
the first mechanism of reaction involves the formation of gypsum, right from calcium hydroxide
so, there are large number of users and different users use the statements for different purposes
now the one that we are going to see is very similar let us make it
at the same time if the smell is associated with a currently occurring experience, we retain it in our memory in totality
so, to see that let us have a look at one other thing
so, they can scatter of the atoms quicker
so this comes out to be equal to the integration, comes out to be equal to this charge q times is constant and therefore i can write this as one half q times three q over two r and there is a four pi epsilon zero
we look at pure axial force design
calculate that phase currents of the load angle and the line currents right
then once that has been done, then the body of the rectangle constructed gets executed
he had put verbal content at 7% paralanguage that is tone of the voice intonations inflections etcetera, at 35% and body language that is gestures postures eye contact etcetera at 58%
the focus is on the inventive step, because the inventive step is what will see the invention through at the end of the day
okay, so let us go into the code we will open our editor and look at the sender code first
so, from the perspective of meter the meter is more safe so, this is called at an shunt and so, this is another arrangement one can have and one can compute the values of these resistances depending on the required ranges
with reinforcement you can have multiple cracks, multiple shear cracks that can actually help dissipate more energy
so, what has happened now and if you look at the pricing of the products, if you talk about the colour tvs, colour tvs are say almost available at the same price even today what we were buying the colour tv maybe say how many even 20 years back, right
type c with more minimum requirements of steel becomes a special reinforced masonry category with both these categories being applicable to zones 4 and 5 with r factors 3 and r factor 4
so, in that case this part is also we have not considered start this is this part is also neglected
so, the left hand side is going to be easy
if you do not specify a sort function, there might be an implicit function that the sort function uses; otherwise it will use the comparison function that you provide
your your this equation, we know this equation that your e b is equal to that back emf is equal to write your k your k into your phi into n right
here we will usenode voltage as a circuit variable to solve the circuit
then if that you know the correctly the linearly amplified part is subtracted, then all we will have remaining is the error part
so, we will not be able to calculate price per share ratio
it is a good approximation, in fact it is commonly done ok
even though we find that the expressions of the deaf and dumb can also be understood by other people who do not understand these specific languages for the differently abled people
so, i have to use these fields that i have collected and solve a mathematical problem, this mathematical problem is what is called in inverse problem to get permittivity as a function of space
so, that brings us to an end of the 1d fem equation
in standard cell, floor planning is not required, only placement placing something
similarly in the companies also, at the corporate level also, we plan for the different sub areas and these sub areas are like say we prepare the sales budget, we prepare the production budgets, we prepare the distribution budgets and we prepare the financial budgets
602 into 10 to the power minus 19 coulomb right
so invariably when you reduce the flux you will see a transient increase in the current which will eventually settles down at the original value itself but in the process if ia settles down to the original value the torque has to drop because torque is k phi ia, right
so this is not permitted, you can default the parameter value of a function only once
our old memories often are associated with certain smells and the repetition of a particular smell may carry us backward in time
so what was the term
now, somewhat phasor diagram we have seen that if this is this is my a to n, this is my say your line current is equal to phase current
a needless to say effective feedback also needs to support positive motivation and self esteem that is the feedback should not put down a learner even if the response is wrong and this is again something we are very familiar with from our experience as teachers or learners
advertisers also believe that smell is important and british stores use natural smells such as that of freshly dried linen, chocolate or musk in the air conditioning systems to put customers in a happy and positive frame
now these assets are also required to be amortized
i do not need to know anything about the function except its values at some points, multiplied by precomputed weights i get the integral
the use of those colors which are aesthetically pleasing in our surrounding create a positive stimulation in us at the workplace and they help us in retaining our focus during our official interactions
so, this is so, in terms of implementation why did i sort of take recourse to lossy media because we already know how to implement lossy media in fdtd is not it we will discuss that
which comes out as 2 minus 4 theta m upon pi
so now we have to ah we have to apply kcl at point that is at node p, right
so that is i went through it and i found it to be very useful, you can do it the same way as well
so, let us now, understand the concept with the help of one example so that you can understand the concept clearly, if you see this particular figure in this figure let the initial voltage across capacitor is, 15 volts so, what we have to do, we have to find the value of vc vx and ix for time t greater than 0, so any time t greater than 0, we have to find out the value of vc vx and ix in terms of time t
so, in the case of an amorphous semiconductor, conduction takes place through a hopping mechanism where we think of the electrons and holes hopping through all of these localized defect states
it just represents very thin portion, but material has to be shown by hatched within that zone, this part and that part
and atleast it is 2
you cannot obviously bring it down, what are the remedial measures that you need to take up
so, this current i will be; so, if i call this as v peak then this value i peak will be equal to v peak divided by r m
there could be a situation if i know, give file name not by date, but by event okay
now, turns out based on what we already know, we actually cant solve this problem; we need a new mathematical technique
so, let us look at how we go about building a sequence of instructions that creates this particular target payload that the attacker would want to execute
i could also call it e is equal to 2 what will i call it in e is equal to 2 this is the left node or right node
as we have already seen, when we talked about better c part of c++, we talked about references; we talked about call by reference or return by reference mechanism
answer is yes because
on the other hand, if i say something like go from 0 to 7, where there is no 7th position in the string, here python will not give an error instead, it will just go up to the last position which actually exists in the string below 7
so, this is the voltage 10 exist this is one equation, similarly for your second one, when you apply your what you call now this is the second your what you call this is the second loop and you are covering like this
so, you can see they have a very stable ebita around 15% because their sales have increased, their profits have increased a bit bit but otherwise as a percentage it remains constant
lets write the potential so v at mod r equal to r is equal to one over four pi epsilon zero q over r
let us fix this one and make this pin as floating, right
5 into iy we got 376 into 10 to the 4 then uhh 290
it is prescribed that the flat jack be inserted in a motor joint
i have underlined here for you underlined here right
so, this was your testing function over here and the method we had i mean name for this was given as point matching what point matching was the name we have given right point matching ok
ok, so, talking about clock routing now clock synchronisation is, of course, one of the most important issues in digital systems, which, or most parts, are synchronous in nature, means they are driven by a clock
so, 30 degrees angles we should be in a position to construct every 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180
now as we have seen the the d flip flop which is configured in the way that we have discussed would be able to identify which of these 2 paths has arrived 1st and correspondingly we will be able to switch between 0 and 1
so, 4 percent of f 0; that means, 4 percent of 60 that is it is for upon 100 into 60
so you see, this l f s r does not have an external input
so, in other words we need to assign some names to store these
so, this you can verify offline by solving the integration and putting up the value of cos omega t, the expression will change in that case and you will solve
ingressive sounds occur more commonly as paralinguistic alternates, for example a grasp of terror an ingressive “fff” of physical pain voluntary as well as involuntary aspects of alternates are visible
so then now this y 1 y, if we use that same expression for y that we had used earlier that is y t and x t are related by this relationship, this equation
or you can make a square larger type, four lambda by four lambda
so, we have identified this points remaining things we can erase ok, points are identified
now depending upon what kind of relationship i have between this z and this is my small z
you can also have elements from 2 and 6 again some examples are zinc sulfide, zinc selenide, cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide and so on
so, what will be the voltmeter reading
so in this case the circuit variable was current flowing through 5 ohm resistance, so using super position theorem first you removed the voltage source and then you remove the current source and finally rent flowing through 5 ohm resistance because of both of this sources independently were summed up because it will follow linearity property
so, it is, it may be more also, it does not matter, so when we are talking here, we talk pair of poles instead of number of pole, if you say number of pole then in this case, it is p is equal to 2 pole
after removing how it looks like in that side view or front view, based on the direction
whereas in case of the absorption costing, you have only two steps
so, we are going to take projections onto that inclined plane that inclined plane making inclination angle with vertical plane
so, generally whenever we buy a transformer from the industry, they will only say the impedances so much percentage, that is may be 0
so, here to here q 1 is equal to d; here q 1 is equal to d
this is for phi 1; so, this for phi one over here the same equation that i had written before phi incident and the second term over here is the scattered field right
has n edges and those unknowns continue to be unknown they are not determined
so, coming back to the circuit, we had to connect the circuit as shown in figure
so, this is a framework that you can use both for load bearing masonry constructions and for infill which are partitioned walls in moment resisting frames
so, this is the philosophy now when i am making this your what you call this is this is the current suppose if i make that this is the i c current flowing like this
and at the same time we find that in order to assert power a person can also be very physically distant
there are there are mathematical libraries, matlab has its c++ has it just invoke them they will give you the set of x’s and w’s; plug it into your thing and you have done ok
j for a surface current is like a delta function
so, let me clear up again
however, once the technology started to develop and with the presence of artificial intelligence, when we are looking at an unprecedented development in related fields this conventional personalization has become not only obsolete, but also in many ways redundant
is the pre determined cost based on a technical estimate for materials, labor and overheads for a selected period of time and for a prescribed set of the working conditions
but in a real timetime application when the task share resources, we can't really use a semaphore
if we ask for the intersection of two sets, we use ampersand to denote this
these four zones are a classificatory system for instinctive spacing distances and they are intimate, personal, social and public zones
004 per unit and substation voltage v 1 this one is 1 angle 0 and what your voltage
so, another thing is that this i 3 actually moving like this, right
you can always decompose the linear network into different circuits in which only one source is activated at a time
revenue from operations, this is a income
so wave winding voltage is higher whereas current is lower
what you can see here is a hold against this so that there will be the lines that the camera can capture
and if i say flux density b in the case of magnetic circuit, the same way i can call this as current density
this is called something call a rapper i just talk about it shortly
ok alright; so, far away fields r of the form 1 by r ok
and here we take 2,000 divided by 4,000
and again when we deactivate the input source, this current source drops out, it turns out, okay, you can work it out and see it will drop out, it will become an open circuit because it has zero value
so if there is a poly silicon line and metal line running parallel to each other, what should be the minimum separation between them
now, question is suppose suppose this is your what you call will use dot convention, suppose this is this is dot is here right let us try to understand this
so, 30 degrees inclined to xy axis we have
so, this because there in parallel, because this is a this is your common node this node is a common node so, they are in parallel right; so let me clean it right
why is it that experience this type of state okay
now one thing to remember is that actually square root is not a function available by default in python
is i cancel one of the epsilon zeros, i will, cancels one of the c's becomes c cubed
so, let us see what exactly filters are and how can we design the filters using the operational amplifier
so, v n v n should be greater than v supply r 1 by r 1 plus r 2 ok
so, based on your experience, you have said of 9 years of experience in e learning, can you and give a difference or examples of e learning designs that you think are effective, in those e learning designs that you think are ineffective
this is 1337 minus 981
so, with the example of is 1905, 1987 which is code based on permissible stresses, the way the design occurs as far as 1905 is by limiting the stresses that will occur in the masonry for compression due to gravity forces or compression due to gravity forces plus lateral forces
so, i am trying to show that how printer can be made singleton that is the situation is in the organization possibly i have only one printer
so that would be another, the next problem statement
when here when t is your increasing like t greater than 0 and t is increasing say t tends to infinity right so; that means, this term will vanish only 2 will be there
so whether i am looking at both of them, from the primary side or both of them, from the secondary side, from either side i would be able to say as long as i am drawing 100 percent kva from the transformer, the current that is flowing is 1 per unit, either i watch it from the primary side or the secondary side, so there is no question of transforming from one side to another, i don’t have to do that at all
so this way you can rate the various components
if i am going to use this equation 5 over here my number of unknowns has now become
if you do new with a say a structure type complex, then it will return you a complex star kind of pointer
if you just go buy all the confusing data sheets of buying a camera, you should ensure that there is ah for night
any of this drawfuncion not using their name
so, marginal cost is the amount at any given volume of output by which aggregate costs are changed if the volume of output is increased or decreased by even one unit
i hope that my lectures are interesting to you
everything that is private could be defined separately also
remember this part i have just done in the previous problem, this integration, so i can write this as zero to r
so what is going to happen in this particular case is let us say i have the original speed torque characteristics somewhat like this
in terms of ductility you live with it you say that ok that is a necessary evil that i have to take with and you live with it
so, to look at the ionization energy e b, we typically used a hydrogenic model, but we modify the mass of the electron and also the dielectric constant
so balance plus bank balance both are considered bank balance in which type of accounts if it is in a saving account yes if it is in current account yes if it is in fixed deposit no because as for definition, it should be a demand deposit
it is the standard cost of labor minus actual cost of labor
which are insulated from each other
so, really we cannot increase the temperature beyond the normal operating temperature to increase conductivity it is for this reason that people go ahead and dope or add impurities to an intrinsic semiconductor, in order to form extrinsic semiconductors this increases the concentration of careers and thus increases the conductivity
so, this guy is d is a physical quantity or displacement field when i will stick it into a surface integral i can say it is the contribution will vanish i will only be left with a j and this time j is carrying a positive sign in this equation j was carrying a sorry m was carrying a negative sign
if i is from this direction would like to see the cylinder, the cylinder looks like a circle on that vertical plane
just like append can be done both iteratively and recursively, we can also delete recursively which is if it is the first node we handle it in a special way by moving the second value to the first and bypassing it as we did before
inside our mobile phone, we have an accelerometer or a gyroscope, which gives us the acceleration movement that we make in a day
2 into ze fy by gamma m0 here 1
so, in that case, other tasks may run in between and they may use the partial results obtained by executing a task halfway or maybe partially and that may lead to inconsistency
now, we have the example of robert perneczky, the professor in imperial college london
so, this is part one the phenotype
so, think of a very complicated circuit as complicated as you can think voltage source, current source
and similarly voltage will come later similarly if you come to node 2, then i 2 plus i 3 plus 8 is equal to 0 because all current are entering into the node
so, all the generator shaft; we will try, they will try to set that frequency to their reference value
so when you simplify you will get v 2 is nothing but 8 by 5 i 2
in my next module, i would take up paralanguage for discussions
so this way this r s can limit the in rush start up inrush current and the value of the r s can be chosen such that it is within the rating of the diodes
5 naught 898; this is actually you can neglect right, it has no effect
so this can be part, actually part of the output portion of your rectifier c filter circuit
how does
some of them may already be marked
this my equation two
it is still very likely to be much better than constant vg is biasing but it is not as good as biasing it with an actual current source
so, first you write here is payment for, payment for previous months purchases
i am sure again like i said earlier that lot of people a lot of you guys have already seen how a multimeter looks like
so, if we think of the dimensions one of the things we can do is to provide resources in different formats or different media like videos, websites, text, pictures it could be similar content or related content, but we can vary the medium and include activities and resources in different media within the same course
and this state of arousal the reason that you give, that reason determines what emotion will be experienced and therefore it is called cognitive appraisal theory
we discussed incremental, evolutionary, rad model, and several types of agile models
bulb
when you see an integrated circuit, it can be it can be operated at a way low power compared to the other circuits
that is your f2 is equal to actually, this f2 is equal to actually it is rotor your frequency
so, once again let me write silicon germanium 45, 57, 65, 157
so, suppose if this is q naught so you will change in inflow as well as change in outflow which is causing change in the capacitance of the tank
so all of them have to be essentially pulled, if all of them need to be pulled you require a huge amount of starting torque
so, with this type of object, we can define static and dynamic binding
and this is a microscope which will be or compound microscope
so, what was the kind of scalar shaped function that we had because just to refresh your memory if i had nodes 1 2 3 and some point p in between right
so, it is good to charge more depreciation in the initial years and lesser depreciation in the latter years because initial years repair will be less but depreciation is higher
so, what happens in the inverse problem
so i call them s one, s two, s three and s four
216 ohm inverse centimeter inverse
actual requirement for manufacturing 25,000 units, the cost requirement was or the cost estimates should have been already 15,000
so, in the case of fetal you can mechanically dissociate the tissue
and this is a very dangerous situation which happens quite often, and this is where it is important to separate public from private if they do not have any access to the private implementation of the point then they cannot use p dot x and p dot y
how about the electric field
then there is a condition fear you are not afraid of dog, the kids will play with dogs mothers will shout on bite or somebody will bite
so what activity are we mapping for prince
so, that means, that is that means, if you look into that this is the plus direction and this is the minus, and this is my back emf e b right
on the other hand, for the reflected wave, the size is going to be the same because the velocities are the same
so, we will bring it to we will bring this discussion to a close over here
so, with this with this whatever little bit is theory is there at least at least a first year level whatever little bit is there
do we have; have we learned anything already which helps us to evaluate these integrals
so, v thevenin is equal to v o c and i norton is equal to i s c
594 kvar right
so we have the stack pointer pointing to gadget 1 initially and therefore we have this gadget which we have used which essentially pops the contents of the stack into the edi register
so, we construct fm the factors of m, fn the factors of n, and then from these we compute cf the list of factors in both lists or common factors
ah, one obvious approach can be to to enforce some kind of a conservative design, which means means i am playing safe, i am saying that let clock skew be there
now, when it is loaded this is the circuit at that time it is driving current of 60 ampere right and this is the current say i a 1, r a is 0
so, p g is equal to your 3 i i 1 square into r f because when you make this your what you call when you make this equivalent of this one right
so this is the variable load it will keep on changing
so, another thing is that this method just true for 3 into 3 matrix, remember this is this is what technique is there that is simple method, a simple method for obtaining the determinant of a 3 into 3 matrix is by repeating the first 2 rows and multiplying the terms diagonally as follows, right
so if you look at the nortnet, you see the generated net list
so this sort of a calculation really does not give due consideration to these spaces
so this is ia, this will be phi a or phi armature, right
same answer
so, it has two input terminals, one output and i connect a differential input without any common ground like this; then of course, you can immediately recognize that these two currents here and here must be same
so this essentially tells us about the third method of starting which auto transformer starting
so in this problem we are going to ask, of the four forms given e exponential a is a constant, some constant k x minus v t, square one form, other form is a exponential i k z plus v t
we assume that winds are blowing uniformly and horizontally across the projected area of the conductor, covered without ice and with ice right; two things we have to do
you recall in the cpsr that we discussed in our previous lectures there are some condition flags
so, in this module, let us see how the depletion type mosfet is there, and further how we can operate it and what is the construction of depletion type mosfet
in this video capsule we shall look at rectifiers and capacitor filter
so, v x t is equal to this much and vlt we are writing minus why because here this v x t is equal to minus vlt and v x t will got this much; that means, our vlt is equal to your minus v x t
these green dotted lines are actually portions of circles, now for z for say x is equal to 1, i get a circle like this
let me just show you schematically
so, yeah, it will become clear why i am chosen supposing i choose the delta testing functions ok
rather than doing this, we could have simply loaded the transformer, let us say i have a 2
that means now the energy will be flowing out of this volume and its value is one over mu zero
this is kirchhoff's rule, so the equation that we get for i is l d i d t plus i r is equal to the e m f, or the voltage applied, or d i d t plus r over l i is equal to e
whereas, 1 l eq is equal to 1 upon l 1 plus 1 upon l 2 plus 1 upon l 3 plus 1 upon up to ln, it is same as that your resistance are in parallel when 1 up on r eq is equal to 1 upon r 1 plus 1 upon r 2 like this same as resistor and there initial thing i t 0 is equal to i 1 t 0 plus i 2 t 0 up to i n t 0 this is equation 31 and this is equation 32 right
now, what can be the example
we also distinguish intellectual as something that is special to human beings and not to other beings
in other words the time taken for malloc and the time taken for free is extremely small however it is generally what is seen
so, plus minus look minus as coming to reverse the dot, this way also you can like this then it will also it will become your what you call it will be minus right
the old cost was 10 and at the end it was 12 and there were fluctuations in between
95698 plus j 0
it is the il1 t il2 t and i3t for t greater than 0 and switch is opened at t greater than 0; that means, at this time switch has opened right
so, i would like to given a, and b, i would like write max a plus plus, b plus plus thinking that this will give me the maximum value from the original value if a, and b and then it will give me the incremented value
probably a very, very traumatic experience but what do they see to get it down is the roof
suppose, we want to take our string “hello” and change it to the string “help
can you consider people as your assets
let us start from scratch over here once again
in lifo, asset value will be lower and profit will be lower
the answer to this is that every time the foreground task runs, it runs for 50 milliseconds
we have learnt about the feasibility of different data members and member functions of a class
so, these kinds of tricks, they help us to save a lot of computational time right
so we can provide a splice plate finally as 380 by 250 width we have considered earlier and 6 mm we have calculated the thickness
so, therefore, ideally what we would like to have is that the ammeter should have zero internal resistance, zero internal impedance
they are the standards, attainable standards are the standards based on levels of performance that can be achieved by realistic levels of efforts
so, basically throughout taking your modules, they are given leader boards or they are given certain ranks or they are given something where in a gamified you have a competition between your learners, and so that they try and compete the entire session, they try and win it
in the other example, the energy was taken away from a volume and that energy initially was stored as electromagnetic energy
one of the line is is going to show it in normal to that direction you have to be careful in using mouse
and apart from it what you can do is out here i am using a light green color from entering from this one to this part, because you have partitioned the room you can put the sticky mats
use arrow heads at the end of the dimensions, arrow heads one has to use
it is something like this: suppose we expect that capital t is our time budget, with which everything should get stable
whatever i shown look r 1 is equal to when you take r 1 product of this adjacent branch rb rc by ra plus rb plus rc
so as the number of bits increases, this ratio approaches point five
the scope of a name in python is the portion of the code where it is available to read an update
so, again we have to say f is open input dot txt r and now we can say while for line in f dot readlines for each line
so, maybe that is a bad idea
so, instead of charging straight line depreciation which will be uniform or instead of charging depreciation at a certain rate, we will calculate it on per hour basis and then based on the hours in that particular year we will compute the depreciation
how it can start or restart or reset
c and there is essentially, did a lot of things, there was a main and there was a concatenate first chars function and i have to give credit to the students who wrote this codes
if i calculate del f i, del u, del f i, del u, del f i, del u means i, one expression like this
what i am worried specifically about are these two and i would like minimize the losses as much as possible, right
so, i have a simple a complex class which i have written in term of a structure
so, if i make the entire circuit on the breadboard entire circuit
this is an n mos, so the input is coming here, the output is going from here
so, this is valve or gate this is your turbine this is pm just now i have shown this is your generator this is electrical power output right ah this is going to your just now, i have shown this ah diagram right this is your pm and this is electrical power output not shown here this is p e right p e and what whenever we will assume all this thing analysis we will assume that turbine is a lossless there is no loss, right
now if some current i is flowing in this direction, then it will create some magnetic field and you can find the direction of the magnetic field using any rules you like
it gives you peak at around twenty three point four degree in xrd
however, to get a better alignment what we do is we add some nops initially so the nops is present by this opcode is given by this opcode 90 and whenever the processor sees this opcode of 90 it is just going to skip the instruction to nothing in that instruction
and this one supposed to get coincided and this part coincide up to that level
so, mode 0 is the simplest one; so, let us try to understand
so, what is our goal
so, if you look at how do you arrive at the equivalent frame for a given wall, a wall may have openings of different sizes
so what we can do, we can create a super mesh because if you have current source between 2 messages, we can create super mesh and solve it
this is i r into r that is your resistive ah that is that r into r that drop related to the register ah resistive part
that’s what my friend told me, my client who is also my friend, good friend
ok that was linear equation in three variables when two variables you had two variables one variable, one variable
that's why it is sometimes called near to zero slack algorithm, not exactly zero slack
that, but everything is 1 plus s t g 1 plus s t t and in this form therefore, in this block diagram what you do you put that s tends to 0
so, considering parabolic configuration figure – 14 shows the condition this is if you consider a parabolic one this is your figure – 14
so if there are, if there are two different nets, they have to be laid out in a non in a disjoint fashion, with non intersecting line segments
he was talking of psychology on the brain processes placing the whole complex aberrations into psychiatry
now, we did not draw the top view
suppose there is a small noise voltage v t, this is the noise voltage
how can i make b in equal to 0
so, in any sector you talk about after globalization of indian economy, after liberalization of indian economy, the supply side has improved in a very effective manner
so, this current is i a, this i ca current it also coming here, so plus i ca and this current is your what we call it is leaving, so it is minus i ab is equal to 0; that means, my i a is equal to i ab minus i ca right
iit is very easy, do not do not worry if system looks very complicated
how much of so3 is coming if there is nox how much it would be
so, that is why this is written for you that keep in mind that right
so, the atmosphere has ozone; it also has some water molecules so these can scatter the solar radiation
so, we have helium, neon argon and so on
so, little bit understanding is required
now we talk about the different types of the standards, right
so one input of this can come from r three and the other one come come from another register, r four
same way it can be cost of sales upon average stock or average inventory for inventory turnover ratio
debencher also is a type of loan
so, for example you talk about here is say we were talking about that the budgeted performance was say 7 lakh rupees of the sales
banks normally say that we will finance 75% of vehicle
the first model which tried to look at memory in terms of the three types of structures based on its temporal programming
so, this is schematic diagram so, basically this is a flat i mean longer switch
so regardless of what load you connect, you will get the same gain
so, using v v prime use arcs construct then drop it
the source is grounded
so, here i write this utp and here i write ltp
offline reference materials for further learning, yeah right
how the deposition is done
this is the first drawing what we would like to have i am just naming it like part1 2d drawing
do something that is your homework, do something by yourself understand how the noise is generated all right
so, this is the problem that you have to find out the current flowing through this 3 ohm resistance say, in this direction 1 to 2 so, between 0
so if we see, because of the bearing at the support, so dispersion will happen like this: this is the flange and up to this it is the root of the web, so it will disperse, up to this with 25 is to 1, so so we have to find out: this is as n1 and this is as b, so b plus n1, the length of this
next we have to see the metal contact, after which we will see lithography and finally, understand the process flow for the mosfet
that means v p is equal to v n at this point
so, in that case, it will be 10 ohm and i told you, here it is 25 ohm right, this is missed actually
equal how to convert from the z smith chart to so now we are in the gamma plane corresponding to the z smith chart
how many local triangles i mean local triangles there are six are there right
so, what i will be doing, the accelerometer will be getting the x, y, z coordinates
diffusion is where if you put some material in a fluid, it starts diffusing slowly, or evaporation is also kind of diffusion, if you like, loosely
there are other development boards as well, but in this course we will be taking the opportunity to take these two specific boards into consideration and we will be discussing the experiments based on these two boards
so, it means he would like to make sure that yes, it is accepted and implemented in the later in spirit and objectives achieved
then i can also have some flip flops
at the same time we can also imagine situations in which we may be expected to practice a particular kinesics aspect
947; so, it is plus is here bottom here right and it is moving like this, and this is r thevenin with that 2 ohm resistance you connect now and you will get the value of the current
boss feature is the one where you are going to extend the things add material and other things
so, this is sort of brings us to a summary that right
j equivalent m equivalent and in the surface equivalent principle i replaced the object by tangential surface currents ok
so now ohm that is gs ohm actually is a lifespan was 1787 to 1854
but when you use the marginal costing technique and we use the different kind of the analytical tools available under this technique, as i told you contribution margin, then you talk about a breaking point analysis, we talk about the pv ratio
so, let us make the assumption we will start with a very simple assumption of a medium and as we go in subsequent modules we will generalized it ok
so, just by doing index calculations for a position in the heap we can figure out where itõs children are and by reversing this calculation we can also find the index of the parent, the parent of j is that j minus 1 by 2
so intuitively, this gates can be inserted either to handle this or to handle this long interconnection lines, maybe instead driving directly this long line, you insert, you replicate it and anther copy to use which will be used to drive these and these gate you can locate in a suitable position, not here may be, you can place it here and here
for this front view if you are looking at that what we are going to see is; this one as the object as a step and that goes maps via there comes there these lines coincides with that and again these lines will coincides in that way
e has 3 components, because it is a vector quantity, we have e x in x direction is y component and e z and these are all functions of x, y and z, these are all functions of x, y and z, x, y and z
and voltage across the resistance is v r, and across the inductance is v l right, our objective is a steady state analysis right
and if it can be converted into planar circuit you can simply run your mesh analysis
so, when i write down this divergence theorem, i have to right down the flux through both surfaces right
so, this goes into the first component now what are the vector e
6 shape functions ok
welding, for example, if you try to weld directly from the power supply, what will happen is, because it is a short circuit, most the times welding happens when there is an arch struck and you are going to put the electrode right there
it can be shown that the total input s 1 1 here
so, it is expected of you to have an understanding of graphics, you are expected to have an understanding of software tools which are used for development, you cannot go blank
i shall show you now how to make a sample script for designing the certain, designing the values of the components
so, therefore, the therefore, this the circuit of 226 is called a voltage divider, right
and it is actually maxwell who came in 1864 who said that these equations; there is an inconsistency in them
so, to understand that, if after this object has been constructed if you immediately after that if you print this object
now, when rights offer you exclusivity; it means that you have a right to stop people from doing certain acts
like that you can calculate a few cash flow ratios
so my p two is done
so, naturally total is 250
and the value of the register depends on the operating point
so when i expressed the impedances in terms of percentages or per unit, it really does not matter whether i am expressing everything from the primary side, everything from the secondary side, partially i am expressing something from the primary side, partially i am expressing something from the secondary side
let's say we have solved it for a particular value of vs which is 5
so, that is taken as the point at which the data bus will have the opcode available
so the peak positions first of all is determined by the size and symmetry of the unit cell
you know, and
so you can just go back to that zone representation between
so, if you look into that, that that this current or voltage
these are also meant for simple applications where there is not enough memory and processing power to run a full blown event driven real time operating system
now, the difference between a coupled line coupler and the other couplers that we have discussed so far is that we cannot take a single value of this characteristic impedance for both the systems
so, energy is measured in joules
i will make three or four line lines like this and this e field is nothing but q over four, pi, epsilon, zero, r square, where r is a distance and this field is radially out
so basically you need to account for the fact that part of your wall based on your calculations should have cracked and past part of the wall may be in the uncracked condition, which means you have now different cross sections to deal with as far as load equilibrium is concerned
now, similarly you can ask the same question that if at any moment the output is negative, how can i make it positive ok
now c is connected to d in this fashion here c is connected to d in this fashion and here c is connected to d in this fashion
another aspect which is interesting about this emerging area is that the communication related with food has an everydayness
and once dc part will be over, we will go for your what you call single phase ac circuit
if that is the case draw projections of cd and find angles with horizontal plane and vertical plane
its projection a projection on horizontal plane precisely maps at o
so, that's what we're going to be looking at today
so, every point on this cylinder has constant voltage
this gives as an error
a smiles communicate different connotations and at the same time there are certain cultural associations which are also associated with the way we smile and the way in which we interpret the smile of other people
so, what is what i wanted to convey in this particular module is the basis behind numerical integration, simple numerical integration ok; as we go further we will look at little bit more complicated ideas ok
so, the stability happens only in the linear region, not in the hyperbolic region
now i am trying to find out under what conditions can the output value change to one
so, this voltage depends on these two factors
so, this is an assumption which is erring on the conservative side and so is an acceptable assumption itself
we are only talking about definite integrals alright
so, from equation your 60
so the stack is at this particular time pointing to this location and therefore the address of this particular gadget return is loaded into the edi register and at the same time as we know the pop would increment the stack pointer to be pointing to this location
so, you can always find a sufficiently small value of lowercase vd the increment where these terms are negligible, okay
but a mooc contains videos with in video embedded activities questions followed by immediate feedback, discussion forums and peer review, interactive sessions such as on hangouts, virtual labs, personalized communication with learners and several other such elements
so, typically n i is written as n c and n v exponential minus e g over 2 k t
so, and then in the, this is the condition here that is the depreciation is $2,500 monthly
so these with these initial values, as have calculated
so obviously you are going to cause differences in the way that the attack manifests itself in the field
so, here i am some writing that v is equal to right m is equal to your v m divided by t by 4 right into the t this is the straight line passing through the origin because this time you say t right
so, as parents many a times adults become very concerned whether my child is a normal child is growing normally or whether there are some issues with my child
so, let us consider the case where we have code present outside the enclave, and it is making a memory access to data which is also present outside the enclave
just justdo it little bit yourself you will get it very simple, right, but everything i am marked for you
you have this cells arranged in rows, but if you find that the space you have kept for the channel is not sufficient, you can always move the two blocks away
and then who knows, i will not be around to worry about that but some of you will
so during the test you need to monitor the dial gauge reading to get the elongation at different intervals of loading
if i am looking at area perpendicular to s, you can see one element is going to be in the x y plane, like this, and the second element of this area is going to be in the z direction
then use those basis functions to simplify your expand your integral equation and convert it into a discrete set of equations which finally, gave you a linear system of equations and we solved it
8 degree, minus 120 degree, so minus 141
so, we have a sigma and the sigma star, this just represents one bond
in the previous lecture we looked at the line surface area and volume element in cartesian and cylindrical coordinates
so, same way, what does exactly filter means, that the thing or a system or a tool or a device that we can use or an organ if you take talk about it is an organ, so anything that can help us to remove the unwanted signals, unwanted things
we have thickness of the wall which is t by 2 and t by 2, one half of the thickness is t by 2
there is a shortcut that you can do and that is in terms of a friend class
in this case if you see the arrangement of watt meters the current coil is connected in series with the phase a and phase c
so, remember this is like a hypotenuse of a right angled triangle
so, consumer products, consumer durables, automobiles mean the industrial products everywhere there is a competition
i again probe in the middle, depending on the probe either i have to see in the left half or the right half; i repeat this process
i generate a netlist of cells where the cells are picked up from the technology library
so, there was only there is differentiation there is integration, there is nothing more fancy like exponential or something like that right
now i will show you actually what happens you have this very response sheet, where you have part one which has to be do with spelling and then you have part two which has to do with sentences and then as you can see there are radio buttons here where one is suppose to put the responses
so what will happen now is the concrete that is in the centre that is entrapped between the reinforcement that is still about 30 to 40 millimetres away from the exterior surface
some researchers suggest that a distinction has to be drawn between fashion and anti fashion
and if i take macroscopically very small volume, there is like a continuous distribution, just like in charge density, also in a very small volume, macroscopically small volume, it's a charge distribution, continuous kind of distribution
so one of them will be selected
when in case of capacitor voltage rises to steady state value while in case of inductor voltage settles down to 0 and similarly current in this case is settling to a steady state value while in case of capacitor the current will settle down to 0
only then f will be equal to 0
now i am going to talk about the galvanic anode cathodic protection which is produced by a different metal
how we can give biasing to this op amp, we have not seen we will see in the class number 2, or we have seen the class number 2 or 3 if i correctly remember, that when we use an operational amplifier, we have to give a bias voltage
those are a few thinks that we shall be looking at an explaining in our next lecture
so, that means, emf on the i mean if you later we will see it will be a different way
so, far we spoke about te polarization
what it says, is that given a volume large volume and vector field through this i did this summation divergence of v delta v over all boxes
and, it will print all these values here
so, i want to plot how mu e or mu h changes with concentration of the dopants
so, this emf equation is given actually in that magnetic circuit i have given
at the mid height the section is completely cracked but the line of thrust is passing through a point which is now the hinge and we are considering that almost two blocks are capable of rotating about the hinge itself and still continue to equilibrate the axle load that is acting on the eccentric axle load that is acting on it
so, this is basically suppose it is a cloud is shown and this you are what you call that ice crystals are showing by this arrow right the rain, then snow, all these things are shown in the diagram
so we need to be examining the state of biaxial stress that develops and it's this which becomes the basis of the principal stresses which we need to examine and arrive at some failure criteria
but remember freud’s now anal stage was 2 to three, but 0 to 2 was the in oral stage now
now, if i if i tell you that this is a metal, 2 metals are there
whereas synchronous motor current i would be able to adjust in such a way that, if it is hardly having any mechanical load i may have only a reactive current, hardly having any reactive, real load
this exercise you do it finding out your what you call that rather than low voltage side full load current you will find out that your what you call a high voltage side full load current
so, i can choose the total field or the scattered field, but in region ii i should not make my variable scattered field, because your update equations and i mean maxwell’s equation scattered field does not obey maxwell’s equations in the region ii
so now finally what will become i is equal to 5 cos omega t plus 126
i is nothing but the static estimate of the eccentricity which is what we have been doing all along
so, all it says is that you start with the two words u and v, you initialize this lcw thing at the boundary at the nth row on the nth column and then, now you remember the maximum value
the uniformity across the substrate should be right
but if you do not, if you do not consider this first, if you are consider this one initially, so in the middle, you really do not know the exact position of these signal
what kind of environment it should be
so, let me make a box
that's why it has become a kind of global act
ok, now here we show two phase clocking
in the example shown here, the image on the top allows the learner to play with the variables move the two balls around have the wall or remove the wall
so, i add and subtract incident field fine
so, in every second the relay will be switching on and off 50 times
8, 11
so it will appropriately take the net list from here
this is based on the test results of page
so dependent source may be voltage or current source should be left intact in the circuit
so, this df will be given by a set a summation of the changes due to a change in x due to change in y and a change in z right
the value of e i delta l is going to be e x, and let us take this previous point here to be representing e, x, e, x, y, delta x over two
i can make it go against the gravity at 2 meters per second five meters per second
in case of the small scale burrowers we talk about the limits up to 5 crores
and liu lehutski's results become applicable
81 but actually, there should not be any doubt or anything
so, what we will see is the frontal one a continuous line, this entire line goes all the way to apex and this entire surface maps as this surface
it can be inductive; it can be a capacitive
exactly, right, and therefore right, do you have approval to plays these games
ah, just because you have to eliminate that delta terms
if we look at the definitions of body language or the nonverbal aspects of communication, we find that different dictionaries have tried to define them in interesting manner
so, that is what is the scattered electric field, similarly i can take the difference in the magnetic field with and without object and difference i will call as the hs, s for scattered right we call this scattered
so, analysis that will not be consider in this chapter right
so, note that if the switching takes place at time t is equal to t 0, if it is at t switching takes place at t is equal to t 0, then it will be then it will be that it will be i t 0
it is a buyer's market now all around the world all around the globe
enclose your front view
because galvanized steel is just coating of zinc on the steel and that gave me the opportunity to understand how the zinc works in a concrete environment and we were trying to see whether galvanized steel could last sufficiently in the concrete environment
so whenever a signal, a digital signal we are talking about zero one it traverses over long distance
so, do no t worry about this one
so, when they came up with the act, they allowed university technology to be diffused into and taken up by the industry
d v over d, z is going to be q over four pi, epsilon zero
h11 represents the impedance because it is the ratio between v1 and i1, h12 is the voltage gain because this is a relationship between v1 and v2, h21 is the current gain because it is again the ratio between i2 and i1 and h22 is the admittance because it is ratio between i2 and v2
and let us see the change in the output voltage when we apply different signal at the input voltage all right
6 and 427
so, if you move like this it is encountering minus terminal plus, because clock wise we are moving
now in general python will allow you to mix ints and floats, so i can write 8 plus 2 point 6 even though the left is an int and right is a float and it will correctly give me 10 point 6
so, it is not a part of cash and cash equivalent, it should be treated as a current asset
so so directly, you are doing, let us say, thirty frames per second ah, your capturing thirty f p s
in this case it is assumed, it is given that no bad debts are going to be there and there is a 100% recovery of the credit sales though all all the sales are on credit
so, across req voltage impressed is your v, same voltage v will be impressed
has something has to counted at 0
so we saw that our scattering parameters relate the incident to the reflected normalized reflected or normalized reflected voltages or currents suit this equation so with in mind let us for a moment and we also saw that the voltages, the normalized voltage, let us remove the bar here and just assume that v and i hence port means the normalized voltages and current
tapers solve that problem they help to gradually move from one impedance to another impedance and in that way they enable us to have smooth impedance transition as well as tapers are also often used in antenna structure
now, this rappers allow inter operability in terms of test communication
25 kilonewton so if the reaction at d is 182
so, that arc one has to join it
we have three entries we can fill up this, we have three entries we can fill up this and we can fill up this column and we can do this column and we can do this column by column and we propagate it and then finally, the value the propagates here is our longest length of the longest common subsequences, we could also do this row by row
so, under the action of the external moment and the load, the total length of the wall is lw, the neutral axis, the effective depth is lw minus d dash which is d effective
so, that is that is the sort of a intuition over here
so, you can have what is called a line crack splitting the unit or you can have a stepped crack that actually follows the pattern of the courses, the joints and that's typically when the joint shear strength is far lower in comparison to the tensile strength offered by the unit itself
so, you are going to have essentially no load test being done when the motor is running freely without being connected to any other or coupled to any other mechanical load right, when i am going to have no load test you thing about the induction motor characteristics
so, that is the set up and i have some wave falling like this getting reflected over here and my goal is that this reflection coefficient should be 0 in the worst case right that is what i want to design
so, in that case that your current is maximum and these current say it is i 0 i 0 is the maximum current at resonance frequency when omega is equal to omega 0 or f is equal to f 0 right
so he was really enamoured by it
in india we do not use the stainless steel rebar much but mostly we use these type of you know a706 or a615 type steel or steels which has very similar chloride threshold
so, assuming the volt drop in the windings is negligible
and this is circuit symbol fixed, this is for fixed and this is for figure b for variable capacitor right
so stress strain curve of the mild steel we will see first say this is strain which is called epsilon, and this is stress which is called sigma
we can do it otherwise
so this is going to be c
let us try to see whether we can measure reactive power in a three phased system directly, balanced system
the particular party who has done the repair has not yet sent the bill
overall when i calculated with reference to its own base, i will get ultimately the voltage drops to be, you know happening at the same percentage values, right
the current is a non zero value because this current has made some of the domains to align in the opposite sense but already whichever domains have been aligned in the forward sense or the previous sense, both of them essentially cancel out with each other, so the net magnetic field or flux available becomes a 0 at this point
it has a typical signature of having the same name as the name of the class, so by the name you know this is a constructor it has a little bit of different way of putting things and we will discuss that more
how much current i will require to start this machine that may be enormously high when i talk about very large capacity synchronous motor
if there is no speed governing system means that delta p g is equal to 0 you have to take; this should be in your mind that whenever they say no speed governing action means delta p g will be 0 right
it goes to minus infinity and if so it is capturing the singularity well and j 0 as a finite quantity 1 ok
we indicate ac by sine wave
so, here my plot is i d versus v g s; i d versus v g s
sir u 2 will be 0 there fine
hence this whole concentration will act as a band stop filter
this is what we have to do and to compare with this we have this comparator and to compare with this we have this
so this is only on the surface
so, any level of nesting is possible for namespaces
it's like when we read f of x y in mathematics it means x and y are arbitrator values and for every x and y do something depending on the values that we a call the function with
but in other cases where we expected two cell thousand or ten thousand of the chips in the market, so doing or going through that exercise is not means worth the the pain or the effort, right
next, i have a vertical line here, in this block, here i have a vertical line here, in this block
now what we do want over here is that we want to overflow the buffer in such a way so that the return address is modified
the i x was simply suffix to pos, the portable operating system to make it look like a unix standard
so here we see the oil drops, these will move over time and these can then be detected by the webcam and analyzed automatically
take another example
so if i look at it from the top, if i look at this cylinder from the top, what is happening is here is a material, chi e, and we have put it in a uniform field going in the y direction
so, their current current ratio will be very less so it changes from the nature of business it also depends on characteristics of cacl like we were talking that company a may have 2
3 is a number that comes because of the assumption of the ratio of sigma x to sigma y
so, a system consists of 4 identical 400 mva generating units right feeding a total load of 1016 megawatt; 1016 megawatt right
on the other hand in the usa listeners are encouraged to have a direct eye contact and to gaze into the speakers eyes
i am given the scattered field
let us say that this is one antenna over here, let us say this is you know air traffic control and this is another air traffic control over here
third, we have learnt that curl of b and this i am talking in free space, there's no medium in vacuum is equal to mu zero, j, which you can say is bio savart law
v 3 say here i am writing like this 14
you have to plot q t and i t
so that means that it is one sided that is unilateral laplace transform
how much of pet coke was used, how much of limestone was used, how much of clay was used for making the 1 ton of clinker
now, when you say that the blocks are in series combination it means that the blocks, the output of one block will go to other block as an input then we will see that these two blocks are in series
let us close the circuit, the schematic and now you see that in the dcdc folder we have rectifier
so, if the first thing is there that because of the extra caution efficiency care of the purchase department if the cost has come down, it is a laudable effort and they should be appreciated for that
so kd is something we still don't know and is the reason why we need to have an iterative approach
so, this is 1 but these 2 together your f ip plus f lp is equal to 1 minus f hp right this is the thing so; that means, intermediate pressure fractional power developed in the intermediate pressure and low pressure cylinders is equal to 1 minus the power developed in the high pressure cylinder
ok, so what i have just now mentioned is that each logic gate, or the simple functional blocks which are supposed to be there in a standard cell library, are available in multiple sizes
also forgetting might also represent the distortion of recollection of the past, so the truth was something else and you narrate something else okay, which is completely devoid of the reality
so, let us see this actually in the experiment, we will connect we will take a operational amplifier 3 resistors of this value, we connect it, and let us see the output voltage initially
so, next is your suppose this is the your what you call this is your two coils in the your what you call mutual inductance m 2 1 of coil 2 with respect to coil 1
after this i set t c to one and i apply this corresponding p i zero, one zero, i apply zero, one zero
we took silicon, then we have grown thin layer of silicon dioxide
so, it improved the way, in which information was supplied to the customers and we will later on look at the dispute between hindustan unilever limited and amul where, the fact that information supplied through the mark led to dispute between these two entities
if you notice we have looked at a few elements now, so this is the first one which is setting a base for who is this person and what are they doing
8 than sin theta 2 is equal to 0
there are two registers, there is some combinations, circuit in between, with delays of six nano signals
so, i hope now you are clear with thisese components within this equipment
so, during the course of the lecture we first studied how generally lights interact with semiconductor materials, we then looked at some specific examples and applications of this
so, when we draw the band diagram between a metal and a semiconductor, we have to show the bands bending in the case of semiconductor to explain this contact potential
so, that will be a straight line passing through the origin like this ok
so but here it was forty four; that means, loss has decreased due to the shunt capacitor placement right
if you are writing a c++ program and including a c standard library header then as i have mentioned, you will need to prefix the c standard library name with a c
because you are not providing sufficient water for that covercrete to cure and develop the microstructure, so what we need is something like this where both concrete inside and outside the reinforcing reinforcement cage is of good quality
so we call this as the remnant flux
the state of the itself can be either empty, or it can be an obstacle, or it can be a label which is numbered between one and this maximum
now the question is as you overload, you will also hide the inherited function that you have inherited from the base class
time derivative of e x that is i am talking about this guy over here and what are the values being subtracted
so, it is r minus this, so for the inductive case it is r plus j x l, and for capacitor capacity case it is r minus j x c and x c is equal to 1 upon omega c right
so, this is the flux path for n to s right this is conductors, and this is your armature
so how many lines connecting this distance between these blocks
and what is important to note is just in like four days, hundred hours,right, roughly most of the ye'elimite is reacted
py, specify a binary as the input and provide the path to the executable, which you want to evaluate
because all our machines are rotating machines
so, if you see this finally, you get vo equals to 0 has no meaning
we fixed vgs to 3 volts
second approach is minimum spanning tree
let us take one more example, here we have an object and cut plane section let us call a a; retain this portion, remove this part
the buses are connect to several function units and they can communicate
we said before that python is very useful for manipulating text and one other thing that you would like to do is actually read and say a paragraph of text or multiple lines of a document and not have to worry about the fact that these are multiple lines just store it as a text value as a string
if poornima has to integrate, she has to understand the whole code and then edit that make changes within that and that will become a complete nightmare
so, the voltage across this as well as across this lag will remain same because both are in parallel
there are lot of lines, lot of lines not connected with each other not connected with each other
5 henry inductor is half l i 0 l 0 square
why dont we design and develop a more conventional as a chip and send it to the fabrication facility
maintenance of course will have problem because the numbers are not what you call arranged in hierarchy rather they are more randomized
so, there is something wrong with the product a or the input a
63 volts per microsecond, but my specification says that my slew rate should be 0
so, the notion of the largest common factor will always be well defined for any pair m and n
basically different steel have uhh been produced based on uhh necessity by changing uhh the chemical composition and manufacturing process
so, in summers you lose salt; so sodium level falls down and that triggers off psychosis
so, this is what are wave equation which was very nice to look at in continuous coordinates, but in the discretize version these are all the terms that we did right
this is output at v o which i have shown with arrow, this one
this depends on this resistances
so, length of the base that is over a half cycle
the s and p orbitals hybridize to give you 4 s p 3 orbitals
so, for large data we are forced to deal with files which reside on the disk
so, this will be 30 micro farads and again we will see 60 and 30 if you have make it add it up because they are in parallel
by default i think you all know that any interest received will be generally considered as an investing flow because you make investment you get interest but there are exceptions which are equally important so keep in mind three exceptions if the investment is of cash equivalent nature or the interest is received on trade advances or operating receivables the interest will be a operating inflow and if all the interest received is for a finance enterprise like a bank, then it is a operating flow
now, this clear crystal is placed or mounted between 2 metal plates which you can see here right
so, you again come forward with 16 different types of temperaments
so, minus 3 joule now total energy if you sum it up w 1 plus w 2 it was 2
so, i will wait for a moment, you can stop this video, do the calculation and then we to discuss the solution
you know that, this is the problem that is seen in the receiver, that we have a desired channel but because of the interferers, there are now additional components in the desired channel and thereby it core ups the desired channel
so, both are functions of r now is the most general thing the good thing is that i do not have to specially say this is valid for region 1 this is valid for region 2 its a general equation
and, in trimetric we will have different three angles and something like less than 30 degrees and more than 30 degrees, such kind of projections we call trimetric projections
so row unit is ohm meter
normally we are going to purchase in the month of march so we will put the value there against the month of march but column has to be here
now admittance is nothing but reciprocal of impedance and it is measured in siemens or you can say it is also measured in mho
do not worry so, much about the limits over here, previously i was going from epsilon to a, but i may as well have gone i could have written the previous example as something like this log of mod x and gone from minus a to b the same thing what happened right i would break it up into two parts
for this she decided to watch a video which had voiceover and diagrams relevant diagrams that explain the various stages of the voiceover
now, from a drop a perpendicular all the way up; similarly, drop a perpendicular all the way from b to c
in literature and awareness of different aspects of nonverbal communication has always been there
we can systematically compute the fault list for all the lines
when current flows through the coil of the electromagnet due to the magnetic field produced this material becomes a magnet and the two magnets either attract each other or there will be a repulsive force there will move away from each other
performance again depends on the application
so then the net b2 should be the summation of the contribution of a1 upon 2 and a1 upon 2
if you plot the variation of current i with respect to time t the response would be like shown in the figure
so, therefore, and that corrected apparent power is s 2 is equal to p upon cos theta 2 there for 6942 upon 0
using these one can derive expressions for curl by the definition of curl, divergence by the definition of divergence in these coordinate systems also
so, this x to the power k over here notice that k is maximum n minus 1, you can take k equal to 0; that means, the average of p n is 0, then i take x x square all the way up to x n minus 1 ok
so, different ways of bracketing correspond to different evaluation orders for this multiplication
this particular plant uses waste phosphogypsum from tutticorin from the fertilizer industry phosphogypsum is a waste so that is taken and used in the cement manufacture
it means it is corroding
so it's just a nomenclature and a convention
now, let us see other aspects of the transformer using transformer voltage and current transformation equations, we can now represent voltage that is primary site voltage in terms of secondary site voltage and primary current in terms of secondary current or vice versa
now let us see what are the critical service life parameters
so, as we use them, there is some wear and tear, there is some value loss because of utilization
now when you are bringing a finger near to it, there will be a coupling through your finger
the step is there because the film thickness is very large compared to thin film
so if you deposit money in bank you withdraw money from bank, this is a change within the cash and cash equivalent
spherical right because it has r theta phi everything is there inside it
now, the literary work need not be something that has value or something that has literally merit copyright law does not consider or does not get into the details of the literary merit of a work
6 vz square so this will be 0
this is what i said with respect to time
first was the 35 kg that is the opening stock
from there centered one i am going to use some arbitrary square
so that is a different way of processing, so i want to show you some results with the carbon nano tube, so these are fractur e tests and these are mortar specimen with water to cement ratio 0
so when gates are fabricated in the vlsi chip using the kind of deep segmum submicron technology that we use today, there can be lot of variations in parameters, like one gate can be having a delay of five, or the other gate can be having a delay of four point seven
and this search request would indicate what is the time and cost that has to be expended in the search
and also discussed about the ideal transformer and their various connections and the polarity
who conducted experiments on forgetting and he basically what he did was he again use the nonsense syllables okay tried to see how much people forget okay over a period of time so forgetting was actually experimentally verified in terms of decline of memory as a function of time
state where this information from the case can go to the where it has to go to and largely it has go to the cash budget as well as the profit and loss account
we know the how the buck converter operates and when we know of the pole voltage will be
so, capacitor is typically constructed using 2 conducting plates, separated by an insulator or dielectric
shortly we will also look into that how to obtain the input output relationship of the buck boost converter
is there any relation between n and m
so all the internal activities of the chips, of the chip, they are synchronized with respect to the clock that is applied from outside
so, how we will get the second equation
and then you have a j by that is i do not need i mean all i want is some way of simplifying
and how does that work
now, i will be dumping the code one by one to show both the things
now, this is, ah, this kind of a notation or this kind of a diagram is sometimes called as schematic, or we also sometimes refer to as a symbolic layout, but usually symbolic means each of our regions are represented by either a color or different shade
the basic virtual function i am pointer table mechanism by which we can do things
so, we do not take into account what is the probability of occupation in order to do that we need to look at the fermi function
so, clock is clock frequency will be higher if you make a smod equal to 1
so, the we are contrasting that as in c, if we define something as struct, every operation we need to do with it, we need to be done through some global functions that anybody and everybody can see and use
suppose in this case there are n mesh and then you apply kirchhoff's voltage law to each of the n mesh and use ohm's law to express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents and then solve the resulting and simultaneous equations to get the mesh currents
in this case, now we have to calculate the budgeted contribution margin per unit
but the very fact that he was dressed in this manner suggested that he had an emotional attachment with the masses of our country and he truly represented them
so, now, whatever the network we have, we can represent with its equivalent thevenin voltage and thevenin resistance
so, what we can do we can connect one input say to the ground
so we shall be continuing with our discussion in the next lecture
mostly my notebook
so, in the previous class we learned about how to prepare the cost sheet and how to calculate the different sub costs and finally arrived at the total cost of production and the operating profit
so voltage drop is equal to r equivalent plus jx equivalent multiplied by i load and a have to look at i load also along with its power factor, otherwise it doesn’t make sense
so, i is nothing but j times which is jso a expevkt, v is 0
once you do it, it might come off, it and hence it is not reliable
there is something else connected to the gate that i will add on later
some functions are done by the team, there internally other functions are delegated to a third party service provider
so, biologists have done this
what i mean is if zl is the short then z in will appear to be as an open or if zl is an open then z in will appear to be a short
if i keep on changing the frequency, you see keep on 100 hertz; 200 or 500 hertz
it is limited to a finite value only because of the internal impedance of the armature
and of course, sand, cement and water together gives you the cement motor, which is another structural material that goes into composing masonry
so there is an alternate structure of l f s r which is used more commonly for data compaction where, instead of using xor in the feedback circuit, we do like this: we use the feedback directly
there are no pending warrants etc
this is the correct scenario of operation
one is p, then one is n
and if you cross verify the the commercial interest they are more into voltage and current
so, as i said this, all actual arrival time values shown in blue here in this diagram can be computed in order: number of vertices plus number of edges
so, let us move parallel tolet us move parallel to this plane intersect p1 all the way to first generatrix here located by a red line
still what we get here is if we say that this is probably 400 volts, if it is 1 is to 1 i should have gotten 400 itself of secondary, but i am looking at phase to phase transformation
1, gallium arsenide is 1
now to evaluate this limit, we just have to substitute the total quantities in here
here we will see how the lithography can be done on, on this particular wafer which is coated with gold
but you see this one right, is even more complex, even more complex right see
we will take the easier one first, which is the second one
now, short circuit test, here k is equal to 2
so, i need a voltmeter or a potentiometer which is a near perfect volt meter i mean it is act with infinite resistance you can think of that i will connect here across these 2 terminals ok
25 into diameter of the bar into the permissible tensile stress of steel or 300 m m
4 it is your dw by dq is equal to v
so, static data member is also an object
so, then this is an ideal transformer the way we have represented everything as it this e 1 e 2 this is an ideal transformer that is written here, right
so, the answer to that is not clear just from the statement of the theorem, we will have a small exercise in the homework problem where you can work it out
that's why we have prepared the sales collection schedule
the absolute values of voltages are also important to maintain the transistor and saturation region and you have to pick that appropriately
alright so, now, let us move on the next module and we will look at is absorbing boundary conditions ok
this contact of the triangular area with the rigid support is of a finite length and that depends on how quickly the material will start crushing and that distance is taken as alpha delta t
so, they might have started the process, but then whenever they feel they have the right to withdraw
closing balance of the cash in the month of may is $29,000
two f by d x square is equal to one over c square
so, i have put an absorbing layer because i wanted to improve boundary conditions very good
so, when we talk about the different branches of accounting you must have heard about you must have this much of the background i am sure that there are the three branches of accounting financial accounting cost accounting and management accounting
so, that is why it is written this is actually satisfied
so volume is nothing but a times t, so 0
so, is v is 5 volt
so, this will be equal to 10 milliampere, so that means, the pointer will go to the extreme right
it may be possible that when we reduce the price of the material from 2
but in case of the unskilled workers this has become negative and the efficiency of the unskilled workers is at question and they have not contributed as standardized as was anticipated
so, here if you apply that outgoing this ah i 1 is entering at point p and i 2 and i 3 leaving point p, right; that means, i 1 is equal to your i 2 plus i 3, right
from q', let us locate this 120 degrees and let us call this point as r'
so, any amount which is spent for change of location or change of condition, then that can be added for calculating the cost of inventory
so, for first mesh if you see the current which is flowing in this particular mesh you can apply kirchhoff voltage law and find out the governing equation of this particular mesh
so, in the sales we will calculate the sales value variance, we will calculate the sales price variance and then we will calculate the sales volume variances because value is depending upon the price and price also depends upon the volume of the production and sales
so there is a total eccentricity, one is contributed by the eccentricity of the load, the other is contributed by the deflection of the wall itself
52 kilonewton okay so total vertical shear we got this for which the girder has to be designed and lateral shear will be lateral shear we can find out lateral shear will be simply if i make proportional that is 9 by 243 into 465
till then you just read once again, whatever i have taught and i will see you in the next class
there is some kind of miracle solution is going to come and solve everything
in the real life organizations also what happens that is the first they develop the standards, workable standards i can say attainable standards after taking into consideration all the factors and then they mean get the actual performance when the firm goes for the actual production and this committee which is appointed by the firm for the review of the performance between the standard and actual between the standard and the actual they try to find out these variances that what these variances are the values of these variances and then they try to find out the causes for that so that next time these variances can be checked, can be plugged and our standards are more nearer to the actual production or by subversa
now question arises, i have already discussed this part with you during the budgeting process but again let's recall it when to investigate the variances
so, at this point, we have 7 volts across it and 200 microamperors through it, and we want to replace it with a resistor
the first question is; a vertical line perpendicular to both vertical plane and horizontal plane
because of the cultural variations we find that certain other ways of greetings are also popular
it's important to be able to write it in terms of that stress because we know that the brick unit will fail in tension
so, now non inverting schmitt trigger ok
now, you see that example 2, it is very simple data everything is given
so, we can go ahead and calculate the intrinsic career concentration times exponential minus e g over kt
i have sufficiently discussed about the cost sheet and the relevance of the cost sheet and how the cost sheet is prepared
and this part one has to construct by division of equal number of things
now the question is how to define this regions like
for instance if i am sitting next to you and you are over here my leg is crossed with my toe pointed toward you that is a signal that i am interested in engaged in what you are saying
switch is
no, absolutely not, we do not care why mems is using a sensor we do not care
then the adhesion would be better
i am saying that whenever the clock edge comes, exactly the input will get stored in the flip flop
and then there is the problem with methodology
so, you got to be very careful but when you do it right you can get lovely images like this, this is my favourite image at the minute this is from limestone calcite clay cement
so, let us see the manifestation of this nonlinearity in how does it affect us, we know it is going to affect us, but how it is going to affect us
then the momentum coming, coming in per unit area, per unit time would be u
so, your conductivity equation which is n e mu e plus p e mu h will be just p e mu h and once again do the numbers the case of silicon mu h is around 450 centimeter square volts per second
and this is approximately equal to vs if r1 parallel r2 is much more than rs
so now we will proceed further with this part and we will learn about that what is the standard cost and what is the standard costing
that is absolutely correct, that absolutely fine no worries about that
topography of integrated circuits of semiconductor chips, they could be a registration for layout of integrated circuits
5 henry given, so l l into din 1 by dt
just write gamma into cost s zero, s i plus cost of s i s j
so, conductor they are conductor can be represented that is a long wire represented by cylinder right
so, at the lintel level you will have connections between all the walls and at the floor level, at the roof of the floor level you again have these beams which are referred to as bond beams simply because they are trying to bond the orthogonal walls together, the different elements of the structure are kept together using this sort of an element
usually what happens like i am using a ‘but’, so that’s what comes in the way, it gets in the way and that could be the challenge that you have to overcome
135
we have already seen this in earlier example, in the print example we saw this that you can always call the inheritable function form your parent directly by using the class of a parent
so, we go to the next slide, what is the next slide
deposit with bank with less than three months of initial maturity
so, the utilization due to the foreground task is 50 by 100 or 0
for instance, if we say p is equal to point 3, 2; then 3 will be passed as a, and 2 will be passed as b
so, when i start from here what will this function look like b is 0 right
so, the next thing that we need to do determine is the address of system and what exactly is this particular pointer
it is a very important dimension because acceptance if you want to increase among us all the employees at every level of the firm, we will have to make this as a participative budgeting
so, what i gain by doing this
and we can change the position i mean the phase angle of this v out with respect to v in by moving this knob or dial
so its like a one to many broad cast fan out
so from the design rule i can directly convert my stick diagram into my layout
and if you fill the entire screen with too much that is there is text on screen which is too much, there is audio playing in the background and the videos also playing somewhere down, where do i know your multimedia principles tell you this that never have all three together, audio, video and text right
so i am going to use another identity which says curl of b is equal to j of r times mu zero and therefore j of r can be written as one over mu zero curl of b, and therefore this work i can write as one half the volume integral curl of b, dot a one over mu zero here, right, remember, we are taking these steps as we did in deriving the electrostatic energy, where we kept converting the integrals, or the integrals over charges, into integrals over the field
it's going to be 51,500s
it is not a loan, but the deposit is likely to be paid after two years, three years, four years, etc
8 millimeter square and ymax we can find out ymax will be this one 312
that is not the case here
so we will come back to this again the continue with this problem
it is asset like a mine
this is small e x small e y small e z these are scalars they have nothing to do with any physical constraints similarly this del h i just write it in slightly smaller a notation 1 by h x 1 by h y and 1 by h z these are the new operators ok
and what about 4b
let's see how to solve the unbounded priority inversion because this is the difficult problem
we cannot actually edit or write on top of it but we can just download it from sites like libgen
d is less than 2 by 3 minus alpha, then steel is also in compression
so, if your what you call if your 11 volt about 11 volt you supply a rated current that is the full load current that 2
the question is, we have asked n to be 7 then we call this function n became 17 inside the function is n 17 now or not
so, are you ready now to prepare the cash flow statement
this is the 1st edge, 2nd edge, 3rd edge maybe the vertices are v 1, v 2 and v 3
so, if i am projecting that onto horizontal plane there is a 30 degrees thing
then it is february and then it is march
we will need to consider it because we are following indirect method
if i look at my total field formulation over here well let us look at the right hand side over here right
this is how it goes
and current through this circuit is i, and this is the terminal a and b these 2 terminals are given, and across this terminal it is connected in series and one voltage source is there v and polarity is marked plus and minus, right
you want to create your floorplan and you want to create your own design with respects to the rooms, spacing and so on
and i t is equal to because i 0 is equal to your what you call, i 0 is equal to 0, then for and then it is v s upon r 1 minus e to the power minus t by tau if t greater than 0 and if we assume the initial current i 0 is equal to 0, this is equation 76, right
so, i am just giving you information right i am not deriving it for you ok
in principle five cases exist for this projection of lines
you can see the top layer is photoresist
so what is important for us is this x 86 supported instruction known as clflush, so this clflush instruction takes an address as input and flushes that particular address from all the caches present in that system
so, square is much smaller
so, this is our equation in the absence of object
so, k ie, ie denotes the incident over here
4 roughly
the length increases, we said l by mu a is the overall reluctance
you may find that the actual arrival time is becoming greater than the required arrival time, so there is a timing violation there
it will be v angle 0 degree
so, we have so, three possible solutions ok, you can call them as give there some names this point as a, this point as b, this point as c ok
so, therefore, i f is equal to v upon r f plus r f dash because this is the current i f voltage this is a parallel circuit
so, this network would be linear 2 terminal was you want 2 short circuit these 2 terminal and find out the value of circuit current
classes are templates for data types and objects are instances of these classes they have a concrete data types which we use in our program
so, this at that time i is equal to il
now, i have to slowly vary the load note down what is the terminal voltage versus load current
so, it is necessary that though we are not paying for depreciation in cash, we should account for this loss which is not a cash loss but it is a loss of value of asset which is for generating this revenue
so, we have a small magnet which we can hold on top of it so this is a magnet so this is a small magnet ok
the rotor is not having rotating flux electrically; it is because the physically rotating poles
the first point is that how do we really develop the schedule when the number of tasks become large, like slightly non trivial application where the number of tasks are, let's say, 10 or 15
so this is consistent
but just asking this question that suppose a task set fails the liu leyland's criterion and also the liu and lehochki's criterion, then can we safely conclude that the task set is unschedulable or is there a chance that the task set is still schedulable
or even going to a place of worship and narrating the problem to the god or in certain religion where you have an option of a confessing it to priest or somebody in the place of worship
it has 3 of these amino groups which are present here also few of these amino groups present here also
so, let us construct a 5 mm radius or 10 mm diameter
you have given an unsigned integer n
you achieve this by extremely dense packing of particles, make the micro structure so dense so that the particles are so closed to each other stresses are transferred very nicely
so, 8 is clearly the limit, the question is whether we can actually put 8
so for alpha will get two, beta will get one, gamma will get two and delta will get
so, this gives us the huge advantage in terms of being able to write very compact algebraic kind of expressions by defining our own operators for our own type and the that the length that is can go is huge
then the second condition: maybe you optimize the worst negative slack max w n s, whats
in these type of researches we would find that the true situation of gender roles, the stereotypes etcetera have not been objectively viewed
so, what is the standard cost of the material
and in face to face classes we even have much more complex tasks like projects which may or may not be part of e learning, but essentially there are many activities which cannot be automatically graded using a single correct or wrong answer
now, now, by current division rule, you can again find out what would be the value of current i, so we will follow again the current division rule and we will say that the value of current is again 1
so if i go into home and do control h or alternate hide, it will show the hidden files with the dot prefix
so, one day one of my students told me, sir, i have survived today because of lightning; so, what happened
in the previous classes we learned about the basics of management accounting and the cost sheet or the statement of the cost and learned about that how to prepare the statement of the cost, what is the purpose of the statement of the cost and how this information which is generated by the statement of the cost can be used by the managers for the important decision making
we will conclude the part on the masonry materials and properties examining the different strengths of the constituents and the assemblies by looking at masonry in shear
similarly, we have this object, which can be bolted at this four locations and it has this cylindrical portion
so, if one value it is like 5 depends on 3, 3 depends on 1, and 1 again depends on 5, because there will be no way to actually resolve this right
patents require registration and for filing patents there is a series of steps that the ip centre has to involve in before a patent can be filed
this part we will see it like vertical
now if i implement it as a member function naturally since there are two classes involved here o stream and complex i have two choices for member functions
so you see that here, using all these test modes, your able to, ah, get a some kind of a board level in first structure where you can test the individual chips on the board
so if we provide 6 number of bolts then we can find out the length of splice plate so length will be if we provide 6 number of bolts that means it will be uhh 2 into pitch is we have considered 2 into 60 plus 2 into 35 right
whenever we have this true shape, true lengths other views always be parallel to xy plane
so, it will be your it is l 2 henry and it is r so it will be 0
first we saw that is your purely resistive circuit, then we saw purely inductive circuit, then we saw purely capacitive circuit, step by step we are moving
so, that means that we need minimum three independent equations to solve the circuit
okay, so this is what is the crux of a lateral load resisting single storage structure in masonry, in load bearing masonry
next, ah, after this, we will come to the algorithm
so, using physically unclonable functions, it is not possible to actually clone a device and therefore, you get much better security
23 sin this is the maximum value 13
this is essentially because of the internal drop that is taking place within the machine conductors which are manifesting a resistance of ra
now you see there is a circuit given in this figure
we know that this is current it and current say il which is nothing but time dependent current
if tower is tall, it can also happen that, but otherwise when footing resistances are high this may happen; so, this is lightning stroke and on the conductor
this bits correspond to the input polynomial x seven plus x three plus x one, and the remainder that is coming, that is, x three plus x two plus x one, which is supposed to be the remainder
that is, whatever it is written here right, whatever is written here, this is we are putting z l
you applied 1 volt and 2 volts as the input signal of this differential amplifier
so, we can use the names that python internally uses for types also as functions to convert one type to another, for example, if we have the number 78 and we want to think of it as a string then the function str will take its argument and convert it to a string
so, today we are going to discuss the cash flow statement and we will also take a look at a few cases involving cash flow statement
so, this is done as follows, first we need to get the pid of the hello world program
but let us get back to this the first question which i asked you how you chose n right
so, e c minus e v is nothing, but the band gap
so whatever the larger network outside the area of your study is present you will simply equal that network which is outside the area of your study by thevenin equivalent
obviously the induced emf will oppose that
no, the i continues to live on the surface of the conductor because that is where it is that is its support the surface of the conductor right, i am enforcing this equation at the observation points which is my choice
so, i am going to make a write a shortcut for this i am going to call this capital phi of t comma h just a shortcut
so in this way you can analyze the circuit if it is star delta if it is in the star delta combination
ok, so as i had said, once we have calculated the required arrival time and the actual arrival times for every point x in the circuit, this may denote the input, a gate, the output of a gate, some pins
so, this value is equal to we substitute all you will get this expression here you will get two values of s here, one may not be feasible, but another is your another is feasible right
second term the last term
let us be clear about what is an activity
this is phasor quantity say i l angle minus 90 degree
similarly, when q g negative it is actually leading it is lagging power factor generation it is unity power factor generation and this is leading power factor generation right
so, if you apply kcl at this point it will be your ah your what you call this current is also leaving this current is also leaving this current is also leaving the node
whenever the scheduler starts running, it looks at all the tasks that are waiting, finds out the deadline of the tasks and find out, finds out which is the shortest deadline and then it starts running that
yes, so this is at 870 rpm and at rated excitation hopefully because we are not taking anything about variation in excitation
so there are a set of bodies which are attached to springs
so, let us start with intrinsic silicon
initial conditions on the field i can set to 0
so, the occupation probability is 0 also at any temperature when e is equal to e f
there is always a prior knowledge or a prior art or a relevant art for the invention, they could be description of prior art
so again the process procedure to find out the stable or unstable region is the same as that the case we dealt with the output stability circle
so, you are actually protecting the steel with the zinc
in this case there is no base class constructor being called that does not mean that the base class constructor will not need to be called
now we will look a little more detail and we would see how one process can leak secret information from another process
but ultimately if you have a consider the loss you are what you call power and loss both then it will be act there will be your decrease will be in exponential way
so, r thevenin is equal to your 16 plus this 40 into 60 divided by 40 plus 60
now accountants were required to furnish the completed accounts to the head office
and the output of the integrator can be seen with the help of oscilloscope it can be cro it can be dso
so what we are saying is that to speed up the circuit, what the proposal is, that this was the hold line
so, with respect to this view we have to construct a 60 degrees line
it can deviate very very little
5d from the support phase but as long as the support reaction causes compression in that zone and if there is no localized compression providing the beneficial effect of compression to shear you cannot use this distance of 0
when you include stdio dot h, you are actually including the function prototypes or function headers
so, therefore, w m is also known i am going to choose it
it is working well and good
so, if you scare someone or tell someone something that scares them, they will usually make this face
so, 1 kilo ohm is here when 2 kilo ohm will be somewhere here between 1 and 3
so carriage is also the part of the cost of purchases
so, what happens is when i send a wave through this medium, every time it encounters different refractive index or different permittivity that wave has to undergo some kind of scattering we have seen that
so, when if you are compiler is using operator new, then your operator assignment should be overloaded
so, for an intrinsic semiconductor n is equal to p is equal to n i
2 kva 220 by 110 volts transformer, repeatedly whatever we had used earlier, i am just using it again
2 right that is your 32 volt that is your 32 volt right
you wouldn't be providing anywhere close to that for structures which are two or three story reinforced masonry structures
so, it is 0 at x 1 and then goes to a value of 1 at x 2 e right
so, in the case of intrinsic semiconductors n, which is the concentration of electrons is equal to p, which is the concentration holes and this is usually denoted as n i
but when we look at gate to gate, we can get reliable assurance of the data that we are using for gate to gate ok so this are the two ways mostly that calculations of the sustainability in this, so that the environmental impact can be done
so, now another point is that, when we are using crystal it has a, it has a lifetime
well, even saying that, instead one, two, three, four, five, six, lets say we use a numbering scheme like this: one, two, three, again one, two, three, again one, two, three, and this order
finally, python offers us a very useful alternative clause called else
so, it is in this decade of 1970s that the maximum understanding of the impact of chronemics was being talked about by various research scholars
and you can look in the literature many, many details of these studies
so, almost same thing; but leaves the bus voltage magnitudes essentially unaffected
5 ohms
in this case, what we are trying to look at is from this view we are trying to look at
observe that the inductor is always connected to the pole both here in the boost converter and also here in the buck converter the inductor is connected to the pole
there will be a minus 1 over that yeah
the image filter technique that we are discussed in the previous class they are also to some extent synthesis
whereas, instructors 3 says that i would like to use more sophisticated technology in my content and would also like to cover more content through the same
what we are saying is that the drain current of the moss transistor id, here let me rename this id, we want to make it equal to id or i 0 equal to a given current i i
so, let us try to change the value of the variable
so, the top part will be removed and bottom part can be visualized, so that we will understand what kind of electronic components are present
supposing you know, don't want such a high bandwidth or high a bema width, you can actually going for a spot lens, and what madhuri has in our hand is a spot lens which you will have to actually hold, ah against it, at a, at its, at a con, at a, at its focal length, student, yes, at its focal length, so that it is able to concentrate and give us a signal
so, let us see what was the mason’s rule
now, let us look at what we mean by the word property and now we just had a short understanding of what we mean by its rights
5 second, so v at t is equal to 0
based upon this, all this materials silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, cadmium sulfide are semiconductors, zinc oxide is closed to this value of three, but it is on the higher side and silicon dioxide is much higher
so, there is no other way than to keep a copy of that value, which we have assigned to z here to get that value back
let us just select this plane and say the top plane
if i go very far away from the object, what term will dominate
it is very large here, opposite in direction to the acceleration, smaller here, even smaller here, even smaller here, becomes zero at theta is equal to zero
in this lecture we shall be talking about some of the design considerations in embedded system design
so, you can think of this as this equal to sign is sort of dividing the present from the past
as against on the right hand side you see that the slider bar and the content is so nearer to each other that people have no confusion about like which is the one for brightness and which is the one for contrast
7 into 8 0
so what is going to happen is if i am having a star star connected transformer, neither the primary is grounded, nor the secondary is grounded, in which case especially when i am initially energizing the transformer i just turn on the power supply i have not connected the load
so, the previous circuit was like this
so, we can calculate the critical angle for total internal reflection; theta c comes out to be 70
let us say that the value of a is equal to say 0110 and the ith bit we will take i to be having a value of 2 so we considering the bit fault model and therefore the attacker targets this specific bit for example he would focus his laser beam on this bit and change this bit from a value of 1 to a faulty value of 0
while it is good to be aware of the cultural differences which exist and one should be sensitive to them
so, here we will change the output from positive to negative
so instead of voltage source across these two terminals you will apply one current source
602*10^ 19 by 1
and this n is there this is the speed of the rotor which will which will be less than the your synchronous speed ns right
so, we started with the surface approach first what
there are also 6 analog input pins, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution
finally, what we have seen is that we can nest functions
there is eclipse
if you actually look at the kind of rotation that you have of the slab with respect to the rotations in the wall at the interface between the wall and the joint, it's instructive to see that the total rotation is affected by how much rotation the slab is going to undergo and how much rotation the wall is going to undergo
ok, so these kind of adhoc techniques you can imply in various blocks of your design, some of the very popularly used methods i have discussed and some more we will be discussing later, so you can try and reduce the power consumption
methods are not important per say rather their research question is far more important, and you have to have a good understanding of the methods, their appropriateness, their limitations, and then you choose the method which actually suites your research question
example one: i will take: a straight current carrying wire of infinite length
so, if you have more than ah two or more generators then everybody will try to set its own setting, right
propagation delays means staring from the clock edge: how much time is required for the output to change
this is what the compiler does
then, draw a locus line somewhere here
so, this is not right front view, possibly the front view might be in this direction
in this video we will be looking at module 0, okay
we have reached, the node temp is now pointing to the last node in the current list
and how do we sum two currents
and if i take a loop like this where this distance very, very small, delta z almost into zero, then b dot, b, l across this loop will give me, if i take a length of this loop will be a, will give me two b, a and they should be equal to current enclose by this loop, which is going to be i
now, we will use extrude option to remove these cut portions
microstrips are often used for implementing these matching networks
so, we usually show that radius from outside through leader line with 10 units and center of that arc is this 10 plus sign
use a distance of 1 to 1 prime whatever this one as the distance from focal point f try to make an arc which is going to cut this 1 1 prime let us call this one
then when i apply the divergence theorem to this volume over here, how many surface integrals will i have to take care of
45 both the things
let us expand the diagram a little bit more
to understand how the stack is manage we would have to know about two registers, one is the stack pointer register which is denoted as esp and the other one is the frame pointer register which is denoted ebp
so across c2 you have a constant 3 volts
so when we say we are doing partitioning, we are essentially decomposing the system into smaller and more manageable subsystems, such that each of the subsystems can be handled, designed and laid out independently
so, more you know about porthos you can actually get more solution
so you see, initially i have told this is during the project planning or this what requirement specification analysis phase, then design will come, then coding will come
so, to fabricate this particular sensor right what we need
so this is how we can classify
it will be simply r e 2 per unit right or and if it is a lagging power factor, it will plus this term
ok, so this is you can
now, we will look at a new thing named aligned section
so every time, we find a sub problem which is smaller than the current value that we have seen then we replace that value as the new minimum, so that is all that is important here
if i still keep on increasing the temperature then what will happen aluminum will start evaporating
but, his brain tells him that, boss right now i do not want a slap, hide the copy
we have seen that that it is the input offset voltage which is more responsible for producing the output offset voltage rather than the input bias current right
let us move a little bit ahead with this
now, next we will try to see that is it that i can a default the parameters of a function in any way that i desire, or there are some basic rules or restrictions that we will need to follow
now to evaluate z11 and z21 you can find the values by connecting a voltage v1 or i1 to port 1 with port 2 open circuited, then what you will do
this as i mentioned was is also known as the mathematical form of huygens principle
and brings it lot of strong concepts into the existing features and still maintains complete backward compatibility with the earlier c++ 03 language
so, this is my phasor diagram right and similar way, if you move similar way, if you move, you will see that your z c actually is equal to omega c by 9 angle minus 90 degree in this case right
this is power plus this is voltage current here in the in the case of current is leading
so, tan theta this is the slope
so, the numbers beyond 9 are usually written using a, b, c, d, e, f
we use some of your graphs and images and pictures in our classes
so, it will either be attracted towards the permanent magnet or it will be repelled from the permanent magnet depending on the kind of current we are passing, and there will be a vibration this is the basic idea
now; that means, that when my v g s is 0 volt, what is my v d s
and these are a smile, wide eyes, lifted eyebrows; however, we would find that these physical features even though indicate what is normally perceived is happiness
for you directly you can understand just by keeping the r3 equals to r1 parallel to r2, we can solve the we can solve the issue of input bias current easy super easy right
you remove a small part of the medium, very small part of the medium, good enough that it just mildly covered the top, and then you introduce your motor neurons
so, sources many cases power will be delivered and power will be absorbed
8 right newton per millimetre square so the pd value i can find as pd is equal to aefcd that will be 3459 into 118
so, the position of the fermi level is related to the concentration of the majority carriers on the n side, it is your donors on the p side it is the acceptors
so, the controllability matrix will now have 3 columns
once assume you have designed your wall to carry axial forces, we looked at the prescription axial forces, both the steel reinforcement has a contribution as well as the masonry itself
student, including the electronics
now that is a variation, overtly you think that phenotypically you are black eyed person, whereas there could be possibility that the genetic makeup that you have basically has a recessive character
let us look at bigger one 8
if you see he has given square wave square wave at 5 kilohertz
let’s briefly pause at a reflection spot before going ahead
now all of these different types of malloc implementations originate from one specific implementation by doug lea you could actually search for doug lea and find the 1st implementation of malloc most other malloc implementations are derived from doug lea’s implementation
so, three fourth of load first of all i can say 3 by 4 times 150 kva, this is three fourth of full load and unity power factor means 1 is the power factor
the other way is use fillet to really reduce this short corners
if i have certain charge and density is rho r, then the force on this due to the electric field is going to be e times rho r and the power delivered is going to be v dot f, which is v dot e times rho r and rho v is nothing but j
so in a microstrip line, you have, if you take a cross section of a microstrip, which i showed in the previous slide
and this is a column for amount
and if it is and that means, this is only v s this is not required suppose v s
there are two additional what are called constitutive relation which tell us the relation between d and e, b and h ok
so we have to go for some techniques called design for testability, because almost all the practical circuits are sequential in nature
so, the n comes to the middle alright
another aspect which also could be treated as a negative impact on the society and its way of doing things is that the quality of concrete is not always assured
so, we have recorded purchases and fuel
any operation that you try to do, actually boils down to operating on the referred object or the referent
sir good
say, we want the ranges to the say this is one this 1 volt range, this is 10 volt range and this is 100 volt range ok
so, particularly electrostatic instruments cannot be used for a say dc current measurement directly as it is, because it is made up of ups set of two parallel plate plates
so, we will start with for example, the very early experiments which lets say maxwell, hertz, faraday, ampere all of these would have done and at that time they would have worked with real valued physical quantities, because that is what you measure in a lab
so, these are by default available for built in types like int, like a double some operators are available for pointer type as well and so on
in our understanding of proximity, the way we arrange our space which is available to us in a formal or an informal setting is also important
so using super position theorem all though you are analyzing multiple circuits by taking 1 voltage source or 1 current source on at a time but eventually you may get the solution very early because the circuits are now simpler as compare to having the multiple sources connected and you are analyzing that circuit
so, can we instead connect the ammeter maybe say here ok
5 and line to like voltage it is root 3 into v it is line to line voltage is given in the numerical that is your this value for that is 4160 voltage that is your 4160 volt
so, this allows to calculate only the line currents right, so star delta transformation at delta star transformation both are possible, if you fill you can convert it to delta to star star to delta
so, in this case , your what you call at this is a neutral
okay, so we have just calculated few important ratios here
no, why
so, we would hit the break point over here and then we would put another break point in line number 7
because of the means unequal length of the wires that are used to connect the two pins, and also variability in the parasitic resistances and capacitances drivers various parameters are there, the delays can be different and because of that you can have this clock skew right
how you can isolate these different cell types
49 and say here it is 0; click ok
if the generating station realizes many loads having shed off, then they have to reduce the amount of steam that they are pumping into the steam turbine right
now let us take another example where we demonstrate how unconditional branching can be done in rop
so there will be some fault model that is specific to a multiplexer, there is a fault model that is specific to a memory and so on
we will fix this
so, orthogonality will say that this is going to be equal to, so i have i have done the calculation you will get l by 2 is m is equal to n and 0 m not equal to n
so, but for the time being a de differentiated cell loses it is that unique capability of is differentiated state
ok, so for large designs it may not be practically visible to go for this kind of full custom design
let me again, for the lack of space, write this is r minus r prime cubed plus x minus x prime
so the most basic type of value that one can think of are numbers
so, what we needed to ensure was that we needed to ensure that this particular program is confined to a specific area
there is a delta l here and there is a delta l here, these will cancel off
so, when you see a graph, which is something like this
it is a matrix of size m cross n
we will consider only balanced thing
so, normally we follow the total costing system or the absorption costing system in a normal business situation, in a normal market situation, but sometimes when the market changes or the market dynamics change, maybe because of that some new players have come up in the market and say the existing players are facing a step of competition because market size remaining the same
so, particularly fixed type of capacitors it will remain connected to the system throughout the your what you call year of the ah your throughout the year right it is it is a fixed one it will, but ah in addition to that that that is at the light load level, but when load level increases
this terminal two is coming, but next terminal for two is up
so, things are very simple, only thing is that the right hand rule little bit you we probably apply for various purposes the right hand rule
in our first experiment we shall be using only d3, in the second experiment we shall be using both d3 and d4
and i want to find the voltage across the diode and the current through the diode in this circuit
then in the graph i connect them by a vertical edge which is showed differently
so this is the current coil 1 and i am going to have the pressure coil connected between the common point, which is common between the current coil and pressure coil and this is going to be the v
hello all, welcome to our nptel online certification courses on engineering drawing and computer graphics, we are covering module number 3 and lecture number 26 on orthographic projections
so, that total account of the funds that is kept in the cash budget or in the cash flow statement
your cost of just evaluating the matrix elements itself forming a x is equal to b is going to explode
now at this location edx plus 16 bytes, what is present is the actual address of this particular variable
but in general case, what we will be doing
so, tan inverse tan theta is equal to l omega minus 1 upon omega c upon r
some registered gi is include darjeeling tea, which is an agricultural product belonging to west bengal, aranmula kannadi which is a handicraft product from kerala, mysore agarbathi which is a manufactured product, coimbatore wet grinder again a manufactured product from tamilnadu, muga silk of assam again a handicraft from assam, orissa pattachitra which is a textile product from odisha
so, we will prepare that statement but before that our requirement in this case is to prepare the budget for different levels of production and sales and these different level of the production or maybe the sales and the cost and the operating incomes at the three levels that is the 7 million, 8 million and 9 million dollars that first we will be preparing and then we will be preparing the statement that is a summary of the performance comparing the master budget of 8 million worth of the revenue with the 7
so, this should actually read p+n not p and + it is my mistake because na is much greater than nd
so, what i can do is, i can essentially, i can essentially plot the right hand side and left hand side separately, okay, so there is some function on the left hand side, there is some other function on the right hand side, both are functions of vd which is my independent variable and i can find the point of equality or the point of intersection that will be the solution
for that your series r c circuit z is equal to this one r minus j 1 upon omega c right
if you take those precautions you can see here that the setting time was monitored for this cement during eight years and for four years it is not really too bad, not typically the length of a phd study
so, the in many practical cases a circuit is designed to provide power to a load, there are applications in many areas, where it is desirable to maximize the power delivered to the load right
i decide that before and then once i obtain that then i do the rest of the simulations with those parameters
whatever might be end of the day for one revolution this entire spiral covers 360 degrees and reaches the point oa
obviously, we use a lot of water in concrete we use water to make the concrete to cure the concrete, clean up and so on
we put the word in a sentence
so, in subsequent modules we will look at how do we actually implemented, but the hard part is over i ok
so, to summarize we will have one header file, which has the class that primarily should show the interface there should be one implementation file for the class that as the codes of all the methods and should include this
now to this if we have to connect a filter because this is a varying voltage we need to connect a filter it is a simple matter of connecting a capacitor like this as shown
so for te 10, the field lines, if i can draw them, the magnetic field are concentrate like this and the electric field are like this
that is a requirement under the law and if it has to be graphically represented, it should be capable of being portrayed on paper, and that is how you file your trademarks
there are a variety of compare instructions
the balance is going to the purchases and this amount is going to be how much
the second question is that ways we use the curl of b equal to mu, not j r, to calculate b for certain symmetric situation
and g is the conductance that is also per unit of the line that is multiplied by dx we have consider incremental length dx of the transmission line
the current here is 1 millie amp and the voltage here is 0
so, this is this is power system this is tie power we will see from where it is coming and this is delta p g 2 and this is minus delta your minus delta p 2, right
they are fixed in standard cell you can place the cells only in rows but in full custom you can place them anywhere
we have discussed four varieties of biasing a transistor at a given current i0 and central to all these circuits is negative feedback
in this case, you do not find that because this is only a mechanical invention and the descriptive part has described it
so, let us construct because maximum dimensions what we are getting is from this direction
you can see a, you can see b, middle
but i hope you understand the principle behind the experiment
similarly, r 2 is equal to product of the 2 resistor adjacent branch that is ra rc divided by rb ra plus rb plus rc
so, the last point we are going to join using a scale parallel to that we use our roller looks like
so we prepare the budgeted balance sheet also say that at the end of that budget period, maybe it's a quarter if it is a quarterly budgeting system in the firm or maybe it is a six month or annual budgeting system in the firm
so, capital i suffix is 0 right or we can write small i that is 0 is equal to that is at t is equal to 0; this is the current i all the time perhaps we are not writing it, but this current it is actually it right
so, whatever i said i have divided this domain into n capital n pixels and this pulse basis function is 1 in the n th pulse and 0 everywhere else right
but then how do we fix the deadline or given the deadline of the sporadic tasks
how you will deposit this metal
we have to analyze in detail that why there is a variance why we couldn't achieve but we planned and where but for the shortcomings and how we can remove those variances
so, check that virtual shorting is working; is true; then the solution point is stable check it ok
now let see if i calculate the field at point z, due to the line element here and a line element here, you can easily see that d, l cross r will give a field going like this
it is inducing in another winding
it comes from coulomb’s law which is 1785 and at that time electricity and magnetism
so, in this case the objective is to find the voltages of v 1 and v 2, when we get these values v 1 and v 2
and we had seen protocols like priority sealing protocol
so, that makes sense also because first you have to equate both the levels
so, if you want to find out the temperature of an unknown furnace or an unknown sample, by measuring the potential and then using standard tables we can calculate the temperature
we had seen for example if the system function present in libc was removed then the attack that we have built in the previous lecture will not execute anymore
so, it will be 1 over root 2 by root 3 by 2, which is 0
whatever the magnetic field is, this will be the induced electric field
first case is that when you have the network which contains no any dependent source so in that case what we have to do
it is going to make the power factor much worse, so that is the reason why induction machines cannot have larger air gap
so, average value 1 upon 2 pi 0 to pi i m sin theta d theta will be 1 upon 2 pi i m minus cos theta between 0 to pi right
63 volts per microsecond is about the wall typical value of 0
and then we press this upload button to upload it
this arrow means positive nothing is shown means negative right
so, she will have to write a main unified application of for all
and that was really the power of this displacement current term over here which maxwell was able to do right
from either side it will essentially cancel out with each other because the moment you write v rated by ‘i’ rated it gives you z base either from the primary side or from the secondary side and when you calculate the percentage r equivalent you will always calculate it with reference to the z base
darting eyes suggest the gaze in which a person enters the room and suddenly wants to check at what is happening in the room in a single gaze
but as soon as speed will speed will pick up slowly and slowly you cut down the resistance and being the resistance r is to 0
this is your if you looking, into this the diagram right here, tan theta is equal to your l omega by r, because i m, i m will be cancel
a non trivial example can be a task set in which the task is preempted before completion
now q 0 into q 0 that is q 0 into q 0 then omega 0 l upon r into 1 upon omega 0 cr
i mean if you if you neglect that this component this r i component
and then i b is 90 degree lagging, so we will have the i b here ok
so, this value actually comes from experimental investigations on different types of masonry
it has to be a collective set of nodes which ultimately lead you to ah, to give you this collective intelligence, because this scenarios that emerge when you talk about a collection of nodes towards getting to achieve something can actually add to the, the overall collective intelligence of the system
so, first i have selected that
the tlb stands for the translation look aside buffer has a mapping between the virtual address and the corresponding physical address so this mapping will ensure that once a virtual address is mapped to its corresponding physical address using the page tables that are present that mapping from virtual address to physical address is stored in the tlb
if we say like we had before that lcs of i j is the length of the longest common starting to i and j if a i is equal to b j it will be one plus the length start it from i plus 1 j plus plus 1
that is rupees 1
how much sales you want to attain or make in the market in the next three months from the january to march
and as ye'elimite is decreasing in amount, we see increase in the amount of ettringite
so, the diverter actually is a resistance which will be connected in parallel
so, if we do not want to use back slash, you can use a triple quote
so 1 2 3 4 in this direction, failure may occur 1 2 5 6 again, failure may occur 1 2 5 3 4
for the front surface, where x is equal to l by two plus two x, x plus two y, y minus three, z, z, d, y, d, z times minus x at x equals minus l by two
if you are trying to build a transparent semiconductor with gallium arsenide, we find that if you have light of energy greater than 1
it sort of becomes very complex, so laying it out on a chart like how we did it makes complete sense
so, therefore they cannot access the non static data like none of them can access the n pages data that may exist
row one is equal to q delta, if u like x minus x, not delta y minus y, not delta z minus z not
again small numbers right
now as we see here, the relation between the input and output of a circuit is linear, it is called the linear in circuit
so, t p plus b your what you call is equal to your 0 because a is equal to 1 you put a is equal to 1 here
so, this concludes the four types of bias circuits, that is sensing at the drain, feeding back to the gate, sensing at the source, feeding back to the source, sensing at the drain feeding back to the source and sensing at the source and feeding back to the gate
so, it says that it is possible that not in every case you will be able to do and implicit instantiation, but in many cases, you would be able to do that
25 minus rupees 2
so, its favorable to form h 2 when 2 hydrogen atoms come together you can also show this diagram by means of an energy versus bond length diagram
as temperature increases, the electron can travel faster which means the kinetic energy becomes higher, so becomes easier for it to escape the influence of the ionized impurity which means the scattering cross section s goes down
board of directors should not do partiality, that they will have some information or their relatives will have some more information, while other stakeholders are kept in dark
so, if you want to really specify some space has to be given use underscore button, so that that joins both the part2 and 2d thing
huygens principle we have not used it, we have only wrote the extinction theorem
rather, i would now like to show some actual, some of the actual resonators, microwave resonator is that are used
you will get a closed form equation because finally, there will just be polynomial i can integrate them substitute the limits and i will get it so
yeah, one grid here to one grid there it can be done, but that is again in one retrieve match to do it and that is done and that is helps us sometimes to get into the right valley, but these valleys can be sensitive supposing i started in this valley i reach the correct answer, but if i started let us say instead of starting here i started over here and then i move my go here
if i cannot solder it why is there an alternative arrangement to test the circuit
for a balanced delta connected load z a will be is equal to z b is equal to z c is equal to z delta equal
so, why it has happened because bhl also was not able to control the cost and if you are not able to control the cost and somebody else comes up and offers the customers a product which is better in the quality and say very competitive in the cost, why shouldn't the customer say shift their loyalties from the existing companies to the new company
one is black, one is red right
so this particular behavior whatever we get in the form of a plot between the flux produced versus current, that is known as the magnetization characteristics of any of the portions of an electrical machine, right
if you are going to use the main stand again this is something that is not aware of till i observed them on the field
in the previous case we found that the pointing vector is in the phi direction, therefore just goes around, you can see that it winds on itself and there is no energy going in or going out
so, the reluctance is going to increase further and further
so, what we measure here vsc, isc and wsc
front view after constructing it on the drawing sheet with minimum gap maintaining, top view one has to construct and after that we will see the picture the front view picture this one we will see, this entire curve projected like a line then again it goes to that point again we will see a line and this entire curve projected onto one single line
we are still looking at optoelectronic devices, but we are looking devices where we convert light into an electrical signal
once you get gamma l, you can calculate gamma in and then gamma s will be equal to gamma in conjugate
the important concepts here are one, preparedness
so, for example, if i use an op amp for designing a single condition circuit for a sensor, when no stimulus, it results in an output voltage correct that what does this mean, what does the above sentence means
depending upon omega naught
so, 2 pi r length 2 into 3
so, this problem you want going to face with this they will just you know you ensure that you buy the stuff and then they will ask you have to add up this oh you have to add up this
so computing in this way we see that the control of a on m is 8 out of 32 which would mean that 8 times out of 32 a has an influence on the output m, so this use a value of 0
note taking feature too, like their personalized notes
independent variable on the screen you will find it in a iv, and the dependent variable which you find written dv
ao is this one; ae is this one, this quadrant of that rectangle into same number of equal parts let us say 5
so say this is the r equal to 0 circle where r refers to, if i write the normalized impedance as r plus jx, and this is the normalized resistance and x is the normalized reactants
so, this is a representation that we will use for a binary search tree each node has three pointers and at the leaf’s we have an extra layer of empty nodes with all three values none, none, none
putting numerically something has infinity is a problem, so we need to work out the limit before we put it into the code right
it can be used much later during the test flow cycle and so on
so, thing for thing also a transformer is very simple
but certainly we cannot write the body of the draw function in the shape class, because we do not know the algorithm
so, he is saying go around the structure and find out where the nodes are that is a very crude way is there a smarter way
right now, if you see, when you see on the breadboard, what you can see
modality principle recommends that if you have a choice between on screen text and audio, use audio
now, what is viable
this is the definition of the instantaneous power
so, many many times that is the first thing you would code and that is useful like as a reference solution then if you want to actually use your code for some serious work it is better to switch to scattered field formulation because then you can keep improving your boundary condition right
have you guessed it
0051928 minus j 0
the the point is that, any version you use, you should know what is the dc power supply, all right
now we will have to check what is really this area
so, we will see in next few sessions that the, how will apply transfer function method in those cases
so, for example what would happen here is that there would be your memory axis which is done speculatively and data corresponding to probe array data into 4096 would be loaded into the cache memory from the lower size of the memory
if you look at the expression for te same thing you will notice happening over here k 1 z and e 2 z over here
so because of which i am going to have the power factor lagging
so, let us take let us take these update equations and see what happens to them ok
so, if i am discretising the volume i need to sort of use a make a grid like this; the grid is not going to be exactly capturing the object ok
so, part of this is done by the operating system and the traditional page tables and page directories which are present the remaining part is done by the hardware especially the sgx aspects of the hardware
don't confuse it with the self inductance that we saw earlier integrated over the curve u dot, d l
we can write a complete program like in python or in java without at all thinking of where these values are stored in memory, but you cannot write an operating system assuming that
in this course, we are going to learn about technical way of looking at drawing and trying to compare with artistic drawing also
we move to the profit in one more step
instead of that we project this entire object information on to vertical plane, on to horizontal plane, on to profile plane
ok, each edge will be having some weight
number 5, fake smile, grin
these are the things when we want to really construct a smoothened surfaces we use this
so, when i start from let us say let me start from this point over here and work my way all the way back over here
is there anyone secret about which is 0, 1 or 2
therefore, net output will be this 1 minus this 1 is equal to 73
now, so in this case, so preferred to high voltage side your re 1 is equal re 1 is equal to r 1 plus k square r 2 it is referred to high voltage side
similarly, cos omega t minus 90 degree will become plus sine omega t
which now sounds like trait like type of a term and he founded there are 18000 different words which can be considered as traits and what he did was that he classified traits in to 3 groups, cardinal traits, central traits and secondary traits
so, if you have to since the object will get incremented the value in the object will get incremented after this operation any way
so, with that, i would to close and summarize simply saying that the course on c++ is concluded
so, here you put i 2 is equal to minus 2 ampere and solve for i 1 so, let me clear it
so if i take the product one is ac into aw
so, this can be thought of as a like an an antenna array
4 million dollars cost variable cost was expected and in proportion to that if you bring it down this should be 6080 for the reduced level of decrease the level of performance that is for the 7
now in first case, what we are doing
so, in the so, far what we have seen in the fdtd update equations, the e and h are total fields right
that is what we have done precisely here
so, now the working capital figure is not given, although we have been given current assets and current liabilities
so, you may have studied this in any other course like electrical machines ok
ok, but this method, of serial method, unfortunately cannot be used in the event driven mode
that is the operating power gain and the available power gain for designing rf circuits
regular trade payables are is a very big amount
let us do that with another example
so that means, l into di by dt plus i r is equal to 0; that means, di by dt plus r upon l i is equal to 0 so or di upon i is equal to minus r upon l dt right, so integrate on both side
if i choose at this path and now apply stokes theorem, it gives me a dot d l over this path is equal to flux through the area
so, we will reduce it from o
77 microfarad, and the value on the capacitor is about 10 microfarad
so, c d line we already know this is c line and c point and d point already we know c d line
now say this i i is equal to say i m sin omega t right this is ac quantity
so, my synchronous motor, when i employ in a factory which is insisted with induction motors, i would be able to nullify any reactive current that are being drawn by the induction motor, provided i put a synchronous motor which is having excess excitation
to conclude, we will be dealing with masonry and behavior of masonry under shear extensively in a few modules from now
78 gives us a value which is greater than 1
i have not put it explicitly here, but still at this point the base class constructor will get called because unless the base class part of the object has been constructed, the derive class object cannot get constructed
so, while solving the transmission lines equation, we have come across 2 questions, one for the voltage and one for the current
so, that is why i need some a priori information
so, we have again cumulative and differential
add the dividend paid because dividend is going out for financing reasons
equation 3 did not have any k term over here correct there is there is only x y and alpha which is 0, but our original equation 2 had a k
so, now turns ratio is given 8 is to 1 means it is n1 is to n2 i mean whenever it is given that 8 is to 1; that means, it is n1 is to n2 = 8 is to 1
this is the way ah threads and special screw features we will show it
we have to realize this relationship using negative feedback
so, i am going to have ag times lg, is actually the volume so this is what we said as b square by 2 mue naught is the field energy per unit volume
in order to achieve this where we want to load arbitrary data into the eax register, we need to create our stacks which would look something like this way
initially the queue contains only the start node which is s x comma s y
so here we are targeting the detection of ah stuck at zero fault on this line, the output of the first and gate, so we call it alpha
so there are a number of heuristics which have been proposed that when you calculate the zero force location of a block or a cell, so if you find that the zero force location is already occupied by another cell, q, then the cell under consideration, let say p
so, as you can see, depending on the convenience and the way i mean you are able to use the tools, you can have a mix and match so you can take the best of both worlds, for example, in this case, right
so, let us erase all these marks and set up this thing as we expect
this is a tricky item
find it the over all
and for t greater than equal to 4 this one you got it because 2 switches were there, and it has been asked to find out at t is equal to 2 second what is the value of i
let me write these points or name these points as o, this is p, this is q, this is r and this is s
as we shall see it is also based with our cultural understanding, our gender differences as well as the power hierarchies within any organization
now why does this help
so, we have hexagonal pyramid and it is resting on horizontal plane
so this is a line element
during the time when the pole is connected to t2 it will be 0 minus v 0 so it will be minus v 0 here
another case where speculation is also observed is in something like this way, here what we have done is that we have replaced this jump on no 0 label instruction with a divided r0 by r1
we will use this default scheme that if we do not say anything we create an empty list
they are of course inverted and v input is rising we output is decreasing
this c1 and c2 these are ac coupling capacitors
for the probability of m one was a eighty percent, four by five
but here it is written here whatever i said here it is written here right
in generally, victoria kite is beginning just in time
so do you carry a notebook or a diary like you mentioned
but, several aspects of our body language are like old habits and therefore, we can unlearn these habits and learn more positive aspects associated with the kinesics communication
now what the attacker would do is he would first consider a bit fault model where during the execution of this rsa decryption h forces 1 bit of a to go from 0 to 1 right
now, third one is that the work done by 1 gear is equal to that of others, since there are assumed to be no losses
so, we already saw that when we have an inductor in series or shunt, we can shift our impedance or admittance and they will be shifted upwards in a zy smith chart when we have a capacitor in series or shunt, the impedance or admittance will be shifted downwards in the zy smith chart
so there is a tube of conducting material and magnetism dropping in the flux because of the magnet is changing and so a d current is creating in that ah two
we will come to it as you start calculating it will come to it ok
first, there was the trademarks act, 1940 which existed during the british time and there was also an indian merchandise marks act, we had already mentioned that trade in goods or services could also refer to merchandise; which again is a british act which existed in 1889, since 1889 and as we have just mentioned we had provisions of the indian penal code
i will add that back at the end of the queue
so this is what we would want to have
any conflict of interest should be avoided so same person who has say resigned as ceo or cfo should not get audit engagements then the corporate responsibility it establishes minimum independence standards for audit committees
therefore, it will become v m i m upon t 0 to t cos theta dt right
yes i am studying
12 and you can suddenly see that now the amplitude will start decreasing right yeah
so, the point is that when you have this inter digitated electrodes the impedance would be infinite because they are not touching they are not touching, all right
if you have not changed something which makes the condition false you will never come out
51 mm kind of units this extra thing what we call tolerances
so, we started trying simple things and it took me hell lot of time to tell a mother not to call his name
04 that is also 54
suddenly again is jacketed the same way the other things have been done
when we are showing dimensions occasionally, we write draw lines
so, all your questions about why partition happened, why people killed each other are all intellectual question which come later, first this is lump in the throat
alright, so this is the three line elements, area elements and volume elements in its spherical coordinates
the wet oxidation can be used for the field oxides
we are encouraged to use time wisely and at the same time we may also be cautioned not to be too obsessive about it
the unknowns are the inside and outside or only inside the integral sine
here these instructions do not produce any result in a register; this is what you should remember
today's assignment will be solved by shailendra kumar and anmol thakor
motor inertia is jm and viscous friction coefficient is bm
the chi they will not change, the chi belongs to the domain
so there should be no method at all either to read the value of top or data or to change set the value of top or data, and therefore there should be no set get methods on that
so, this is done by checking whether the ex or of the original data present in gs colon 20 is the same as that in the edx register, it would that the now if it is the same it would mean that there is no change in the canary and the function return successfully
the diffusion of source and drain
this is your now what you do is you put n is equal to 1, n is equal to 2 and n is equal to 3
so, this is what i am going to justify
so i t is d q d t is going to be the area of the plate a times d sigma d t
in order to do this what we assume is that the attacker has access to this particular buffer
almost 10 centimeter right there is no bending happening because it is 10 centimeter this is light will just go in a straight line, so that is what you see, but when you begin to shrink the size of the slit right
there by trying to understand that how do we perceive things, how do we make out sense how the world is around us
now what you have you have heater right, you do not have this metal you have actual heater, you have insulator, you have interdigitated electrodes
so, this whole term over here it will appear many times
so, here you see for a small region the input is above 0, so, output will be positive for the small region then it will be negative fine no problem
and we'll show you that by putting a magnet inside
they have authenticated with the help of their research that the random movement of the eyes indicate the background processes which are running through the mind of the speaker and then this is reflected through the direction of gaze
understood
rabindra kanungo they conducted very interesting study were two groups of students who belong to two dominant caste in the country brahmins and kayasthas they were given for lists of the first list of adjectives okay the fist list had adjectives describing brahmins in favorable terms like nice
we have seen what is alternative to that which is your breadboard yes in this breadboard, right
so we will look at both of them after which we will be looking at specifically winding arrangement in a dc machine
dollars, zero or nil will be purchased because our requirement is lesser than but we already have in the stock
so that is really not going towards any productive or useful work but it is establishing the magnetism in one direction and the reverse repeatedly
this might be something like a fillet kind of surfaces
that you will change the circuit to a norton's equivalent where the norton's equivalent would be looking like this here in this case you will have current source i n in parallel with one resistance r n so this is your norton's equivalent of the circuit which is linear two terminal
so, at v n equal to 0 v o will be negative
this integration is very easy carry out and i can write this as: sigma r square over two to epsilon zero times minus one over two z r times plus two
similarly, from c to b also 10 equal parts we are going to construct
so, after the heater after this particular process we have this nickel micro heater on which there is a insulator; there is this insulator on which there are interdigitated electrodes on which there is a sensing layer
second stage can commit its input before the output of the fist flip flop changes
what it does is in this resize function if we pass a value as we are passing through the variable count, then the vector will resize to the count number of elements
now, if you see this particular equation the right hand side of the above equation is known as homogeneous part of the state equation and next term is forcing function that is ut
that specific time when you were in hotel taj performing the commando operation okay what happened to you listen to this
15 into cos theta cos theta value is 0
if they are designed for 50 hertz and if it is a 4 pole machine, you have to run it at 1500 rpm
this is the amount which is repayable
so, specifically you have to use the arduino uno board from this particular list
so, we fake a particular emotional state with the help of our facial features
so, n is equal to e b is equal to actually v minus your drop in armature circuit ok
the problem is that due to inertia, due to the moment of inertia the pointer may overshoot that position
and similarly if and its own flux should be in phase with each other
i can have the reverse the double being assigned to i this will also allowed, but with a warning for the simple reason because double is a much bigger data type, whereas int is a smaller data type so, some data will be lost
also, depending on what the ratio velocities are, it can get reflected either with the same phase or opposite phase
has anybody done work like this before
let us look at the current through the inductor, il
so, this is fully known what is accompanying it
now we can use this net file
additional requirements on real time operating systems are memory locking support because in a virtual memory system the page is replaced if it is not used and therefore when a page fault occurs it can take a long time and introduce jitters
dependent variables are basically the changes that take place as a consequence of changes in the independent variable
we have already seen this
however there are multiple te and tm modes
now, in this summation, what i can do is i can introduce a new summation variable instead of, see this in the summation for psi m minus 1, my m is going from 0 to something and the way that i have written it over here now m is going from 1 to something
move to the surface
these three and also this r14 link register are stored in r13 stack here
that your this point this point it will start, this point it will start, and in that way that sin your what you call this current wave will be your what you call this sinusoidal one voltage also sinusoidal one, but at theta is equal to this this time your t or theta is equal to 0, current waveform will start from there because position is here and voltage will start from here somewhere here, right
so, you can do batch processing; that means, cost will come down
whatever it come right, because this is open, this is open
q bar this bar is the symbol for complement or negation
so, port 2 is the isolated port, so anyway it should be isolated, that is no signal should either come in or come out from the spot
but the point that i wanted to make is you can get a deviation from these curves if you use a different code and that comes specifically because of the fact that this is based on linear elastic distribution of stresses but in reality you are going to have a nonlinear distribution of stresses
so, such kind of lines invisible things, but still present we show it by dashed lines
so, i 2 dash will be i 2 into n 2 upon n 1 because n 1 i 2 dash is equal to n 2 i 2
if say there is no bypass current, then i 1 and i 2 prime will be same; i 2 prime is our estimate our measured value and this is it true current
25 this is becoming 189
in the same our auxiliary plane is in this direction
and on the other hand, if i have x and y then i can recover r as we just did for o distance it's the square root of x square plus y square, and theta so y by x is actually if you if you divided y by x you get tan of theta that is because it's sin divided by cos and the r cancels
so, so this 6 and 3 right, so if you look into that this is open
so i have added those two
the transformer primary winding is energised, when it is energised it is going to establish a flux, that flux established is phi m that is confining itself to the core and the secondary winding is linked with that flux because of which you are going to get a voltage v2 induced, right
so, if you have this kind of thing directly you can write this rms value will be under root of 6 square plus whatever value is come in this case pi by root to square
so, if you are for example, suppose suppose if it is
but on the three tracks we have laid out three trunks
now you also notice that the plus minus terminal of the voltage coil is connected to the line to which the corresponding current coil is connected
we had also looked at the cultural connotations of these zones
so, if they get destructed then the number of jobs will come down from 3 to 1
the places from where a, the places into which the outputs are going, because whenever your combination circuit, so you either correspond to an output or that output can go to an input of a flip flop
the tools in the inquiry learning space allows anyone to create inquiry spaces for their own topic, for their own content
so, with a little bit of reasoning you can see that the correct way to do this is the following
now, because of the long term investment involved the preferred model for institute which is looking at filing patents and starting up a new culture then it will be more viable for them to deal with external organizations on an adhoc basis
so, even for normal incidence the reflection coefficient is n minus 1 by n plus 1
the design of reinforcement, both flexual reinforcement, the p plus m design and the shear design is for the piers, for the vertical load resisting elements
researchers have commented on the speed of italians and people of the arab country and they comment that they speak in a faster manner in comparison to people of the us
25 mm
and the output signal is taken across the resistor
so, now we will use the maximum power transfer concept to determine the load impedance zl that maximizes the average power drawn from the circuit
so, this voltage actually this voltage your v right this voltage is taken v v and current is i
if we have an ideal inductor in series, then we see that we can go along in clockwise direction along the z smith chart
so, say some distance x, w into x is you are working downwards this is the conductor weight say if you consider the point p and between o and p this is the midpoint between o and p this is wx and this is figure – 4 and this is the distance between the 2 support
so, it's prescribed that the initial 5% be neglected and hence you take a cod model is that goes from 5% to 33% of the peak strength and get the models of elasticity
so, it is very easy right
today, the group of pentagon researchers his job is to study the movements and gestures of foreign leaders including putin
as i reach the rightmost like the two farthest points on the in the simulation domain i can fix before hand and say the dispersion form these two points should be no more than so much
so, this is what we got from the multiplication
so the voltage across this winding is v in
or if you want to keep it on the upper rail, you can use a pnp transistor or a p device
you can see i 2 is coming in and i 1 and 6 ampere current source are going out, so you can simply apply kirchhoff current law and say that i 2 is nothing but i 1 plus 6
when we are representing this a 1 to a 1 whatever connection, that is always be invisible
so thus we have seen how aslr works, so aslr requires modifications to the kernel, to ensure that libraries are loaded at random locations, further on it requires relocatable libraries which are located, which are made relocatable either at load time or by using pic technique, both data as well as functions are made relocatable this way
from an engineering point of view, the more interesting problem is what is called the inverse problem
we can also say that these tendencies are reflected in our classroom also when we are engaging a class as well as in other professional interpersonal settings
so this is more or less the range for which microwave engineering is defined
so yeah t minimum is it has to at least provide some amount of acceleration
so, for two winding voltage, i told you that this for two winding transformer this is 1 winding right
but when you are grouping d e, f, we find because of some constraint, d and e we can possibly bring closer together, much more as compared to f
so, if they are adding destructively, it means that no reflected wave appears at port 1 and all reflected waves appear at port 2
so how do i detect output stuck at zero fault
so, first one is vcc
so, when that happens people again get a thumbs up to come and try once more or simply socially just put it into social interaction
so to retreat what are the rotating parts the rotating parts are going to be slip ring along with that i will also be have conductors
so these are the two diffusion regions
so, in this equation, now you can appreciate the forward problem
so, we have to undo this move
so to apply cathodic protection outside is almost impossible, unless the strands are exposed inside the concrete
and your l is equal to n into l is equal to n into d phi by d i right; or in general, sometimes we can write l let me clear it
hall was to write periodically about time and the socio cultural relations over the next four decades and his ideas have encouraged other researchers to take up similar studies
96 into 10 angle minus 90 degree
so, we are into week 7 lecture 2
for example all those teachers who are unable to answer to a particular question by a student, would deliberately introduced it so that they would keep on listening with these non fluencies and it would give them time to plan
so, we can say that thevenin and norton's theorem are somehow related with each other with the help of source transformation
once you have heater you need a sensing material
so, we begin with what is called the needs analysis, where we ask why do we need to teach this content or in our case, why do we need to design e learning on this topic
so, we all studied these kepler’s law in school right
now, after the installation of 300 kilo hour capacitor effective q will be q l minus q c, so 307
so, if we are joining this line, it makes an angle in that way
a typical arbiter puf looks something like this, so we have actually multiple such switches present one after the other and a single input which is fed to both switches to each switch as shown in the previous slide
this is a scenario where a ta or teaching assistant is a student, she attends courses and tries to complete some degree, at the same time she helps some course in terms of tutorials assistance and assignment evaluation and so on
so, let’s say why is he distracted
so i am neglecting hysteresis saturation all those nonlinearities i am neglecting and i am saying that flux is proportional to if and it is in phase with if, that is it
so using these variables definition we shall now calculate what should be the value of the capacitance and also what should be the value of the currents that should flow through the diodes and such
now these put together the over strength factor, the ductility factor and the allowable stress design factor together is what we refer to as the behavior factor, right
now for 2 port network like this so for 2 port circuits, this is a noisy 2 port circuit various noise elements present
so, how you will solve
now every time there is load of store instruction from one of these codes either the secure world or the normal world mode of operation
so, because this is in the direction of the your what you call in the voltage rise
so this output voltage is actually now fed back to this point
for instance, people who dealt with cattle had a way by which they could earmark the cattle so that if the cattle got lost, they could identify that as the owners and claim it back
designing stuff you can do any ways with the text and graphics all that you can do, but when you create scenarios do not give generic things
so, we mark it in orange, and we just take the value from the table without expanding and computing the tree again as we had done before when we did the naive computation
you see potential force on the junction, potential force from the junction if there is n and p, what will happen the there is a random fluctuation in the motion of a charged carriers
and the phase difference between voltage and current i told you alpha minus beta here the power factor your cos alpha minus beta right
now, if i just want to blindly hide some symbols and just want them to interact between themselves i can put them in a namespace and not give a name to that namespace
so, because of some phenomena which was happened in the circuit we were having initially the current flowing i naught at time equal to 0 and this will be maintained because the current through the inductor cannot change
now, it is not a closed one
now lines in the graph are called branches and junction will be called as node
you may choose to select the appropriate mode of control for some appliances like the refrigerator, for which on off control is good enough
can you draw that picture if it is inclined to vertical plane line
we have this angle f 1 r f 2
however, if i go to microscopic scale, right, for example, if i go in charge density to very small scale, i see electrons, protons separately
then in such a case if i add these two i should get d plus d hat which is the d which is expected by the transistor so that is exactly what we want to do so i will do the following change here i will introduce a summer let's say this is plus and this also plus and to this plus i am introducing a small voltage source or something which gives you a constant and to that you are giving a vdc value which represents the nominal operating point so a voltage output which is coming from this and trying to modulate the pwm should correspond this will correspond i'm using correspond this is a voltage which corresponds to d plus d hat now this is what will modulate the triangle within the pwm and generate the get right now this term is called the feed forward term
and we have found a prime, so we must add it to the list of primes
then the first one what we are learning is opening a new drawing
so, you might have heard that a ct should never be kept open circuited
it could be through a series of questions, and based on the answers that you get you could ask further questions, the object is to ensure that you have all the information which can qualify for a working disclosure
so, what we do, we actually have provided two different constructors, one that takes two parameters and the other that takes one parameter
in this way by appropriately placing address of gadgets on the stack, we are able to execute the different gadgets and therefore we are able to achieve the sequence of instructions that a target payload had to achieve
to the external user, function must behave exactly the same way
density of states refers to the number of available states for electrons to occupy
now, where exactly we have this side view
now, the overall ranking has been there are specific ranking with regard to engineering institutes, but the overall ranking has placed; this is the 2018 ranking
once the material comes into the firm because purchase department job is to place the orders, identify the source, negotiate the price and fix of the place order
so, you have to write hertz, you have to write gain write always unit, always when you plot the graph, write units very important
so in this class also we will continue our journey on discussing the few important properties of the laplace transform
so let us start our discussion
so, these 5 functions have different argument types, but they are treated as one function having a common name in c++ and this feature is very powerful which will enable us to do lot of things called function overloading or as we will slowly understand an alternate name, more formal name for it is static polymorphism
now the peak to peak voltage start in decreasing
should not exceed because it is really challenging to an isolate the tissues and dissociate it
the point that i am making is that you can use this breadboard to create entire circuit, which you are looking at here instead of this pcb, create the circuit on the breadboard, and then test the circuit
if the eigenvalues are on the left inside of the s plane that means if they have the real component negative
you don't have to work with one value that is coming out of the structure but you have a range of results
so, with this we can close our today’s discussion
a simple definition of a capacitor is 2 plates separated by a dielectric or air
i know the gm value that i want so i calculate vgs and in our example it was 3 volts and for that the current would be 100 microamperors now the problem we are facing as follows when we buy many transistors or operate the same transistor at different temperatures i won't have vt to be the same and i won't have kn to be the same
so, what would happen you have an external stimulus, you observe the behavior and based on the observation you try to calibrate and this calibration helps you form the stimulus response association
7th week we will devote on circuit analysis using laplace transform
2 full load slip you know 0
so weber per ampere is henry
but, now say there is some noise which is added to the signal and therefore, so, there is some small noise which is making it like this ok
on top of that in support of object oriented programming, we introduced a whole lot of very important features like overloading of a member functions
the second part of the thing how to draw tangent to a circle from an exterior point; finally, we will cover how to construct a regular polygon of a given side
it mainly for this convenience that we can freely use the length of the list as the upper bound that the list stops, that the range stops at j minus 1
these were modular, that is the units had a proportion between the length, the width and the thickness of the units
for example, if we are picking something like a prism maybe a box in that way
so, that is why such insulation failure or preferably arrestor operation, establishes a path from the line conductor to ground for the lightning surge current
so the 3d as a whole tells us how to display the value there is going to be passed here, that is the first thing
so, vo is nothing, but kteln nandni2 , we can do all the substitution and the numbers
so, i can say that i of z prime i can break it up into n segments and over each segment i can say it has some constant value i n and some kind of a pulse basis right
in a stepper motor i will just show you crude structure of a stepper motor
now, when you talk about active filters, the circuit that employ one or more operational amplifiers or any other amplifier, in addition to the resistor and capacitors then that will be your active filter
now edge number 5 is shared as a reason i have taken phi is because it is more interesting it is common to both the elements right
lets call it capital n, and the faulty versions in presence of this faults
if we are looking at this pick any point on the curve
if we give it the string 321 then it should give us back the integer 321
facial expressions can also be sometimes controlled
so, this nonlinear two port, by the way, i could also draw the small signal equivalent of this using conductances and control sources, that is the circuit equivalent of be y2 v1, and i2 will be y21 plus y2222
if you try this it is not necessary that it will print this
so, if we start this, for instance, say 5 it will say that 5 have left a subtree
so, if you compare both of the analysis you will come to know that mesh analysis is depending upon kirchhoff voltage law and nodal analysis is depending upon kirchhoff current law but sometimes in both of the cases you might need both of the kirchhoff’s laws that is voltage law as well as current law to solve the circuit
so this is my clock activation logic
so, it will be your this equation this equation for this straight line will be your v is equal to your that your
5 or something, that is what i remember from what i calculated
initially this input a was coming to this single input of nand gate, but now this input a must come to two different places
so the insulations of armature windings would have been designed with the rated voltage in mind
we already mentioned that a metal line must be minimum three lambda wide
so, we find that whenever there is an unwelcome sound or even a stare or a scent we find that we are being violated in a space which is accursing to us
so, this circuit has some problem; i mean i mean when it when it comes to practical use this is a risk
we will pick a sign source
the plan of this course is that this first lecture we will start with some very basic introduction and then we will look some basics of task scheduling
so, if it is not there in the first place, you cannot have bluetooth
so how do we use secondary electrons, well generally we look at fractured surfaces, these are very easy to prepare you just take a piece of your sample, smash it with a hammer, pick up a little piece, coat it or whatever and put it in the electron microscope
so, and this sigma will be this term this part ok, the real part b by 2 a
take the calculator put it in hexadecimal mode and plus 1ab8, so what we see is that we get an address of 0xf7fd3000
this is not how maxwell wrote, maxwell wrote them in some slightly you know elaborate form
just stop by there, talk with that guy and you will see that you will learn something
so, this why we have to see first right, so that means, sign will be that mutual you are not required mutual inductance voltage generator that sign will be negative
you may see examples of peer review in this course also
but after some time into the execution it needed the critical resource here
the second thing is what is called this magnetic frill which it is like a ground plane and a coaxial cable sitting on top of it like a monopole
what is the boundary condition here
right so, in these methods what did we assume
the number of parameters that a function has; each parameter also called argument, we will have a type
let us assume that v1=2v, v2=4v and r2/r1=10
and i want to find the output resistance looking that way
if a resource is returned and that is equal to the cse, then all the resources are checked
so, that is the strategy that we will use
so in the last few lectures we have been talking about the clocking and the various timing issues that may arise in a design
so this will be the starting contactor which will be closed and if i want really this to be connected in delta, i will have something like this from here i will have one contactor, so this will be during running right
so, iph if we write the subscript here iph is nothing but the intensity of the photons that is falling on to your solar cell
and what is that
1 by
such was her health condition
i think there is one more point, like, the first thing might be selecting the book or the pen that you might have, for example, if you might carry, sam might carry a lot of notebooks, right
of course, this failure plane is going to be affected by the relative strengths that we have considered here, the value of cohesion, the value of friction coefficient, the value of tensile strength of the unit, the value of failure crushing strength of masonry and it is also going to be dependent on the ratio delta x by delta y
so, r e 2 x e 2 expression you know all this right so, this is your what you call the voltage regulation
now what we have to do, we have to apply the kvl
for this i consider a portion of gas or liquid in this which is here of length, delta x
will i have a x y term, only the x components get dotted with each other
so, for last two sessions we have discussed cash flow, i hope you have seen, you have started reading the cash flow of your own company
in the setup phase recall that for serial communication, we do not require explicitly any hyper terminal for arduino, but for stm we require that
universities also contributed in a way that the ip that protected the initial research could be developed into new products
so, low frequencies should pass and the frequency is calculated using the cut off frequency formula 1 /
so, this was the left hand side right; what happened with the right hand side
so on a substrate, p type substrate there are two diffusion regions, highly docked n regions i created
so, this is very useful we can really see very well the disposition of the different phases and of course the pore but as we will talk about in the next part the pores, we see are only really the very large pore so it is not so useful for porosity
m in rectilinear that is motion in a frame in which there is no external potential
and what is insulator
and then we have iron and at the bottom we have zinc, aluminum, magnesium
this is what we call natural method
so, exception handling is what is very important in terms of c++ as bjarne stroustrup's comment shows, it is a mechanism that separates, this is the key idea that it tries to separate the circumstantial exceptional flow that is flow that arise due to these exceptional situation happening from the normal or the happy flow that we have actually designed for
for example, if we have to appreciate a friend for something he or she has just done what exactly do we do with the help of our bodily gestures
for equation 2, the same logic will give me a different contour right
you can not take the magnetic flux as a output variable because you cannot measure the magnetic flux directly using any operation
we'll get on to the next component of material strengths of masonry, behavior of masonry before we get to design
and if your i 3 is equal to 4 ampere then v 2 is equal to your 2 into i 3 that is 2 into 4 that is your 8 volt right
but please note in the case of transformer it depended upon what kind of load i connected on the secondary side
because unfavorable is more than the favorable
this is the object what we are looking at is a stepped one and the dimensions are these continuous lines with arrow heads
so, what i am here
and tm waves are the converse
and now having perceived things i have learned things now, what after this
therefore, we can write this this equation that i t is equal to 2 minus e to the power minus 2 t is equal to we can write like this 1 plus 1 minus e to the power minus 2 t u t right
so, it has to a defined as const, so that you cannot make any changes to it
what is your intuitive understanding
but we can have the hybrid parameters which we will discuss in the next lectures
so, what we do is we assume the minimum as some large number and every time we see an entry, if it is smaller than the minimum we reduce it
so, this is the reverse saturation current density, to calculate the current we just need to multiply this by the area
the center of the arc is not somewhere inside the object somewhere outside
if we are doing it in one pass and we are checking if numbers divide both m and n, then why not we just directly check for common factors
so now let me draw a box around this circuit
since this color is not ok, let me write different color: x, y and z
we know if since n1 / n2 = v1 / v2 therefore, v2 = v1 * n2 / n1 right = v1 is given2500 and n2 / n1 is 1 /10
so, if you come here what will be your v c infinity right
so, our first step is to remove this from the queue and explore its neighbors
so means you are a designer, you want to fabricate, so the entire cost of fabrication have to be borne by you
now this is a bit confusing, so join is a function which is associated with a string
in the previous case we have seen that 10% of sales are on cash and 90% on credit
so, let me just brief you about another example
so now we have an expression that comes from the failure criterion for motor and using equilibrium and compatibility an expression for the motor and now an expression for the unit itself coming from the consideration of the linear failure surface in tension compression of the brick unit itself
another thing is i x this is a common node v 1 and this is your also common node v 3 right
we can move our eyes in different directions to suggest whether we have understood it or not
so we mix the cement with water
because this transistor is on; so you will get a 0 at this point, so at the pin you are getting a 0
but you see, in this design there is a problem with respect to power consumption
you notice that the contribution from node 2 was 0 so; similarly you will find that the contribution from interior nodes becomes 0 ok
this increase in the cost because of any reason is if you look at this increase in the cost is amount at any given volume of output by which aggregate costs are changed if the volume of output is increased or decreased by even one unit
now, let us first understand the modeling of mechanical systems
so, i is 1 1 square r into 8 actually it is 8 watt
all parameters are given it is we converted to volt per meter
so, i also have told you how to remember the circuit, you just have to remember this one and then for non inverting amplifier; that means, this input this will be, this will go to 0
so, you ignore this term also and for the phase term you write rho is approximately equal to r into we can use the binomial expansion over here and you will get a
assets you can see are more or less same
i hope you understand what i mean by phase sequence
so, remember this terms, if you see this circuit we have taken the circuit from electronic tutorials we have if you see here there is a signal v s, right
and one current i c is going like this, although i c is equal to ah minus thing
so, let us let see what we can do with this
so, non inverting amplifier gain we know gain is nothing, but a equal to 1 by r f by r i right
physical buffering means you introduce some buffers, or virtual buffering means you indicate that here you may require a buffer, but you do not introduce right away, you may need to introduce later
if i rewrite it differently in terms of the reactants 1 by omega c2 the reactants of the capacitor must be much smaller than the resistance across it which is rd plus rl
it is difficult and some variation in the parameter during fabrication can deviate this zero skew characteristics in an actual tree design, right
one is aerodynamic damping
so, abetak it clear not whether it is a shareholders funds or whether it is a liability
what are these major sections
so, just be careful and try to do it very close to the sink
and we see that once this is printed, sms is received, we display this in the serial
so, let us call this value h 1 ok, now there is going to be d y over here also this is going to be a d x over here also ok
if you talk about slag again you have something very similar to fly ash and if you have talk about silica fume actually the lower band is there is noöthe resistivity is much higher compared to fly ash or slag
so, here the variable of interest, is the scattered field ok
now, if you do this you see we get back to exactly the input files as it is without the extra blank lines because print is no longer creating these extra lines
because 400 by 50 it will be 8 ohm plus 5 is equal to 30 ohm
instead of t i am going to substitute t minus x over v and v
now before we go on to looking at life cycle assessment let’s look quickly at why it is necessary to assess sustainability and why do we have to give so much importance
single phase transformer is to have an approximate unit per turn of 15 volt, that is given and operate with a maximum flux of 1
so, one of the users of financial statements are taxation authorities or government authorities
so, what is calcium sulfoaluminate belite cement
in the 1st lecture, we are going to cover introduction to engineering drawing
in this lecture, we shall be showing you some more interfacing experiments; namely we shall be showing how to interface a dc motor with the stm32 microcontroller board
if i want this to be closed only on some instigation, some stimulation, i do not want it to close otherwise
these developments shall be influencing the way we live, we communicate in our daily life
so, let us pick somewhere at equi division 1 2 focus 5 6 and 7 points and there, we have to draw perpendiculars
here, we said that a prime number has only two factors 1 and itself
then, what is v infinity, then v infinity will be that is a steady state value, this is open circuit this i is flowing this i is half and it is 20
some of the incident wave will be reflected from this junction & say produce a wave b1 & some of them will continue with second junction say a2 & after reflection will be b2
now, we know that n s is equal to 120 f by p
so; that means, at omega greater than omega 0 b c greater than b l that is theta y that is positive right and angle of impedance theta will be negative
so let see that how it looks like here, the same example i am showing here
so even if he transistors are off, non conducting due to some see, the junctions can be modulus, some reverse bias diodes which are [vocalized noise] not conducting, there can be drain junction leakage, sub threshold current
i am sure ah you might have seen that in the newspapers as well that you know all these ah voice based command systems are quite popular, right
so strain hardening occurs
and then the value of s
as you can see here, there is a silicon rod through which you can push the wafer inside
it means what is the difference here
so, now it is very, very important technique, very useful technique and we have learned it that the budgeting and the budgetary process is the first and the foremost
it is also very good for looking at portlandlite if you are careful to avoid preferential orientation but tga is also good for that
you are assuming that the masonry is actually acting integrally but it may not act integrally
so you have to analyze the combinational block and find out what is the maximum delay you have to spend after which the output gets stabilized so that when the next clock is comes, the stable input value should be available here, of course taking into account the set up time constraint as well
so, this is your low filter low pass filter response
so, i sc is equal to 0, so it will be 4 it is open circuit right
however, let us just look at the case where if we were to provide web shear reinforcement for wall type c whether the web shear reinforcement that we provide satisfies the requirements of detailing
and, you will have to be careful about those
can you guess the object front view
just multiple, point zero four
from here you get gamma l
there are four variants of establishing a constant drain current in a transistor
so, this may happen that that, but this kind of vibration resonant vibration or aeolian vibrations right, have very low amplitude maximum may be 0
so, there will be another voltage coming from somewhere something; this voltage will be compared against these two levels ok
so, therefore what we see is that secret key bit k0 is then passed to the output, so the attacker would just need to look at these significant bit of cipher text to determining what the value of k0 is, so in this way the attacker has obtained one bit of the secret key
you go through life as if there is nobody around, we are just bugs on the wall
now area provided is this and l by rz we can find out and we can check the effective slenderness which is 10 per cent more in case of batten is ok or not
so, i am sent to the sports academy of the same school
so, the way it works is that there is an air current which comes down like this is force of the air current
now, next stage your another thing that convert delta network to an equivalent star network
so in both the directions there was compression and that led to another failure mechanism
the right may involve the right to print the right to publish the right to perform film or record the subject matter because, here is an expression of an idea and the all the forms of expression most likely which can be captured in a medium this is critical when you understand copyright
in other words what it means is all points outside this stability circle are potentially unstable
therefore, what is done in practice is a scheme call lazy binding unless a function is actually used only then will the address of that function will be resolved
now, the next question we will ask that is it good enough ok
sinusoidal
and broadly speaking this kind of touch sensors can be either capacitive or resistive
quite often we want to start with 0
so, this total charge q just let me let me clear it right
so in this example, for instance, you can map this part of the circuit into one l
what we will see is the top portion of the car of that shape we supposed to see
so, some value of will be there in the reverse direction that h value or you are reversing the direction of the current, at that time you will find that this value right your what you call this flux density right, this value you are slowly and slowly coming to 0
so now, wwhat you see is, you have a high pass filter, you have a low pass filter, you have the operational amplifier, you have the operational amplifier
if it is allowing the low frequency to pass and it rejects high pass, then it is low pass filter
so, each and every component, one has to draw it carefully which follows certain design practices and to be supplied to the fabrication unit or manufacturing guys
i may have a south pole here
they will yeah they will be retained, because in your design phase if the client is not convinced, but if you are convinced as a designer
for x, the delay of x is one and the delay of the input b, which is at time zero, is point one
how to prepare the cost sheet, how to prepare the cost statement, how to take decisions by looking at the different types of the cost calculated worked out under the cost sheet or the cost statement
the other thing is that because of this there may be functions which do not return anything useful at all
so i am again showing that picture, that i am concentrating my calculation within a time period of t, and within the time period t, the input or the output [vocalized noise], whatever we call in inverter, both will be the same will be changing certain number of times
we will talk once again about how to use this phase shifter in a ac potentiometer and then we will talk about another potentiometer which is coordinate potentiometer with which also we can measure ac voltage with arbitrary phase
these treaties also decided on the term what the term should be trademark unlike copyright and patents which have a limited term, trademarks have an renewable term
suppose a series connected load draws current given by this expression i when they applied voltage is vt that is 120 cos 100 pi t minus 20
5, because it is 25 milli henry by mistake i took it
at the same time we find that food and food related images are strongly related to our concept of territory and national identity
so, what i have got is this change over here d f is the dot product of two vectors and this vector over here is something which appears time in again
now because of the difference in band gaps we create this potential wells
so, let us for example, let us take this direction to be x, so again very intuitively if i asked you that for an object of size l how much do you think that this rate of change of the field, along that coordinate x
so, this is an additional layer of complexity that would definitely come in and therefore first being able to idealize rather correctly what the boundary conditions should be and if there is significant deviation from idealized conditions being able to estimate what those partial rotational translation restraints could be is the other aspect that needs to be looked at
my vgd will keep on decreasing right easy
how we can change the gate and how we can move from the traditional mosfet to finfets and so on
if you can catch them here, we can even address them right here
we only talked about different kind of sensors from where we can read the data, but now we want to also control some devices
so, it will be your xl minus xc may be r or xc minus your what you callanother thing will be xc minus your xl may be at two condition may happen right
the last sign which is displayed over here also may have different interpretations
so when you are doing your analysis, of course there is symmetry in the section, the symmetry in the loading, but you would be careful that you know which is the windward side, the outside part of the wall and the inside part of the wall and so it's based on that assumption that we are looking at a migration of the hinge towards the inner edge
similarly if you have a signal flow graph diagram like this
so ps1 by 4g1, this is g1
if it is in third quadrant they will flip
no, i mean i have just indicated by figure, but the triangle does not appear because i have kept h as h whatever h may be later i will write h in terms of triangles ok, but as this goes the this divergence theorem talks about the overall boundary
now, i do the same thing, but only thing is, i comment out the copy constructor
welcome to module 22 of programming in c++
the other advantage of these computer graphics is if one would like to quickly prepare a prototype it is quite easy to use these drawings; these days people are going with 3d and the advance is like 4d printing
while in the sgx enabled hardware the attacker would have to target small regions in the hardware or small portions of code in the application in order to achieve in order to gain access to the secret key so let us look into more details about how sgx actually works
whereas, the efforts on procedural aspects, there were certain treaties concluded and which only had an effect on the procedural aspect of patent law
these materials techniques are going to be similar to what we did earlier in the case of electrostatics
so, we will have to check that otherwise more largely the reasons seem to be uncontrollable and we will have to misgo with this
this is actually equation 14; this is your equation x 3 dot
once, done from different view we will be in a position to see this slant edge
ok, so false path can be identified by analyzing the functionality of this blocks or the modules that are there in the circuit
so, first solving the forward problem no problem, that is how i got my e r right
since, i am going to take a going to 0, so a is much, much, much less than r we are going to neglect a square term and keep only this term
a coaxial wave line, waveguide can be drawn like this
so, this is i naught, so now both of them added together, i should have this as i1, this is the overall i1
anything inclined to horizontal plane we can be in a position to see it in the vertical plane
so, this is a nice example to see that we need to proceed using the different functions of the stack to actually compute the postfix expression that is available to us
i have seen people use aluminum foils
so, this is nothing but a combination of first response and natural response of the circuit
kx minus
so, this is actually figure 18 this is the illustration of the insulation coordination between oilfield equipment, and surge arrester this is this called the transformer right
and suppose there is a delay in the product launch
because there is a material on this side this is the room air and this is the room material, these are the edges
so i am calling it the conflict of interest because lots of times the conflict that we see is between 2 humans, human actors or between a human and a thing, an object, an animal, i don’t know
so, this one should not be used
so, in this circuit it is i 1 minus i 2 right and finally, i 1 minus i 2 and that this i 2 this side is open
so, that word size is in whatever we have discussed they are eight bit word
but we quickly realized that it was producing too much current
that's why in this session i have told you what is annual report
so, solution how will do this first you have to compute the surge impedance of overhead line you know, first say overhead line say it is z 1
this is a development board, you can see this particular chip in any development board
6 million all other figures automatically change
how we can use multi meter
so, lot of this kids are disturbed by the environment, one small comment can disturb a teenager
and of course, again, these voltages and currents have to satisfy these relationships which define the non linearity
very easy experiment, extremely basic experiment, but important to understand
in the next class onwards we will learn more about these projections like; what is vertical plane, what is horizontal plane, how to visualize something in front view something as top view, something as side view and the directionality of these views
00
now since we have seen what the data sheet generally gives us right this is the end of the data sheet as you can see here what data sheet gives us is this particular parameters right including the mechanical comp mechanical dimensions, including the electrical characteristics right
now these equations and these derivations will be found in the in the notes accompanying this presentation, accompanying this course, so in case you have missed these in the lectures, you will be able to find it in the accompanying notes or ppt slides
mid frequency is the most difficult situation to handle because i have to take care of both these derivatives ok
and the first important observation is when we are projecting these lines onto vertical plane horizontal plane in this special case, the front view is a vertical line precisely giving true length of the object
we can see here source; we can see here drain right
there are certain dominant interpretations in every culture also; however, most of the times when i would be talking about the interpretations of our eye contact, i would refer to the dominant interpretations which we have in our country right now
so, so with this we come to end and to this module, in this module we have discussed about the various parameters used to characterise the linearity of a circuit and some of the techniques used to improve the linearity
and this is the secondary side that r 2 and x 2 and this is the current flowing through the load this is that your that ferromagnetic material primary ending secondary so, on and this is the load
capacity constraints service capacity is fixed for many firms depending on the type of service time labour equipment facilities or a combination of these can be a constraint for example time is a constraint for restaurant services equipment is a constraint for a fitness centre and facilities are a constraint for a school or college refer time: 03:58) understanding demand patterns we can chart out the periodic and demand fluctuations and try to understand their causes this can help us devise strategies towards matching demand and capacity we can chart periodic demand hourly daily weekly monthly or yearly for instance restaurants will have daily demand fluctuations while retails stores with phase early demand fluctuations similarly there can be random demand fluctuations due to factors like the whether which can happen demand for restaurant seats similarly demand from different segments can fluctuate for instance a bank might face predictable service demand from its business customers but unpredictable demand from its individual customers
now, there could be cases where the intellectual property right need not be protected by way of an ip and what kind of ip whether it should be or something for a shorter duration or whether it should be protected for a longer duration, what will be the kind of ip you would use this call is taken by the ip centre
now all text books of psychology if you visit them, you will find the reference of 1879 the year when the first laboratory of psychology was established by wilhelm wundt
let us estimate first the actual shear stress that the wall is subjected to because of this level of lateral loading
underwent series of reconstructions and almost all details related to the american indian culture were omitted and several others were rationalized when students try to recollect the story reconstruct the story what was very also interesting was that
96 degree and minus j 10 means, it is your 1
the answer is simple; the input has to be greater than the value of v p which is this ok
so, accumulators content accumulator content will be copied onto sbuf and whatever be the value a; so, that will be transmitted
so, here we say what are the visibilities that is, what are the access specifiers given in the base class
so, that is transmitting case, in the receiving case what happens if this is my antenna what is happening some e incident is falling on it on this antenna, what will that e incident do
keep that in mind these things no one will tell you, but then if you are no other go and you have to really have a lab cell culture facility adjacent to a microbial facility, then your only option is that you just implement strict code of conduct, so that contaminants from one side does not spill over into the other one
so, now, let us apply fleming’s left hand rule
similarly take the world of sports example, that we began with large number of children they play badminton in their houses, some of them they go to the coaching centers, some of them to go to state level, national level and then finally, you realized that there is somebody who finally, excels in this very area
now when this data is moved from the ram to the processor it gets decrypted within the processor
when you click on any one of these leds, the respective led will open up
anything you can really post it there and you will be in a position to really get the information about that
so, if in the previous lists set colours which had red, black and green, we ask whether black is in colours by using the word in, then, the return value is true
so, you know v ab, so put z, you will get this is the current 13
this is of course ia jxs that is why 90 degree shift we have shown
so, monostatic means i means the 2 d case
this 7 ohm will not be there because this inductor is short circuited
6 volts, the question also says that assume the temperature dependence of ni dominates over everything else
so, first of all draw a directrix line a vertical directrix line we are going to construct
when we say subword, of course we do not mean a word in the sense; we just mean a sequence of letters
let us actually put in some values now and try to calculate the electron and hole concentration and the conductivity
similarly, other two , you can apply the k v l
now, the objective of transfer of technology or the objective of commercializing research could be first that the fact that when research is commercialized, it could incentivize further research, because once you know that the objects that come or the products and services that could emanate from a research is something that is going to be valuable have commercial potential and something which the market is ready to consume, then that itself can incentivize research
if your delay is 4 weeks, your loss becomes 22%
so i am going to have 400 volts is to 400 by root 3 this is what i am going to get, so this is actually going to make automatic step down whether i like it or not, star delta configuration generally steps down the voltage on the delta side as compared to the star side
so, lest actually write this equation on the right hand side make some space again
and then the gsm module; in this course, we have used the sim900a gsm module, which i will be discussing in detail
then finally we will move on to comparison of electrical with the other mechanical as well as other types of systems
we cannot put the cost here
in this video capsule we shall look into the open source software packages onto our system such that we will be able to make effective simulation for this course
it is assumed that these are all identical to each other
ibc will be vbc by z delta, ica will be vca by z delta
so, t by tau
now, any sketch we would like to draw that we begin it on front plane
that is we really considering rigid arching mechanisms
so, this will have a break in the circuit, definitely when it is changing over from star to delta and one more problem also can be
now, if i were talking about the left boundary, my boundary condition that i impose will not be this one right, it will be other boundary condition, the other boundary condition meaning this guy, equation 3
so, to summarize our introduction to engineering drawings, we first looked at drawing sheets, drawing instruments, lettering layouts complete picture on dimensioning tolerances in the first 6 lectures
so, whenever ah whenever you consider i c in this ah phasor diagram and simplification, please see that current is leading; that means, that that angle has to be considered by 90 degree right
this ldr is sometimes also called a photo resistor; it is a resistance whose value changes depending on the light incident on it
participative budgeting, i just, i talk to you that every person, every employee is important for the firm
much older than any of us obviously
the receiving clock edge should not come before this
we will just observe as you go on with your life
so, being static they have a long life and are very stable so, the transformer get static device
due to the fact that the way wave is attenuated by that amount of each your each transit
and the relay is activated to turn off the lamp, when it receives the off message and the whole process continues
the 1st equation will give me 7 in the next will also give me another 7
we specify a collection of variables that describe the internal behaviour of the system and these variables are known as state variables of the system
so, what does that tell me in any relation n x square plus n y square is equal to 1
let us start one by one
how old are you
so, this becomes more effective and this mechanism we have seen in one of our earlier videos where we were demonstrating a real moving iron instrument
you know, in the night also it is working as though it is like a day camera because there is efficient ah, a, let us say l e d lighting, good amount of l e d lighting, good amount of l e d lighting covering a good spectrum, such that, ah, the camera is able to move back to the color mode
so, let us remove this portion
so, i just use this formulation most of the time, but this is perfectly valid
summation
so, now, i am decreasing lowering the input what will happen to the output
tangent theta is zero, secant theta is one, so that gives me zero, and so this comes out to be a at s z equal to zero, comes out to be mu naught i over two pi in z direction log of tan inverse l over s
we just assume that the capacitor holds a constant voltage and this is an open circuit because the transistor is cut off so obviously you get the same limit
please, go through this carefully couple of times because construction, destruction and associated object lifetime is all of the very, one of the core concept of object management in c++
a to b along path two and i am going form a to b, but notice that a to b along path two is same as minus of path b to a d l along path two
once you cross this i think; it is a education thing also because more you get into logical thinking and this and that and all that
so, this one goes via 45 degrees through that plane
so this is the minimum
a typical band reject filter, a typical band reject filter frequency response is shown in figure 17
000043173 per unit right
when an inventor assigns his invention to another person, say the employer or the company where he works, then the company, when it files in patent application, it has to show the proof of right
earlier it was 1 volt for one channel, second channel is 2 volts peak to peak
so, there using your mini drafter draw a perpendicular line this is the one
so this is going to be the per phase current which is being drawn by this load all the 3 phase loads
and that value happens when ql multiplied by epsilon f is equal to either +1 or 1
because clearly around this operating point we know that i2 is not changing with v2
2 volts across this and 4
i am not planning to go into great detail about open delta connection
so, this entire diameter if we are going to show it by leader line 5 10 units
so, this is at an offset of 584 bytes and has an address of 1584 from the start
in between and gate has to be fabricated on top of a insulating layer
so, let me take the load resistor, rl, which could be grounded
so if she is able to mount this ah against the p i r lens and and if she is able to hold it there, and if a human actually walks across, there will be multiple analogue signals that appear here which we will essentially give her a we will shall give you a feel of the number of detections: ah, ah, ah
so, all your original approximations if a nice sinusoidal current, they are no longer valid
so, what do you see is an image of different processes in the water cycle and this is converted into labels that can be dragged or dropped dragged and dropped by the learner onto the image
so, these are 2 adjacent elements ok
right now i do not want that casting to happen and therefore, i have used a keyword explicit in front of the constructor which basically tell this compiler that do not do any casting for this object
ampere turn per weber i should write as the reluctance whereas i am removing the turn because it is a dimensionless quantity
now if i know these strengths of the individual elements, can i arrive at the strength of the assembly in compression
so, these ducts always have some specialized kind of form, if you are looking at that they nicely turn and twist in that directions, for that kind of surface construction these coons surfaces are quite popular
now, vo is related to kteln nandni2
the output power will be v2 square by rl and the input power, the available power from the source which has a source voltage of vs and a source resistance of rs, this is the maximum available power which you know from maximum power transfer is vs square by 4rs
sometimes you would find that we try to pass on a particular emotion through our smiles etcetera, but eyes communicate the truth of the emotions
so, there is a role that this coaction is playing, but since the jointing material is of lower strength, as an outcome you have lowering of the overall strength of the masonry assembly in compression
similarly, if you see the this particular figure, which is delta
it is almost constant, earlier it was like 31, 32 because it he was holding with hand, the connection was were not proper
and when that does not happen there mind will go into a sort of sudden heightened anxiety or depression
the next thing that may we want to do is to look text in a string
you can drop the current density considerably and the protection will continue to occur because of that cathodic prevention rather than cathodic protection, if you remember the patch repairs all we were trying to do was prevent corrosion from happening just outside the patch repair
input required for 7 lakh worth of the sales in terms of raw material is the cost should be 3 lakhs and when it has come down from 7 lakh to 6 lakhs the sales level proportionately the material requirement level has also come down the material cost has come down so if you are able to maintain that efficiency level that if the output is going only then the input cost is going if the output is coming down input cost is also coming down then fine you are your decision making is efficient and you are efficiently utilizing all the resources of the firm
55 and eg is 1
so, is it i mean is it; are you all comfortable with what we did
so, the function we wanted is learners engagement in videos and we talked about operationalizing that via active video watching for example, via reflection spots
next problem, number seven, is light is incident normally on glass slab
but now the term revenue because entity might not be selling the goods, it can also be providing variety of services
what helps you there is in case of error possibly you will have lot of code to take care of lot of things to may be certain objects which need to be deleted which need to be destructed and so on, all these you can take care of at one place you do not need to copy that code it multiple places
if, you do it will become 10
ah, let us take this divergence
09 and in any case it has to be means it should not be less than 6 mm it should not be less than 6 mm
now we come to the row with holes
so, sum total of this gross current assets+loans and advances long term funds they have currently invested in the firm to fulfil their short term requirements, 20% of the total paid up share capital whichever is lower
if you put alpha is equal two, beta is equal to one
in contrast we find in that in arabic countries there is a better acceptance of body odors and they are considered to be natural part
if the gaze is down towards a right hand side the person might be recalling a feeling
so, have regular meetings like every week or every 2 weeks maximum, where if you can call it a scrum or you can call it a quick you know check; check point for your entire team
single phase transformer is connected as an auto transformer supplied load requiring 700 volts, that when the kva rating holds for…
shielding is important
we have illustrated various language features and not really many of them, and the library support that exist in c for this, and we demonstrate it with examples
i have silicon, i am growing oxide, then i am depositing aluminum on the back, and i am etching the aluminum this is aluminum or metal and i am etching the metal using process which is our lithography
so, let us think that the lid resistance will cause some small resistance added in all these 3 branches which are connected to it
it is the average value moving iron hot wire electro dynamic and induction you are what you call type instruments read the rms value of the signal right
we can mate this spiral with that spiral, so that it can be screwed otherwise surfaces are also we can really mate it
so, that is why it is a that your circuit of figure 39 with voltage step input v s u t
so if i choose the signs to be like that, then as vs increases, id will fall down, which will make the drain voltage increase, which will make the difference voltage, vd, this vd here, decrease
so, in that case you directly add this one, you will get r g plus j x g plus x l
so this is slightly more complicated than our original case
and now what happens is we end up having to compute fibonacci of 2 again, even though we already know the value
8 percent months
then employee benefit expense, power and fuel, finance cost, depreciation and amortization and other expenses
now, what we have to do we have to find out the value of the laplace transform of unit step function
now, if the spring is preloaded with some tension t then you can modify the previous equation while introducing the tension t as f t minus t equal to k into y t
but for fpgas, however, the problem is slightly different
whene are not operating, it is equivalent to capacityance, is equivalent to a capacitor due to its mechanical mounting right
no r r prime is remaining; r prime remaining at that point i am changing
so, the top portion, if we are trying to look at, there are lights here something like this
so, sorry minus 30 plus 8 i 1 plus 3 i 2 is equal to 0, now you substituting i 1 is equal to 3 i 3 and i 2 is equal to 2 i 3 into equation 7
at that point often a teacher does a discussion of the common errors that were seen when she or he was grading the papers and this is an opportunity for the students to reflect on what they did their performance, whether they have also had that error in their answer paper, what they can do to improve and so on
the variable which we will use to define free body diagram of this mechanical system
circuital law it was a current going i calculate how much current is threading through this
now, let us understand this understand this particular concept with the help of few examples, so that you can understand the concept clearly, let us see one example where we have to find out the y parameters of the circuit given below
it is very much fine
so, that led to henry the viii leading passing a law, banning the imports of books into england because printing technology was practiced everywhere
it will be different, so you should be given a situation to derive the kva rating, under that given situation you have to derive
so, the act the first act that we have is the trademarks act, 1958
so, always differentiate between wages and salaries
0 this is just an understanding; that means, ploss with series capacitor will be it is v is equal to 0
but it is a continuous and a gradual loss in value of fixed assets in case of other assets like inventory or like investment values can go up and down but for fixed asset from the date of purchase till the date it is scrapped out the value of asset continuously falls
a boundary edge is what is going to invoke this right hand side that is otherwise t m is 0 on the boundary right; if t if m is not on the boundary if this m is not on the boundary this term is 0 bad choice of variables m here is suppose to be variable, but we made it equal to number of boundary edges, but hopefully its clear you can make this all into i if you want
and also another thing to look at is whenever we invent a circuit like this, whenever we come up with a bias circuit, we have to make sure that the transistor remains in saturation because that is the desired operating point for an amplifier
yeah, we do not want to encourage individual sharing but we want all the sharing to happen so that it can contribute to that one master note
2 and skip i m, which will not which is not mentioned here
lets also give some names to these vertices: a, b, c, d, e and f
so if you calculate this variance finally this will come up as how much if you solve this equation this comes up as rupees 71 unfavorable
so tree can also be consider as a sub graph, but it has some special properties
let us construct those
so what he said was, that the time that you take in the original learning, okay
so, the essential parts are the projections
so this deviates from how interrupts are typically managed so as we know from earlier classes that whenever an interrupt completes it execution this is done by the iret instruction and the iret instructions would essentially enforce the previous context and the program which was executing prior to the interrupt occurring but continue to execute
let say you take this, it will have a manhattan distance of three up to s
water is an integral part of the structure and therefore most characterisation techniques we need to remove the water
the program is syntactically correct it is something that the python interpreter can execute, but while the code is being executed some error happens
that is how these all is h 1 got cancelled from another h 1 from somewhere else and so on, all the h s got cancelled over there
we will use these to calculate the electron hole concentrations in semiconductors and then proceed from there
this is the operating profit
so, here it is given that v ab is equal to v p angle 0 is equal to your line voltage we write v l angle zero
suppose i connect impedance z0 at ports 2 and 3 and then i try to find out the input impedance z in, then z in will be equal to z0 and that will be true for all the other ports
similarly for profile plane this becomes projected one
at each version design, modifications are made along with adding new functional capabilities
so what it is non virtual in b, because q is a b type pointer
there are two sticky notes that you can see, those have the conditions of the problem that we are going to solve today
and just look at the every constructor has a message to see what is happening at the construction
so if we can go back to our slide, first thing that we see is that, this is the expression of a fourier series, this has the same expression as the fourier series
now you see there are 2 channels like we have discussed, right
these fault models actually influence the complexity and power of the attacker now if an attacker is able to inject a bit fault that is precisely change exactly 1 bit in the fault then the attack becomes extremely easy
as you can see, it's important to have control on the eccentricity of loading
but the revised version came up in 2009 and it was in the 2009 edition that he has incorporated his findings about what he has termed as micro expressions
raise to eight, which is two over three pi times ten raise to minus six joules per metre cube
so, you see let me do something a little bit more accurate
that is completely lost
that means that the rank of matrix s is less than 3 and since it is also singular means there will be definitely a case when the rank of the matrix will be less than 3
but then let me give you an example, may be within next just continuing this if you look at lot of poetry and one of the prime examples of this poetry is
in that case transient response will not decay to zero
so, if a is 0, we set the angle to be 0; otherwise, this is the python function in the math library for tan inverse, arc tan, we set theta to be the arc tan b minus a b divided a
so, typically when you see a simulation of red and white then you should have assumed that one is maximum positive, one is maximum negative and white is 0 this dot that is the source
43 which is less than 9 newton per millimetre square so it is okay so this is how we could find out the maximum pressure now i can find out the minimum pressure fmin so minimum pressure will be p by a minus m by ze so it will be 379
on exposing the wafer with uv light what will happen the area here it is negative photoresist which is opposite to for positive photoresist
but, i have to keep an eye on how much is the current that is flowing because i do not want to exceed whatever is the rated current value
d1 and before again it will flow in the next yellow half cycle
now, he has created the following content as you see here that the students need to go through and be able to learn and understand about the parts of the flower
taylor series is nothing but you will have a constant term, you will have first order dependence on the variables and second order dependence on the variables and so on
let us say in a typical structure this could be 30, 40 or even 100 years, now after that the structure will continue to corrode and then this eventually you will start seeing spalling and that is the real end of the service life means without any
the input offset voltage, is the voltage that must be applied to the input terminals of the opamp to null the output voltage to make the output voltage 0
the incremental voltage v and the incremental current i are related by this expression
and you can also be shown that the total gain of this amplifier is equal to the s 1 square or the gain of any of these amplifiers
now this aes implementation takes a plain text and the secret key and gives you a cipher text
first worth to 2 years of age, what he called has oral stage
so, the size of the cut that you make, the area of the cut that you make must be as close as possible to the flat jack itself
vast majority of the tasks are periodic and their period and deadline are the same and the execution time is a fraction of the period
so, that is going to be our strategy
there is nothing more in this example will just use more of these examples subsequently
so, finally, the picture of our basic amplifier looks like this
so, in cities mobile when it can be converted to another form of energy right and the motion of charge creates and electric your fluid we call it is current
so, if i look at this expression over here, i can think of it as the dot product between two vectors right
so, solving equation 1 and 2, we get w i is equal to 267
so since these two are in parallel, what you can apply
and after all the difference between v1 and e1 is not too much, it is okay
a company which is efficient will be able to sell more and more using lesser capital
and we can take an expression of this file kind of comparison, which yields as we said a boolean value, and take this boolean value and assign it to a name
so this is going to be vac so the line voltages are 30 degrees shifted from the phase voltages right
i will create a role
there is one more function that we have written, readsim900a(), let us understand this carefully
so, in case of function f here and here the binding is static which means which function it calls depends on the type of the pointer
so, the task time may extend beyond the deadline
now you are being asked to calculate what is t max what is t starting and what is the value of full load copper loss
not only for this year, for earlier years, it can be compared with the statements of other companies or other entities or of industry average, then the information in the statement becomes much more useful and enriched
and, at that time dr
for example, in japan listeners particularly women are taught to focus on a speaker’s neck in order to avoid eye contact
for instance, coca cola is a trademark which has been kept alive for close to 100 years
therefore, in this case the function will proceed with a being 5 and b being 10 and it will compute and you can see from the output a plus b will compute to be 25 and that is what will be printed
so, from this v o will become just from this equal to v c which is same as v i delta t by r c
so, they are not at the same level, that this a and b two different levels right, and this is the point that your what you call that lowest point o, and from here this distance is from o to a, it is x 1 and this side o to, actually if you make this is a, if i make this is your a dash, then oa dash is x 1, and if this is b, if we make this is b dash then your ob dash is x 2 right, and distance between this two point; that is a dash and b dash, it is horizontal distance it is l say right
ok, so it is trying to trace the paths using some lines which are running parallel and close to the boundaries of the obstacles
so, the potential is the same
let us look at what happens when we assign names
your own means you may not be owning it but consider it as your company and start studying it from now
now with that you can go back and estimate the compressive force and since we know that the tensile force is going to be by equilibrium c minus p we get an estimate for the tensile force
so here, z and y are the impedances and admittances per unit length
so, in that case electric field etcetera is just a function of x
we will close module one here
ok, so lets assume that the total output load capacitance is capital x times this minimum base capacitance, c in
the second model which was more looking in terms of the elaboration process, whether you look at the information only from a perceptual point of view or whether you look at the information from a structural point of view or whether you go for an extensive elaboration
ok, fine, so just like clock, for v, d, d and power routing also, we need two steps
so, in the short circuit test, as the name indicates, i am having the transformer here and i am going to short circuit the secondary
it was in 1924, when he was a research scholar in the university of minnesota and he was experimenting on the facial expressions of emotions
so, i have just put a few simple equations of pictures over here to show you simulation results
4, s is equal to 22
so, v is equal to ws and h is equal to w into c because this is horizontal one
2f, this whole thing to the right of the colon tells me how to format the values comes from here
so may be if i have a full load torque i may have some current like this, please note this current is still lagging it cannot be at unity power factor because i do have a x2 dash i cannot ignore x2 dash
so, this is what you get when you differentiate this is the equation with respect to xl
i know beforehand that my object is going to be sparse in the wavelet domain right
suppose, i have a complicated network which i am trying like a box and it has two terminals between which i want to measure
so, it is not sharp, it is you see is this decreasing
so, make it volt, 100 into 1000 by 447 ohm that is 223
let us start with x equal to 5, y equal to x
another thing that you have to understand here is that it is very easy to understand how to apply the input signal; how to check the output signal; and at what cut off frequency designed by us the signal will not allowed to be passed
so, what will happen in that case, your v2 by i2 will become equal to zl and in that case you can say zin, that is input impedance from primary side will be equal to 1 by n square zl square
so, this is sin 90 degree minus theta cos theta or cos 90 degree minus theta sin theta, there should not be any confuse right
so, far have we specified the locations x i
so, then you shall see that this is the waveform or how the voltage is varying
so, what is the first step i should do
this is a question which i still have not been able to answer
2 equals to 4
this is a core of the management process as i told you earlier that without planning no controlling is possible
the same way when i am looking at actually the conductor actually rotating like this after some time this conductor will reach here and this conductor will reach here
so, this one this is this left side is ttl compatible on the right side is rs232 c compatible
so, we will just see what it was
can it give you dc power supply
on date fifth, we have purchased 5,000 units at 7, then 12th, 3,000 units at 9 and then on 20th 6,900 units at 9
we can say that x is y checks if x and y refer to the same object
v bc is root 3 v p angle minus 90 degree that also we have done
so, that is why v s s is equal to v s
so, how do you keep them engaged
so, let us just use the formula, so this will be first term will be
hhere you see, we can apply through here, or we can apply through here
in the next lecture we will be turning this whole faradays law into in terms of fields
we will go to mate and this distance limit
you can go as many as you want, but we can stop at a level where we are comfortable, we have a skill set, that you can use to solve the problem there
so, these questions are provided in the learning app questions such as what do i already know and students start with the stem, i know that or i know how
there will be a set of rules i shall we shortly talking about
so, e to the power minus pi by l it is a real number right
here we shall be very briefly talking about some of the sensors like speaker, temperature sensor, lm35, light dependent resistor, microphone that we shall be showing as part of the demonstration
6 millimeter so hf we can find out from this and beta f will become moment of inertia of compression flange by moment of inertia of compression flange plus moment of inertia of tension flange and since ifc and ift is same here becuise this is an i section so because of i section we can uhh consider ifc and ift as same so this will become 0
but you have the load flow coding say assuming that you have the load flow coding of a system then you have to find out there are several you know several different ways are there to find out the best locations of the shunt capacitor or our dg also right
two of our colleagues, tejaswini and abhirami, will start the demonstration
println, it will print “light on” in the serial monitor
and another test which has undergone multiple revision and in my opinion perhaps this is one of the widely used test is the wechsler intelligence skill which has both the versions the wisc and wais
so, del dot something is replaced by this whole expression
these are the steps after turning operation if you are using lathe machines constructing such kind of turnings or steps is quite easy
ok, so we interconnect this scan flip flops in a suitable way so that we can configure it as a shift register, if you want
now, in the older process technologies, so earlier what you had, we had that the wires were pretty narrow but they are much wider
so, in this case, we talk about the important points here that advantages of the budgets
so, the same dispatch will happen and this function will get called and so on
but if corrosion is not very much then you do not need much current at all
so they can be represented as inductances which are coming in series with this winding
this way you can also think about the conservation of charge if you are really that much keen about it, but this is the path of the current we are going to consider
a set of 3 heuristics a mean, median and something known as triviality to identify potential stealthy signals in a hardware circuit
so, if you put all these value i infinityi 4 i infinity and t your tau value
so this is the electric field in z cap
if this profile plane tilted in the direction of vertical plane with an angle theta, we call that one as auxiliary vertical plane
so normal function calls as i was showing; overloaded function calls, overloaded operators and so on
so, at this point what happens is the distractor of a is called
there will be sufficient flow of current sufficient flow of drain current why because now my electrons from source cannot reach to drain using the channel here
9284
because each energy state or each molecular orbital we can have 2 electrons
how to calculate the losses
so the gate delay zero to one, one to zero
the stress at the center of the brick, if you were to examine what is happening at the center of the brick, the axial compression level, sigma b is sigma y, we are assuming that the average normal stress is the value which is the normal stress acting at the center of the brick
25 electron volts above the fermi function at the fermi energy we can easily use the boltzmann approximation instead of f of e
so only five test vectors are required
so, let me clear it so you assume that at time t is equal to 0 we assume that the inductor as an initial current i 0 right
when for t greater than 0 so it is closed u t is equal to 1 right so; that means, i t is equal to this direction
this is switching side allows switch over from one to the other when the iccp has finished working
so, if i solve this what will i have
so, if i include probably part of the field coil only, the resistance will come down from 0
so, if this is the condition and the transfer impedances are equal that is z12 is equal to z21, it means that we can say that two port is reciprocal
so, that is a big thing which psychology has; it is in the hand of psychology actually
so now, he is increasing to 20 hertz, you can see the function generator
so, every other stage during this life's ic design cycle could potentially be spot where a trojan can be inserted
if he is early to go to sleep, he will be on time
and this tap controller is again ah sequential circuit of final state machine and there are sixteen states actually i am not going to detail
this is the way we project a point in the first quadrant
so this is also used to make something called a faraday's cage
in the next class, we will learn about helix how to construct that
so, with this you can differentiate whether in the circuit there is a independent voltage or current source or a dependent voltage and current source
this is gm times vgs where vgs appears here
2 meter, the personal zone is 1
instead of that, we have an object like trim entities
it is one; it is a unit vector right and what is the direction of this vector
for example, when a company actually designs a circuit or designs a vlsi chip and sends it for fabrication to a third party, hardware trojans may be inserted
it need not be travelling along the z, but the absorption i mean the parameters that i have to set is only the z parameter, but it's absorbing any direction incident on it
so, for nth order component we written sny
so, i a angle 120 degree right
now, what is critical for it know is after growing the cells in all these conditions which is we are our goal is to you know come as close as possible almost; similar almost congruent then what we have to do the cells which are growing here their properties have to be evaluated
then it has low resistance low output resistance
now next the most interesting and possibly one of the most powerful feature of c programming that comes up
you can give a character which will be used to fill up the empty space on either side rather than a blank
and now in the next module, we will implement it on the breadboard, alright
we have tau is equal to reduced cohesion plus mu into sigma y where mu again is reduced friction coefficient being the first criterion
so, you to have to increase x m and r 0
72, but x c only variable between 2 and 8 ohm
we are referring to the spandrels and these are horizontally aligned elements of different aspect ratio and their primary role is transfer of forces between the peers when there is lateral action
from there to there, draw it is a stepped cylinder that means, we have to construct a line goes down, from there again goes down, click ok
so by just extension i should be able to draw a brush here and one more brush here this is how it is connected
now if the 2 windings of the transformer are connected in series to form as auto transformer find the possible voltage ratio and output right
what is the formula for that
57) 1
so, the deleted node has only one child we can bypass the child and directly connect the parent of the deleted node to the one child of the deleted node
now, what we have already seen is that from here, that that we have assumed that c l will be u to the power n, c in, so from there u can write what will be n
so, we can keep this j by omega mu naught outside common, the first component over here
there are some properties
if it is free then we add a queen this is exactly the code that pseudo code we had if, i is n minus 1 we return true otherwise we try to extend the solution by placing a queen at i plus 1th row
g is again overridden in b which continues to be virtual this is what needs to be noted that once i make a function virtual in a class, then any class which derives it must get it as a virtual function
now what i will do i want to plot the strength of this magnetic field as a function of time
in few countries a rule is different; you are supposed to be on the right side
no; my question is this, i have from a i want to get to fields right
so this is actually the stick diagram layout of this function
delta x
but now we are saying no, not immediately after the clock comes, let us wait for another time t hold before this logic operations is allowed to start
then variable manufacturing cost or supplies, supplies means small, small materials, sub materials like lubricants, oils and other kind of the small materials
like i am showing this device, it has four pins; one is the power supply 5 volts, ground, then this is analog out
so, if we make a plot between li and omegac and suppose omegac is our cut off frequency, then it means that the insertion loss should increase to a maximum of 3 db for frequencies less than omega c and beyond omega c, it would increase
so if i just use abs, it will always mean my abs it will never mean the abs that existed in the library
so, when the python interpreter detects an error it gives us information about this error and as we saw it comes in two parts, there is the type of the error give what kind of error it is
so, when you fabricate one transistor, you can propagate millions of transistor in the same process right
so, this is a valid connection so, but this is invalid connection
the trick is simple then you take this input signal and pass it through flip flop like this
what i saying is that suppose we are deliberately introducing a delay out here, lets say, a delay of plus two
so, what is the first you have to find out what is the value of i 2
142 ampere right
but in the deadline monotonic algorithm, task t2 is the highest priority task because it has the lowest deadline
it’s the same phenomena called corrosion that happens even in copper
we just connect this rl in series
if you remember e fi is nothing but a representation of the chemical potential or the amount of work that needs to be done in order to remove an electron from a semiconductor
4 x 1013 cm 3
some people are very clearly able to tell that we go to a market and a mind becomes like this
72 kilo newton and where we have where we have assumed splice plate thickness as 6 mm so the design load for splice we could calculate that is pu1 plus pu2 which is coming 255
conservative means i deliberately say that a wire length should be this, which is more than what is required, because i am keeping the tolerance in mind, even for fabrication process variations
we called nu r h and something h dash
that is our one line goal to understand how we can fabricate a mosfet
so, what is common over there the partial derivative with respect to
once it is done, label them p 2, p 3 is already there, this is p 4, p 5 points
again the idea is not to explain it here, but i have worked this out, so that you can take this code carefully, study and convince yourself that you understand exactly how the construction, the copy construction
so, the work around is larger distance between the object and boundary right as it is if i the moment i deviate from 1d anyway i am going to have a reflect loss i mean the reflection coefficient non zero reflection that we have seen before right
the function with the same name must have different number of formal parameters or different types of formal parameters we have seen examples of both
so, this m matrix will then get multiplied over here
now i have mentioned this previously this is a special function, hankel function consisting of bessel functions right
and if i remember it right this was done with sucrose as well as with nycodenz and there are specific devices which are being used to measure the density i will give you those papers there you can check it out what the kind of devices which are being used to make these kind of density gradients columns
and a and with respect to the hold time constraints this i mention that these are the early signal transitions that create a problem
how much is the functioning and activation of the endocrine and other autonomic functions, and then how is spontaneously the neuromuscular system they respond, and these factors also know would help you have this type of a interaction okay
that is all your bars may not reach the maximum value of the permissible tension itself
as i told you one simple way is take money, give them share, then it will go in item a, that is known as share capital
now, this is a residual interest of the enterprise or this is the amount which enterprise or a company has to pay to the owners
so, this is going to be the, these are going to be the equations that govern the operation of a separately excited dc generator, by the way because this whatever we observed here is the load terminal voltage and the load current it is external to the machine, so we call this as external characteristics of the machine, external characteristics of the machine, whereas this is open circuit characteristics of the machine
so, 259 forms one chuck, 7024 forms the other chunk
it is a slow motion
so, the finite element method needs that these basis functions they should have certain properties of continuity and differentiability which we will come to later ok
and that is one concept, the other concept was the boundary condition
85 is a good estimate
the crucible is cooled down the crucible is cooled down alright
09 00979 or 0
hello everyone, welcome to our engineering drawing and computer graphics course; we are in module 1 and lecture 2 in introduction to engineering drawing
fault list will be updated if one and more of the following conditions are satisfied: firstly, of course, the fault is local to the gate or the value implied at at least one input or the output of the gate is different from that in the corresponding fault free version
the only exception in this case is the case when f of s simple pole at s equal to 0
so, j i am not putting
there is the effect of having the output voltage something other than 0 volts when 2 input terminals are shorted together right
sitaram is here to accompany me and he will be showing you how to connect this multimeter to the dc power supply so, let us see
now, there is an extra graphic that has been added this picture of thomas edison, which was not important to be put in this particular image here
so, this is actually voltage drop right this is the approximate approximate way of calculation right because we have taken delta is very small so cos delta is 1
so, there is the hierarchy between these three
let us pick the part 1, there are three parts the first part is there is a point a 20 mm above horizontal plane and 25 mm behind vertical plane
so, far we have been concentrating on the boundary because that is the more sort of critical crucial part next we will look at the left hand side
so, that when charge q is put in this field, the force on this charge is given as q times e r
so, there is my point 8 ampere that means, this is 10 i x i x is equal to 3
64 so you can see a slightly worrisome figure here what was 13% in march 14 became 11% and now it is about 9
and i know that, x is the bottom value i know it is x to the power n, but i do not remember whether x comes first, or n comes first
this triangle i am mentioning as pqr
now we have concluded our discussion on edf, the earliest deadline first algorithm, that is the optimal scheduling algorithm
so, when we are making concrete, we have to take into account what is coming from the cement and what is coming from the aggregates and also add on whatever is coming from the supplementary cementitious materials
remember, how much is the volume element, this small volume element d v is going to be again a is very, very small a is much, much, much less than the radius of these spheres a in fact, will tend to 0
so, i am looking at the rotor and the rotor might also carry a current
in the last lecture we looked at how to make iterative or inductive definitions more efficient than na•ve recursion, and we saw memoization and dynamic programming as tools to do this
so, typical schedule table would look like the different frames and the tasks that are to be executed
so average transitions per toggle is only one right
the 21st division is the applied experimental and engineering psychologist they primarily look at the psychological principles knowledge and research to improve technology consumer products energy systems communications and information transportation the decision making process work setting and living environment
but what existed was, this term existed right when they approach not independently, but in the same rate when they approach at the same rate it existed right
so whenever we talk about ah, myotube or a muscle, they are governed by motor neurons
at this point the data equation is being satisfied because x 1 x 2 lie on the data line; that means, i have got s is equal to g s ux very good and at the same time of all possible solutions can i say that this solution has the minimum energy
and as we have seen last time, ethics is very important part of governance which is very much there in indian culture
because all the things whatever we are observing it is step function you assumed right
so, our auxiliary plane method, when we know the front views and the top views in this case, ah front view is giving us a line with true line and the top view is after ah having this view, we are getting a pentagon of regular shape
finally, if we succeed, that is this try succeeds the int works then we will exit from this try block go to the else and the else will break out to of the loops
now, bank is having lacks of customers and they are having variety of transactions
we have to choose between looking backwards and looking forwards
again we study this in signals and systems
now next, what do you have to do
so, if you have 6 times 10 to the 23 lithium atoms coming together to form a solid you have 6 times 10 to the 23 molecular orbitals
if you look into the circuit, if you look into the circuit right is your what we call that your v ab is equal to this one, just let me go up that here it is v ab v small ab is equal to v capital ab
so, but anyway r is equal to 0 at running condition
if you have understood cement chemistry you know that the reaction of formation of cementitious hydration products from the cementitious components or compounds leads to the generation of pores spaces because you do not have a complete filling of the pores by the hydration products
) so, essentially the targeted application by this worm or this particular worm was the microsoft’s iis web server and the string which was executed was as shown over here
so we can write ys, now as equal to 1 by s into xs when you are asked to find the transfer function that means you need to find out ys upon xs
similarly, if we are looking a point precisely on the horizontal plane, above that vertical plane, on the vertical plane above horizontal plane; that means, this point
once it is done, divide that into 5 equal parts
the j will be inertia of the body and alpha is called as angular acceleration
they would prefer your shop over other shops because of the trust factor, because of reliability and so on
i plus half
but what if i can change the gain to 1; so, what if i change the gain to 1
so, if i take r1 equals to 10, r 2 would be hundred kilo ohm
yes, in the case of receiving antenna there is an incident field right
so, it will be used as the value to latch the lower order address bus to a lower address on the port 0 that lower order address bus
now the intuition for the boundary condition that i had given you was that the phase should not reflect back from this hypothetical boundary correct
we will also take you through the format and sequence of this course which will make it easy for you to navigate through the course
so, 500 millivolts now you have to understand what is the output voltage and what is a time
so this way, this way if you look into this the this one right [ ] so this phi r f2 which is with respect each other creates the torque tending to move the rotor in the direction of fr the if that induction motor is therefore, a self starting device right
so if i look at what was wf originally when the curve was in p or the operating point was in p
so, if we are looking from this view, this entire rectangle, this banded line, and this one already projected
so as you go on partitioning, it may so happen that a will land up here and b will land up there
so, this is a significant weakness and the modern day solution is to go for reinforced masonry but in the past this was not countered by reinforcing masonry but rather by dimensioning walls in a way that you have the thrust line due to the combination of the lateral forces and the gravity forces required to stay within the middle third of the cross section
and then we very carefully seal this
and if on the other hand the power has a minus sign right that is power is being supplied by the element so, but, but how do we know when the power has a positive or a negative sign right; so, this is the question
if some of the common cases can be detected early by using some special circuits, then the output of that circuit can disable the main functional block from participating in the calculation if that condition holds, which means it is not required
then the sales figure is certainly come down because sales value was expected to be 279 but looking at the selling price now it is 60, 270, so there is a variance of the 62,000 because selling price remaining the same number of units coming down so naturally the sales value will come down and there is a variance which is unfavorable
so, one thing is there that this is ok this 5 volt is connected, but this is 5 u t right
we grow oxide, this is our oxide, then what we do
r and ng spice can perform the simulation
because of this particular property of the synchronous machine which can work at unity power factor
so, it is cos 90 your what you call that i0 is your i m = i0 right it will be cos 90 minus ∅0
advance tax and then the first quarter 10000 in the second quarter 10000 third and 10,000 in the fourth quarter to total tax will be deposit for 40000 rupees, but this is on the estimation basis, sometimes what happened your sales go up very high unexpectedly the sales god very high and actual may be possible the text word in all the text component was not 30,000, but it was 40000 sorry it was not 40000
[u19]if i can do that, then i found my situation, the solution, all right, and that is a trick that [u20]we [u21]use in method of images
so, some of the current will be flowing through the shield wire and the remaining current flows; tower to the earth; that means, rest it will go from the tower to the earth
so, if you want to understand this thing, you have to use this equipment
so, looking at this the first thing to do is let us take a simple simplified version of this, when we say that we are going to look at what are called far fields ok
so here i am showing, ah, cmos, nand gate
and, especially we have some parametric variation r of z in terms of u in terms of cos functions sin functions if i am going to revolve as a circle along one particular z direction, we will get the object which we call revolved surfaces
so, but thevenin’s theorem suggests that if you if you just rest of the circuit, if you can bring it to an equivalent two terminal circuit, then after that you connect this one you can easily find out what is the current flowing through this load resistance r right
so, now you have to find out the standard rate and then the standard actual yield minus standard yield
now, as far as the watt meter is concerned let me draw the potential coil
it was not the tension controlled condition and therefore we are making a change in the amount of steel that we put into the wall such that we are in the tension control condition
so obviously, the string will actually have to be dynamically allocated
now, if you look into the objective of this lesson we see that objective of this lesson was actually to allow students to be able to identify the different parts of a bulb
these are the minor issues
that means we try to minimize the number of bends, like, for example, from this t to s
and that ratio what we call in geometry as eccentricity
so, on this rising edge the value will be picked up by the 8051 chip and again the
now, the question in your mind will be which are such items
now further you can also have the effects of drying out on a structure that is dry on one side and wet on the other side, so you are pulling the salts to the other side by wick action, okay
now because filing patents involves a substantial investment in terms of money a patentability report can tell you whether you have to make that invention, a substantial investment is involved in patenting and if the value of the invention is critical for the inventor, then the inventor may choose to go beyond a patentability search and ask for a validity search or a validity study
so, this is called the non executable stack or the w ^ x bit
how do i do nothing in python
so when the ph at the steel cementitious interface reduced below certain level of 9 or 11, so there is possibility of depletion of this passivation layer and due to that the corrosion can initiate in the concrete
any movement because of fixed assets or investments, either buying or selling, which was all categorized as investing activities
so, this is at an angle like, it is neither vertical nor horizontal this is like this ok
the software only goes through this once
so, at that time 100 and 100 ohm are in parallel right, when it is open
and that is what we call hatching, hatch
to draw any figure, we require typical geometrical construction using protractors compass pencil and so on things
we looked at that how we can do placement taking into account the timing characteristic or the timing parameters in mind
now let us make it general
you can perform the experiment along with a mentor you can perform the experiment with your friends, and see how you can design active high pass filter, how you can design an active low pass filter, how you can design a passive high pass filter, how can is an a passive low pass filter
so we will use kirchhoff's law for this
so, upon substitution if i am not writing here it is understandable
so if we have some geometric information, you will be knowing that
instead, of having two poles i can also have multiple number of poles in which case the stator winding will also have multiple a phase winding, multiple b phase winding, multiple c phase winding like what we talked about in the case of induction machine
the firm's profit will increase by that 8 rupees and 50 pesa because the cost has come down
so, other than a and b, if there are deposits received for more than one year or if there are some terms salaries which are unpaid for a a longer period they are all shown under other long current long long term liabilities then 3d is long term provisions so provisions are those items in liabilities of which the amount is not known with substantial accuracy so so, a provision is created and it is shown under 3d, especially if it is for more than one year
learn about it, read about it once again from the theory class, understand the experiment, read this particular set of module or look at it
now the problem with python is that wherever you put this kind of a colon it expects something after that, you cannot have an empty block
the transformer is not the regular transformer provided by spice, that is a linear transformer model
alright this is a ordering information, when do when you want to order ic you should know what parameters, you have to use you will know this parameter when you look at the data sheet, when you understand the data sheet then you can understand which ic i should order right
in today's class, we look at few more objects like only one view
similarly, x m will be v 1 upon i m
the surface does not actually exist i have just mathematically drawn a box and let us say this is overall this is my the domain that i am interested in ok
and d u right so, this is how i would do it and this is if f is polynomial you can see this will be very simple to calculate right can i get it can i get a closed form expression for it if f is polynomial yes
for example, we now need 500 units for say manufacturing the production in the current period in the month of january
maybe your fabrication is perfect, but your design was wrong, because of some incorrect connections and so on
there may be tradeoffs which depend on the type of use they are going to put a data structure to as to which internal implementation works worst best, but what you have to always keep in mind is that the implementation should not change the way the functions behave
and this is n phase 1 that is nfh 1, that is the stator side actually number of turns will call nph 1 and f frequency and phi r is the flux per pole
it appears that they never close on themselves
kinesics conveys specific meanings that are open to cultural interpretation
so, that is rather straightforward and this is what you would be doing as far as comparing the pm interaction diagram from the limit state approach to the pm interaction diagram that you have seen yesterday
so, let's look at the nettegrity of how to develop the schedule table
so, therefore, the net force which is again going to be vertical will be 2 pi sigma q over 4 pi epsilon 0 h integration r varies from 0 to capital r r dr over h square plus r square raise to 3 by 2, and now if i make the substitution h square plus r square equals let us say y square
so, we have to incur the administrative expenses so they are also added proportionately into the one unit of the each unit of the product
here you stop probably at 50% or lesser of what could be the failure stress
power factor for cd part it is 4 upon root over 4 square plus 3 square 0
17,750 this payment we have to make and what is our collection
let us quickly once again see ideally we know that input impedance of op amp is infinite right, then there is no current end entering in the input of the op amp, but in the real world some content does enter the inputs
now if you take p&l, we can compare these two values but instead of comparing actual values we want to first convert them into percentage
, wwhich is an important part of an lc oscillator
yeah how do i introduce it
it requires an operating system to support certain features, then only it will become rt pogics complaint
so, before we continue, a small note for you is that this particular video is not that important for exams and similar things, but this is interesting
the reason is here say in this line, i am estimating the current in the secondary or the search coil by dividing the e m f induced with the resistance of the search coil
again, this one is 25 and again this one 28
so i will also put the simulation circuits for practice so that you can practice the simulation and see the waveforms
first of all, why did we have this rg
this is the first item
so again as many researchers have pointed out multiple number of times the adequacy of protection to steel offered by concrete in the cover layer is the key to obtaining durable concrete structures
a 1
but possibly the most celebrated example is the mars pathfinder
and you can see that it is now stable
a typical cheat code type of hardware trojan would look something like this we have a input over here and the attackers specific cheat code is stored over here
and considering that resistance of the circuit is a constant, the current can remain as a constant
in general, i can call both these things together as wound field rotor, which means i am going to have field winding whereas in permanent magnet i do not have to have this field winding
purpose of an amplifier is to amplify some voltage maybe because you want to measure it ok
so, the first term is going to give me a minus k x square minus k y square minus k z square i am writing this k as
now let us say i am very impressed by speech and i want to comment on it
branch represents a single element such as voltage source or a resistor
welcome to this module and in this module, we will see some more characteristics of an operational amplifier
so, we will leave it blue for now
this refer to your conduction band, this refers to the valence band, this is efp this is efn
now lets see how to simulate faults
debencher, 10,000 was opening, 27 was closing, increase of 17, f 17 f so it represents what a financing inflow humne debentures issue so we have got cash and we have given debentures getting it so inflow is 17 but don't write 17 directly in cash flow because there could be some item in p&l
so, let us look at some examples of direct and indirect band gap semiconductors
for example the power, power will be the variable because if you go for the production you will use the power but if you don't go for the production you will not use the power
so if you calculate the total balance available here after adjusting for everything, then finally we will be able to find out that our net balance is going to be very good, very positive balance we have with us
we have talked about the stm32 board, we have talked about the arduino uno board that are very popular development boards
and when i send with this particular mobile, it will only work
we will look further into this when we discuss the working principle
so this clearly gives me a straight line torque speed relationship provided i do not consider armature reaction
so, let us join by freehand sketch
so vs you can simply see as us minus zs and this goes into the transfer function gs and you get the output as ys
so, my new formula for the output voltage will be ad into vd plus acm into v cm
so, in this case what is happening that from this equation3 that for resonance so, that is if zc to the power for two values means because here plus minus is there plus minus is there
417 kilowatt per phase
so they would not really have the hysteresis property much
this 3 functions one is unit step the unit impulse and the unit ramp all are underlined right
let us write it over here, grad phi dot n hat what you will write it as nx dou phi by dou x plus n y dou phi by dou y right
if that is the case then in case of an ideal op amp vd goes to 0
so that’s the relationship between what you see on the x axis, x axis here at the bottom and at your left is the y axis where you are tracking on time performance of the student
so the smaller the pore is, the higher, the faster on average it is going to hit the surface
so, the armature reaction drop occurs in a dc machine in addition to ia ra drop
this is just for the checking purpose that the message has been sent or not
so, there is a lot of research that has been done into how to define the current source as a function of time which i am not going into, but a lot of work has been done and this software which i have mentioned to you earlier meep as many different ways in which you can choose the current source best suited for your application we will come to it later
we will take out this crank rod out of it
see here 4 k boltzmann constant, temperature, bandwidth, resistant right
5 percent the load changes 1
there was compression due to the gravity and compression in the other direction and there was vertical splitting as you see in the end blocks and this is possibility given the multiple materials, multiple strengths and stiffnesses that we use in masonry
as you know the most common derived type in c are arrays
a square wsine wave see wave is converted to square, right where your duty cycle, is one term thatwhich we will see later, on and off time is different
so after cd means where load was not increasing, but after that point, uhh, it is starts resisting, uhh, deformation
so, if load increases delta p l is positive this should be in your mind and if load decreases delta p l is negative, right
so, if you neglect the i 0 then from the transformer you have seen i 1 is equal to i 2 dash is equal to same current 35
right, finite difference
supposing, we are computing this one entry then we want to compute the minimum across many different pairs right this entry this entry and so on
it is sinusoidal in voltage wave shape and this needs to be interfaced to a load which expects unidirectional voltage wave shape
however, here because of the deformation of the panel and the deformation of the frame and the contact pressures typically you should expect the shear sliding to occur at mid height
if you use tat you can very easily find out world view of the individual, you can very easily find out the inner complexes of the individual, and you can very easily draw a line to find out if a person who has these many complexes could be in these types of situations, whether this very individual would be good for my organization or not
it is written in terms of vsd and vsd and the incremental current source points from source to drain instead of from drain to source
so, to measure suppose you want to amplify and then measure because the voltage is very small ok
now, physical sources such as batteries maybe regarded as approximation to the ideal voltage sources
because these are meant for machines to read, machines to generate, machine to generate data and machine to read data
what is good for you
6375 kilonewton and now we need to know a approximate plastic section modulus to start with an approximate section so zpz required we can calculate from this formula which was proposed by the gaylord et al and according to that we need the zpz as 66 remember for finding out zpz required we need to put some assumed value of d by b so d and b we have assumed as this to calculate the zpz required so once we calculate the zpz required as 66
this is the magnitude, and it is angle is 40
so, and then ta inherits from faculty and student both, so this is the scenario
so, when i am showing it i think i have to show it for the sake of completeness i have to show this one, that is why little bit of right up is there, but i am not explaining that right because at this first year level there is no i mean no need
just hold on
97 volts
so, what we saw was the trapezoidal rule was for an integral from 0 to h; everyone is familiar by now h by 2 and the length from at 0 and the length at h right
i remember that is some 112
so this gives you a connection between electric field and the heat flow or the potential and the temperature
now we can what we call an even odd analysis to analyse this hybrid, to just give you a hint of how to do this analysis, let us see the what is this even odd analysis
so, you are because dielectric we are taking in between the parallel plates, but some conduction will be there because of that some r p will be there right that r p resistance we take right this r p
higher ratio will mean that their working capital is relatively ill liquid because inventory is not so liquid asset
nets not necessarily may mean two terminal nets, they can be multi terminal nets
in our si metric units, we use mm as numerical value for the dimension and this is the main communication to machinists in the production facility
so, now, let us see another case, we have seen the first case right where we have considered where we have considered that vgs is greater than v t
you can apply the patterns at the rated clock frequency, which can also help in detecting many delay related falls
when the itc manufactures as different products, you talk about the wheat flow they are manufacturing, different types of biscuits they are manufacturing, different types of chips they are manufacturing
so there is a lot of papers that can be read further for more information on the subject you will see that the content that i have covered here in terms of permeability and its role in defining concrete durability will be critical in understanding other durability problems like sulphate attack, corrosion and so on which will come across later in this course
nearly 75 percent of the buyers gather the maturity of their purchasing information online and four fifths of the customers use the web at least once a week to search for new information
you check for, as i said, manufacturability, electrical properties, reliability, verification, so everything passes
so, suppose you are making a painting or you are making something like customized product like say tailor made garment or if you are selling a car but it's not a normal car, it's a designer car which is extremely costly
43 into 285
so, with this we can bring this particular introduction to integral equations to end
so, m e star and m h star values are given they are equal to the mass of the electron
and, once the memory gets deallocated, the debinding happens
in that we know about drawing instruments how to use lettering, and what kind of papers, layouts we have to use for engineering drawing, and representing geometrical curves dimensioning and tolerances we will cover
that just to recap, these are the different ways to; these are the different ways to resolve the best function, exact match promotion and so on
if you write kcl at this node and; that means, this point, this is node 1 together because it is a wire
now, let us look at isometric view
so factory rent say reducing it from 5,000 rupees is not possible for us and we should not spend time on this, we should not waste time on this
we will study them one by one
similarly, at the bottom ones let us call a 1, b 1, c 1, d 1, and e 1
if you think of an overall system of object tracking, first of all you have to build an embedded system
so, we do not say such design should be the subject matter of a registered design because, they could be an aesthetic part to it, but if there is a functional part right holder will not go for a registered design
so, our goal is to place queens so that, they do not attack each others, so if we have a queen here then we cannot put another queen in any of the red squares, we have to put it somewhere else
and this will have a person, this will have a person other than that you will have different faculty data here, you will have the student data here, you will have the derive class this is the ta object
it is right before the return, but at the return it is not the previous statement, is not the next statement
this my reference point reference, current
now for n equal to one the question is trivial, because you only have to put 1 queen on 1 square
from the perspective of in indian who has been taught in a western pattern of a schooling and is also working in an organization, where a western oriented culture is dominant we find that the interpretations of eye contact would be talked about in this context
so, next is power and energy
one is called as direct inversion, the other is inheritance related inversion, and the third we call as avoidance related inversion
that is covered in the governance structure which is integral part of corporate governance
so, it makes it two dimensional; naturally if it is two dimensional, it needs two indices the row index and the column index to be accessed
the voltage across the capacitor was 0 at time 0 plus
so the essential idea behind calculating median is this, right
you will not reading this
for this line, we would like to bisect into equal parts; that means if i am calling this point as o; ao distance and ob distance are equal to each other and that we construct it based on another perpendicular line
so, e cross h is giving me the direction which the wave is moving ok
the fringing effect also disturbs the core flux patterns to some depth near the gap right
so, the first two sets of unknowns have captured everything that belongs to omega
so, if i am going to join this, this is the point a this is the point b if we are extending this a b line perhaps it might intersect at that point
your just rotate it this one by angle phi
it will be paid after two, three, four years due to certain provisions under tax loss
capacitance can be defined as the ratio of charge on 1 plate of the capacitor to the voltage difference between the 2 plates
zero means no connection
if it is a flow diagram and we saw that in rule 13, the only place where you can have words within a drawing is in the case of a flow diagram; other than that, the drawings will only bear numbers
so, this is the current waveform
it means we will be able to receive message here
so, how will the pointer move or in other words, how will theta change with time
so, for p 1 if i tell something about p 1 well in the context of p 1 self is p 1
now, this voltage is given
so if i make all this as this, then this is actually coupled to that i can look at exactly
so, here that big dash, small, again big one, small, big one, small and big one
maybe if i was have got and in which means the torque is a constant the torque to be developed by the machine is fairly a constant, so i can try to run the machine at whatever rpm or whatever speed i want provided, i actually adjust my armature resistance or externally i can include a resistance in the armature circuit
let us draw it as a front view and top view in the first quadrant
so, what do you think that i should do next
now, if you take for jj is equal to your one, two number of ah node branches, and if set m one is equal to ma, your isjj and m two is irjj
so, either use a global value which is a clutter which cannot happen if you are in a recursive call
so, if you want to calculate g of e at the bottom of the band
so, if it is a structure that is being used
so, if we have a positive vt transistor, this connection ensures that the transistor remains in saturation region
another trick is to think of the audience as sitting in a z formation
how can i pattern it
so, if i have r3 equals to r4 and c1 equals to c2, then my fc will be 1 upon 2 pi under root of r2c2, or 1 upon 2 pi rc what i am saying is that if you see this circuit, and if you see the formula for the critical frequency, the formula for critical frequency is fc equals to 1 upon 2 pi under root of r3r4c1c2, which is this particular circuit
budgets are the chief devices for compelling and disciplining management planning
so again we have to calculate e, b and then cross product of e and b
with a return to libc attack even though we have a stack which is non executable, still an attacker would be able to overflow a buffer and do something malicious
i don't think you will buy and sell cars every day
now coming to band pass filters
and where these assets are shown, these assets have to be finally recorded in the instrument called as the balance sheet
so exponentially the flux will decay
, equal to this is area of oqs minus opr plus dwm which is the mechanical energy
if i click ok it settles at this section, perhaps i would like to really make this section up and down
so, use these values in the given formula that i already have given you and then it will give you this values of ufp
you have seen through the various demonstration experiments that we have discussed so far
so we generally look at the per phase voltage ratios normally, we never look at the line voltages all though specifications will always or nameplate details on the machine will always give the line voltages and line currents and three phase kva rating
so, if we have an expression a plus b which is very common as you will see; i can think of this corresponding to operator plus, i can think of, there is a function whose name is operator the plus symbol
this is a very popular source of renewable energy
so what we see over here is that the radiation differs depending on what bit of the secret key is being executed
so, we are putting together all the building blocks, first we look at update equations space and time how do we update, then we put a material inside how do we handle a realistic material
but i want to connect a pin here with a pin here
35 now the reduction factor due to lateral torsional buckling the bending reduction factor xlt we can find so we know xlt is phi lt plus square root of phi lt square minus lambda lt square so and it has to be less than 1 so now if i put the value of phi lt and lambda lt i can find out the bending stress reduction factor xlt as this 1 by 1 plus uhh 1
suppose we have purchased one asset, say machinery for 1 lakh
what i can do is i can find out the relative change
delta function right
you have to sent, you are, information or a request to the fabrication facility to get in done
4 volt v 3 infinity 0 into 50 0 volt and applying kvl on the right hand mesh, you apply kvl on the right hand mesh, just do it know at steady state, you will get v 4 infinity is 100 minus v 3 infinity so it is 100 volt
so, advantage was accurate to second order right because its a centre difference ok
so, i have prefixed the keyword static in front of the data member declaration
word marks claim the right to use the word alone, or letters or numbers
so, over this entire domain this w should be w and this derivative should be square integrable right
swg 45 44
so, next is this is the notation this is the notation right
you will have to use such tools and, of course, you will have to follow some well defined design flow in order to control and manage the complexity of the designs
2008 was when universal declaration of ethics principles was endorsed and the international union of psychological sciences adopted the policy of on the free circulation of scientist in 2010
because the impact of every percentage will be huge amount of megawatt that is the reason
this is actually is equal to r e 2 per unit right and unity power factor load so, cos phi is equal to 1 right
so, under this method, the value of inventory slowly changes
then atmana, vidyata viriam
﻿ hello and welcome to this lecture in the course secure system engineering
we also have the dependent current source and the 0
the reason being; that if variation does not take place then what would happen that the likelihood of the survival of any species would be minimal if there is a change in the environmental circumstance
phasor diagram always shows all the vectors are rotating at 50 hertz
so, this fact is called a virtual sorting between vn and v p ok
now this cut would have to ensure is large enough to hold the entire flat jack that you have made, you have actually with you the fabricated flat jack but not too large compared to the flat jack itself
cantilever are essentially a very closest analogy
this is 45,000 is the operating profit divided by how many units
so look at this statement is now how convincing this statement is you are preparing the budget, you are comparing with the actual finding out the variances and in the last column they are giving the explanation
if the charge density of sigma time d omega r two square on this side is going to be d omega r two square sigma
let's look at the global effects of the frame infill interaction because of an irregular distribution of infill panels in plan
current is nothing but vth divided by the zth plus zl
of course, if i am doing this, then of course i can do the other way round, i can do a vehicle hierarchy again, which is basically based on the engine class
so, for your convenience that if you further want to refer the budget and budgetary control process and some other cases, some other problems and want to improve your knowledge, you always refer to the book that is management accounting by c
the beer lambert law says, that the change in intensity over a small distance dx and there is a negative sign because the intensity actually it goes down, is directly proportional to x and the proportionality constant is called μ
5, r f 2 50, i a 1 30 ampere, n 1 500 rpm right
and then in the main what we are doing, actually we do not require this
let us now apply this in two different situation and gives you very beautiful feeling for electrostatic cases also
so, across all the grid points i am doing this, i am drawing so many trail lines
so so, as i had said that these techniques try to exploit some changes at the algorithmic level, so we have not yet made the design again, these methods may not be very general, they may not be applicable to all designs, but for many of the designs which which appear quite commonly, you can use them like, for example, we will be illustrating these approaches with respect to design of a binary counter, how we can carry out state encoding in an efficient way for low power, then how we can carry out state encoding for finite state machines and clock gating in f s ms
so, this current is leading the voltage by 90 degree from this from this we can make it out easily right
so, there are some limitations of the cc limit which need to be reviewed
although, i am not drawing through the block, but they continue these are continuous flux lines these are magnetic flux ok; so, magnetic flux lines
so, now, this 7 ampere is your norton's current and 5 ohm is the norton's resistance which you calculated
this is a t implementation, this is a pie implementation
it may be broken, but adults do not want it to be broken, but glass is meant to be broken for a kid
so this is what it means in terms of a pore entry diameter
so, any time any place any point you take the derivative dv by dt will be 0
so, it is printing 1 now slowly, i will take away the light
we are going to do it slightly differently
it will become zero here
and can we design it with it with the help of operational amplifier,
we have looked at two stages so far, first was we got into the shoes of the customer or the user who are you are trying to help that was the empathize, you got to know them personally, you got to interview them, you got to know what they were going through that you can help out with
so these measurements can be taken in the same concrete prism over a period of time
so, you know a b h curve for a iron or mechanic material it looks like this
in this lecture i want to take one particular example that is similar to the example of a charges sphere or charge shell, similar to a charge shell, and i'll take this vertical axis to be the z axis, with sigma
so, we find 74 and we find that it has only one child
so, 3 by 2 units we are going to construct it
however, if an isometric viewpoint cannot be found that clearly depicts all the major futures; then we are permitted to use hidden lines
this load is for complete machine end this load is 50 per cent of the total force
so, this is this particular things here which is written, it this is not written in the table, it is not in the table, right
now if you want to memorize it as 14 different set of information, you are putting your short term storage in a big problem
now in another to determine the contribution of each independent source to the variable separately and then you add them up to get the final variable value
it is called absorbing boundary condition because it appears as what is absorbing everything that is going out
for example, many institutions prefer a ‘no touch norm’ where employees are alerted to this idea that they should not normally touch another human being and even a polite handshake is considered to be enough
third fault model which is the most practical of all is the multiple byte fault model
so that s11 will be the weight of this branch joining the 2 nodes, similarly this will be s21, this will be s22, this will be s12, fine
type def is a short form of type definition
that is the reason why you would see clearly may be initially, it may be somewhat linear but as it gets to larger and larger currents the saturation effect is much more pronounced because of which i am not going to see any increase in flux at all after sometime, but i would see a pronounced drop in the flux due to the demagnetizing effect, whereas magnetizing effect is really not going to be all that visible (18:51)
people is the most crucial element among the services mix
whereas, in python it will just happily go ahead and create a new value for that name and pretend that there are two names now while you think there is only one and create all sorts of unpredictable errors in your later code
by computing an addition of c1 and c2 possibly what we wanted to do is to wrap around because you go beyond the three constant 0, 1 and 2 that you had and we probably would have like to wrap around so that if you are adding 1 to 2 it should actually become 0 that is it should on increment come here and keep on going like that, but because the addition has taken me to integer, i have a result 3, there is no corresponding enum constant for that in my type definition
so we are sacrificing that material to protect our hull of the ship
so, we are at point number 5, where we have drawn a 45 degree line, this is 45 degree line from point f, and already we have located v f equal to v b
we do not know complete information about surface which we are intended or interested to construct
so from five we have reduced the delay to three
we have both characteristics in the same thing and we call this a full slice
but once you understand the process it is very easy for you to further understand what the process for 4 masks are
so, this is the this is the pointer the scale is not there because it is broken and this thing this copper like thing, it is not copper its actually phosphor bronze, it was this spiral spring
we typically prescribe that these are rigid horizontal diaphragms when they are being constructed and are capable of transmitting both gravity and lateral forces
so, the sigma d is defined on the compressed area and 0
now we define two terminologies: local skew and global skew
similarly, thus v thevenin is the open circuit voltage across the terminal as shown in figure 19 a; that is v thevenin is equal to v oc right
in his book digital body language, steven woods is the co founder and chief technology officer at eloqua
next would probably be either him continuing with what is already writing or him having to look back or check as to what he had written earlier relevant to that particular topic that was taught in class
since, we have a closed path through the external circuit, some current will flow in the direction of the emf
now let's see what are the durations for which the different inversions can occur and the tasks due to which the different inversions can occur
so, whatever if you if you looking to this diagram like here; so, we said that smod equal to 0; it is 64 and smod equal to 1, it is 32 similarly here smod equal to 0 is 32 and smod equal to 1 is the clock is divided by 16
so, it returns it in the form which is not exactly transparent, but it says that i is of class int
so, right is projected to left
this will be the your train right because you have connected if i c 4 is 0 it will remain as it is; that means, this i c current actually flowing like this flowing like this flowing like this throughout the source
this is my metal; metal i am just showing you the schematic do not worry we will we will come back to the process flow where you will see step in detail just look at the schematic
now, from this we can write v o in terms v n
and also give them feedback
if you have thickness of silicon over thickness of silicon dioxide, we discussed how you can measure the molecular volume by molecular sio2 where we saw this equation and found that it equal to 0
i am the teaching assistant to the course instructor professor rajaram in this course
and therefore i use the second expression in estimating the torsional shear for wall a
so now we have an estimate of sigma max where all that is done is x is substituted into this expression for n and i write it in terms of sigma max
you have to just simply put the value of v naught is equal to 0 in this case
it means that both of them will be short circuited
so, this way this is the sinusoidal emf generated
till now we had been discussing on the non isolated converters like the buck boost and the buck boost converters
but, if i wanted to if my information that if my question was where are the eyes i can still answer the question if my question is how many whiskers are there, i cannot answer this question right
so, if i say there is an array of int, then everything in that all value in that array has to be int
in cases, you cannot because of you want to mean something different or you want to mix up certain types and do some conversion, you will have to use the explicit instantiation
this entire incline portion, we are about to see it something like a projected rectangle
if i does not belong then the control comes here, then you put it that is add it to the list so this is what
so, all these things one has to your, one has to your, understand here had not much mathematics here only little bit theory an understanding
order n right; so, compare this with mom which is order n cube that is why this is fast
the easiest thing is, i mean you could calculate the entire transfer function with multiple capacitors all together
net standard output is how much
there is a boat which we have heated at high temperature and that is why the metal is getting deposited onto these 3 substrates
so this inverter delay will get added here
so, now, we have a p type semiconductor and we do this by adding acceptors n a and this must be greater than the donor concentration n d
so that is a positive aspect because he understanding and connecting what he is already learned with what is learning right now, so
we have already worked out the expressions for gm, kn, the current factor, times vgs minus vt or square root of 2 times kn times the drain current
so, i have to essentially derive point by point and then i should be able to basically get so, this was my second point, this was my third point, may be my external characteristics will be somewhat like this, and finally it may end up under short circuit condition, if i just short circuit the load terminals, voltage will be 0, if the voltage is 0, that means i am not getting any terminal voltage at all
so, if it is slip is one at that time it is e two, but when that rotor is running it has some slip
throughout the text or throughout this course we will follow the passive sign convention
now, the unknown resistance r x will be connected between these two terminals
the type is int
but even then the compiler gets confused and will tell you that the default parameter for parameter three has been redefined, it was already defined and it is being defined again and this will not be allowed
suppose i have a gate like this: output of this is going to another gate
since its vacuum, it is very simple its related by epsilon naught and mu naught not at all difficult
so the other way round solution can be applied here and can i instead of heating the environment which is what the air conditioning will do, can you think of lower cost ways to do it
so, if you put a 1 here at the input pin, then when you are doing this operation that is reading the pin
in the assets, we are already seeing the major examples of assets
now, draw x 2, y 2 again parallel to this project all this line to x 1, y 1 which we will get a line view and now, draw another xy x 2, y 2 plane parallel to this line view and project whatever the new view we got it
it yes you can, but your time would be a way lot more than a team working together and also the effort that they are putting it, because you would be a one standpoint for creation of everything
because the lagging current your this current is lagging, this this current is lagging because of the lagging current of the large motor a start
and these are very small programs run for a few microseconds, just few lines of code and incur very less runtime overhead
so, this is an inductor having a normalised impedance zl
so, one way of empathy could be you yourself going through that experience and figuring out, oh
because how much of control my leg can have, foot can have in terms of how much of pressing i am doing, it is kind of difficult
so, if we change that order this will be basically change
so, i am not going to derive this, but i will just give you information
so the microstrip line consist of a ground plane with a top layer metal with a sub strip comprising of some dielectric like teflon or glass epoxy or ceramic in between
the order of a
so, it is just and it is straight forward
so, just think of it like that yeah direct delta is a input and g is the response of the system to it ok, it is that function which satisfies this equation right
so, we will not study um generating mode, we will not study breaking mode also only this part
so, in this class we will continue our discussion on the thevenin's theorem but we will discuss more about the dependent sources that may be the voltage or current
so, in order to use this green’s function over here i should have another equation of the form what
that means any any angle theta can be written as e to the power j theta, right
do we know v n not directly, but we know something about v n
now this duration could be anywhere say from 1 week, few days or even a month and what we assume here is that this during this epoch period we have extensively tested the entire design so that no hardware trojans get triggered within this a particular epoch period
when the queue is empty, there have been no new squares added which are unmarked before they were added
1 degree, but it is your what you call it is lagging angle right ah and ah and if you talk of a compute v 4; v 4 is equal to v 3 minus i 3 z 3
so, if it for example, if it is 0 to begin with it will continue to be 0, this has nothing to do with fdtd, this what maxwell’s equation that telling me right
now, in that if you have to go to one step and change it, life is be very very miserable
and you see the capillary pores are decreasing very rapidly during that main heat evolution peak
77 micro farad
436 volts
unlike, what i had in the case of an induction machine
when another person touches us in a professional setting, it validates a positive feeling in most of the situations
nobody accept them as scientific because the same english or whatever languages being used by people who were nonscientific spiritual gurus of chaos
kyrlosker is the one, general electrical is the one, many private sector companies have come up in the field
if the two voltages match exactly there is no way, the bulbs can glow right but it is very difficult rather impossible for me to get the exact matching like that because i may think that it is 50 hertz actually grid frequency may be 49
so, in this case, your req is equal to 49 by 4 that is 7 by 2 ohm right i didn't written for that, but it is 7 by 2 ohm
so the original idea was ok
so, we have already located point v on that curve
so lets say wvdd, this weight, this weight of this line is eight and w and out is ten, w and in is three and ground is also three
so, this is actually your x 2 this is x 2
so, from case here that is ah ah that is i 1 is equal to i 2 i 2 plus i 3, this is equation we will substitute there in this equation, right
let us take one more example; if you are given a circuit where r=3
how, whether it is a socially celebrated, socially acceptable model of behavior which will help you attain the goal or any how you attain the goal and nobody will care what means was adopted to attain that goal
now, although the unit impulse function is not physically realizable similar to what we have seen in the case of ideal sources like ideal voltage source and ideal current source
now of course beyond all this there is a much more deleterious reaction which is a progressive loss of stability of c s h, now c s h you know very well is the adhesive phase inside your cement
as we said before python interprets init as a constructor, so when we call a object like p equal to 0
so, it , basically, it is sees the voltage
so, we have included the string class as in the header
we have seen how to do horizontal analysis by preparing a comparative statement where we compare the current figures with last year
but you can see that there is something in the volume which is being summed over right
so you have minus v not appearing across the inductor into 1 minus dts
you can say the delay estimate, like, like the interconnection delays, the gate delays or the cell delays and so on
so, it is all comes together very nicely alright
so that's why m into a, mass into acceleration is being brought in
so when you have class c fly ash in system, the expansion was less compared to the plane system
40 into 3
ok, so this is the temperature i am just visually putting it down and there is a band that you have associated
so that is the reason why it is generally automated but what we do in the laboratory generally is done manually
so, this should be true at all x,y right, and you notice that this k i dot r this is going to have terms like k i x x plus k i y y and these phasors are rotating in whatever in phase space and this expression should be true always
so, this time psychiatry and psychology are under tremendous pressure
it is a short; nothing here it is a short right
now, in the direction of the flux for this winding for this winding i 1 plus i 2 entering, so it direction of the flux that if you put there it is it is actually going like this, this is phi 1 and in this case now in this case what is happening, that current is leaving the dot right as the current is leaving the dot that in the direction of the current if i wrap it the way on the left hand side, right hand side, if i wrap or grabs the coil like this the direction of flux is upward that is why phi 2 is upward
the fixed cost is say expected to be 180,000 in case of the supervision was expected to be same for 7, 8 and 9 million level of the revenue
just for the sake of example, if suppose my work size is five, first bit indicates fault free
this initializes the board; what how do we print a board well for every row we sort the rows
so there will be a partition like this
in general we can say that the pause should never be accidental it should always be a part of careful planning in a professional dialogue
instantaneous power it will be definitely a product of instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current
so, 7 comparisons are required
in this particular lecture what we will look at is a new form of attack known as the return to libc attack
the right to copy in itself is not an end because why do you make these copies the copies are largely made to exploit for profit
if it has two children we have a hole we have a leaf we have a node which we have to remove value, but we have values on both sides below it and now we will use this maximum function maxval or minval in order to do the work
so, if i have a edge let us say over here this is not going to involve the edges far away those all going to be 0 we have seen that right
flip that rotate these things at suitable locations, fold, unfolding kind of thing, then we will have this complete picture on three3rd angle projection
these are phasors that are rotating
8006 into 100 kv
so, this way resonant will happen right, but when rl squarei mean is equal to rc square is equal to l by c the circuit is resonant at all frequencies right that also i told you because that factor tau will vanish right
we said already that ni equal to flux multiplied by reluctance, reluctance is really really low for an iron core
3d is the hardest because delta t has to be even finer right another the bounds on delta t are getting tighter and tighter
that is the reason why we considered that curve above the previous curve
so, no voltage drop occurs across the diode when the current is flowing in the forward direction
and now, as we know that at the when the derivative dp by drl is equal to 0 at that condition, the rl value what we get if you supply that value rl into the power p, power might be maximum or minimum
here is
if id is smaller than i 0, vd is actually increasing
and let us try to implement this peak detector on the breadboard, on the breadboard
so, we started from 1946, we reached to 1961
power switch, power switch ratings, diode ratings, prevailing diode rating, inductor design, so on and so forth
some text from the microcontroller board will be sent to my mobile phone through bluetooth
902 volts and at t is equal to 4 you simplify you will get 27
nice, now what is the next one, observe the output, v out you have to observe output, and note down the peak to peak value in the table below
if the constructor is not default, its call will require the parameters to be passed
and in this module we will especially cover about line projections
when the word specified compressive strength of masonry is used it is referring to the minimum compressive strength that the unit or the concrete must have
so this is a fourier series
so, general a very general model of this epsilon r as a function of frequency is what is discussed in this chapter 9 as a summation of various resonances
so, if you are given the state equations where you can find out the a, b, c, d coefficients or the coefficient matrices you can simply calculate the transfer function of the system
and it provides two channels, one for signaling for transfer of signaling data, and other for data channel
then no extraordinary item
and it was actually angle 0 degree by angle 60 degree numerator 0 degree denominator 60 degree that was actually coming 0 degree minus 60 degree is equal to angle minus 60 degree
so, what we are passing here is the file e3 which comprises of the payload comprising of the shell code that we want to execute and when we run this what we see is that it successfully creates a shell
example loan taken
one thing what was important over here was that the associativity of the cache memory, so recollect that this particular memory is an 8 way associative cache and therefore in order to create conflict with a particular set there should be 8 addresses following on the same cache set
there are the two conditions in the fourth formula
no, this epsilon r is for a homogeneous medium i mean epsilon r is not a function of space over here why because if epsilon r is not a function of space then i can safely assume that the solution is a plane wave correct
higher the elaboration, more are the chances that the newly derived meaning integrates with the existing memories
k is there so; we have substituted k also
3 water binder ratio system your pore entry diameter is close to about 0
there are three possibilities, positive transfer can be there
you see when the dividend is paid ahh what we do if we prepare the profit and loss account
ok, so now you allow these cells to grow for, i would say, two to three days
they are non sinusoidal because hysteresis is there, saturation is there
now, this is an example that we will be printing
so, we can see it from both sides, there is a core, circular core black in color which is held together with this outer magnet through this aluminium strips, which looks like a silvery object in on screens, so that is the core and between the core and the magnet we have this coil
what i am saying is that because we are laying out all the connections on the same layer, so i do not have any compulsion that the wires up to horizontal and vertical only, so i can also run the wires diagonally if i want
other theorists like elliot and maier have also suggested that the meaning of a particular color cannot be dissociated from the context or the environment in which it is encountered
so 10% of that will be 7,800 plus 250 the normal monthly rental will be considered in the cash budget for the month of january
the other type of rotor which we are yet to discuss, the second type of rotor is wound rotor or slip ring rotor
no when you say how do we get the equivalent circuit i have drawn a box which say za, but how do i know the value of za is
so, one tab is not going to be equal to three spaces or four spaces or whatever you see on the screen; and the more worried thing is the python will give you some kind of error message which is not very easy to understand
now, let we have looked at; we have looked at basically how do you deal with the finite difference time domain methods in space and time; space and time updates is what we have seen
we can see it again
monthly we will prepare
if you do not know that, then life becomes like that person who has a hammer; you know if you have a hammer everything, you see looks like a nail right
so, the rotor works exactly at synchronous speed or does not work at all
i am not saying its not possible to find it there will not be a closed form solution there will be a numerical solution ok
next step is we had to open a window right; that means that we will spin coat photoresist
now, this v n is constant v p is varying; that means, when this v p this input will be higher than 0 because this is always at 0 volt
﻿ hello everyone
this is one relationship which relates the voltage to many of the physical parameters
e x and e y are not at the midpoint of the grid, but at the midpoint of the grid line not in the middle of the cell
and i was just lucky to be in the right place at the right time
for different materials like copper, aluminum, there is a particular current density that is allowed as a standard, so an international standard
assign this is same, same as count is equal to 0; i is equal to 1; and plist is empty
it will definitely lag behind the voltage alright maybe by 80° may be by 75° not 90°
now join these lines by a free hand curve
so, that is address bus is 16 bit
and what is the current i test
now we have to find out aw
so, the current through this which is equal to i1 has to be vs minus v1 times 1 by rs or gs which is the conductance
ok, so here what i am saying is that this the process of global placement
and then of course, it will have communication capability
let us now summarize what we have learnt so far
so now we can find out the eccentricity eccentricity will be how much it will be 150 plus 100 minus 25 that means it will be 225mm right
the feedback can also be seen in very interesting way for example, if you see this particular image number one where the user submits some solution for the assessment
give them a fictional name
so, this is this your what you call that i2 dash
this is one scenario
so, this is the result of the operating budget which is based upon estimating, planning for the sales and the production, including the distribution
so whenever full adder, the sum can be defined as this boolean equation, or a, x or b, x or c, and the carry is defined as a, b or a, c or b c
yes, will it obey radiation boundary condition yes, at the remember the boundary gamma is a mathematical imaginary boundary; we do not want any field to come back from it
so this vdd and ground lines are already connected horizontally
gallium arsenide minus 6 to minus 2
on the other hand, let us look at a vector field which is constant all over and let me take this path here
so you will have nv in, n v in into d will will be the output v0 because this is a buck converter operation
so, the fields in empty space or vacuum they are denoted by the 0 under script right
in this case although diagram i have taken these all these things i have taken from book right, but this is a n pole, this is n pole, this side is l, and this side is m right and this is your n and this is your p already marked here
so, i will bring e n to one side and everything else to the other side right
similarly, for somewhere here here you can take another point here for theta is increasing this is the theta, right
so, how we got this word
so, the gist of the rome convention which dealt with protection of performers, producers, rights of performers and producers of phonograms was also brought in through article 14 of the trips
we can always write something like
so, if you see this you will simply get i 4 is equal to minus of i naught, ok
gain frequency
we should never be in a hurry to conclude about the intentions of feelings of the other person simply by looking at an isolated kinesics movement
so the set of things that we can do with strings, last, in the previous lecture we looked at other things we can do string like, find, replace and all this things, so this is like that, it is in the same class
so, in this problem, we will now deal with the problem of the per unit cost
so, if you are given this circuit as shown in the figure, it has v c equal to minus 1
sorry there is no dr
let me write this as m, l common point and this is the v
where do the medium properties going to
so, this is hope you have understood this is v thevenin this is r thevenin it was ask to find out v thevenin, we will got only one thing i have to tell you here we got v thevenin is equal to minus 100 volt right that is why this plus polarities at the bottom and minus is here right
so, i should be able to get what is the value of r2 so that so let me write the value like this
so, you can add y with unit gain so that you can have the clear understanding from the state diagram
so, you have increased both na and na 10 times, but the ratio is still the same
the commonality between food and language can be understood easily because food is also a code which expresses patterns about social relationships and cultural backgrounds
now, consider that when the voltages on both are the same, if the voltages on both the lines are same, then this central capacitor does not play any role, so the total capacitance between the top metal on the bottom metal is simply ceffective is equal to c 11
so, because of which i am looking at the flux getting modified
we are looking into the stack having private data and the container that contains the elements of the stack is dynamically allocated array therefore, we just have a pointer
will use different techniques for three phase power measurement
so, in olden days the reason we have, you might ask me what is the difference between the coupled and the through port
and they coated that titanium with mixed metal oxides which made it as conductive as they could get it
they, they, are not intelligent
whereas series please note it is having a voltage division between armature and field whereas here there is no voltage division i am having the entire voltage applied here, so i may apply may be with the help of another resistance to adjust the current i may have some vdc applied here and that vdc may be whatever is the rated voltage in my factory or in my laboratory or whatever
again, it is very difficult to fake this expression
and we will see that it is still following there is no problem
now the profit before tax, only 5% but very good profit both for gujarat pippala and g
so, what is v out by v in, 10 by 1, that is 10, that is 10
ok, so for high performance design, particularly for the clock net, we need some sophisticated analysis and very accurate routing tools so as to control the skew and jitter ah parameters of the clock
the difference already i have told you
so your dependent source value will become now 5 i0 dash
so, now, we will find the magnitude of this force
so, that budgeted profit and loss account here if you want to arrive at the organizational profit or loss you have to calculate that profit at the each and every product level
it also depends on the datasheet; what kind of order it is to use in the data sheet is already mentioned
so here we are talking about a cpu, a processor which is executing instructions
so, i is equal to 6 ampere; that means, this one is equal to your 1 by 6 into 6 write in here that is your 1 ampere this is 1 ampere
it depends like for how many units you are producing, which community wants that device, how will you market it such that the importance of the device goes to the huge customers
so, this is how we can change the range of an ammeter and therefore, we can actually if you have a meter with fsd current 10 milliampere we can measure any current larger than 10 milliampere by using suitable shunt resistance
and the minimum requirement, minimum steel requirement is as prescribed
i am not touching this metal
so, that is how hence the word finite element method lots on lots of finite elements make up this whole method
the first universal emotion which has been mentioned by ekman is happiness
call by reference; they have to be identical
so, within that there could be multiple declarations and statements specifying the function body
so, z equal to 0 first of all i need to now impose a boundary condition here otherwise how will i terminate the wave
if i can show that an accelerating charge, give me a propagating disturbance which goes as for which the e field is, one over r is perpendicular direction of propagation i have shown in the radiation
so, in this case, when the profit we are calculating in the cost sheet, that profit is called as operating profit
but some of the nets clock and power are of course obvious once
so, what we will do is we will calculate this as a percentage to the base, that is to the last year
now this aes implementation also takes as input a clock source as well as a reset signal
so, if you take if you if you take the diagram same diagram right just hold down if you take the same diagram same diagram
so, voltage actually that is your v 12 actually dw of dw by dq the w is the energy in joules and q the charge in coulomb
if you see from this band diagram, this whole thing is e c, this is e v
and it happening in simultaneously
now if some programmer started using point in the days when we are using x and y and started manipulating p dot x and p dot y directly outside the code
so now we will be continuing with our discussion on bist
so, when the alternative values of assets are available, accountants need to choose the one which leads to lesser value
when we are looking at that this center is at 35 mm above and this arc when we are looking this entire thing comes at r 35 r35 arc because this height is 35 and from there 35 mm we have it
so, voltage vgs equals to 3 volts for vgs equals to 3 volts right, where is it vgs equals to 3 volts somewhere here for vgs equals to 4 volt somewhere here 6 volts here, 8 volts here, 9 volts here or 7 volts here
if we have zero inventory with us of the raw material then certainly for the beginning of the production we will first purchase the inventory from the market and then we will go for starting the production which is not the case in the current situation
the general rule for the range function is that you start with i and you increment or decrement if k is negative, in steps of k such that you keep going as far as possible without crossing j
and we assume that the context which overhead in the worst case is 1 millisecond
of course most of the important ratios are on the side of p&l where a different type of ratios can be calculated on p&l
so, in the last two lectures we had actually looked at how one particular vulnerability in the stack can be exploited by the attacker
the same voltage is v load
so, what to do if there are some limitations
and it creates a rotating magnetic field which rotate at a synchronous speed your what you call ns right
no power supply is given during braking, already eb was there, eb was there because of the field current and the speed, the field current still you are having if it is a separately excited dc motor you would continue to give the field supply, whereas, yeah
what we have to do is first job in the budgeting is to prepare the budgets, then collect the actual information and then calculate the variances
so, similarly your same concept same concept or same philosophy will be ah v will be applied here and later will come what is load frequency control right
so, you have a slender wall but if you have this is a top story wall or if it is a single story structure and the wall aspect ratio is such that it is slender, you can still have a flexual mechanism but it will not fail in crushing but it will rock
now since this three are in series zs and zl and be load impedance z capital l you can club all of them as zy is equal to zs plus z small l plus z capital l were zs is the internal impedance of the phase winding of the generator
here the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band have the same value of k
quantities in electrostatics
similarly what are the algorithms used for freeing the memory
similarly you draw just 120 degree part between among your what we call between your line current as well as when you draw the phase current these are all this phase current 120 degree apart right
so, this is what we have already discussed
so, we have to do a scan for each i j in this scan in general adds up to an order, order n factor and so we have order m n squared or order n cube if you like
of course, the choices up to the designer or the person uses it
so the relative impact of the interconnection delays started to increase and today we have a situation where the interconnection delay is becoming pre dominant as compare to the gate or cell delays
if you looked at the length of the diodes on the p and the n side on the n side the diode length is 100 on the p side the diode length is 5 micro meters
so, if you see the updated circuit here you have the t circuit of the, t circuit given in the question
all these equations will be like this and your and ultimately your equivalent circuit will be like this right
and you see that this base is coming connected with two bts
707 that means 2 point 85 by 0
so, that we can dope p type material so that we can dope in this area p type material right
any way if you know that there are certain points in your house through which a person can enter; the door there is a lock and someone has to break that lock and have to enter, or it can be from some windows anyway you have to break that window
so, if you multiply and simplify all these things; v 2 actually coming 0
so, n 2 will be 387 rpm, this is the answer for n 2
so, you can see how silicon substrate looks like and we will also see several techniques that are used to fabricate this integrated circuits
suppose, i have an example
so, we can represent the newton’s law of motion as we say that the total sum of forces applied on the body equal to m into a, where m is the mass and a is the acceleration which is in the direction considered
so earlier what we derive was the average power absorbed by the circuit which is excited by a sinusoidal signal and we express them in the form of voltage rms voltage and current
so, there is a lot of work thatt needs to be done to just get one small thing
how long should it be
any lines what we are seeing this supposed to be intersection of surfaces; that means, we have idea about what are the surfaces connected with each other; for any continuum analysis like designing the objects, one of the popular numerical method what we call in engineering finite element analysis
so, if this is sufficiently greater than zero; that means, it is outside the resolution than then, then v o is equal to plus or minus v supply depending on whichever is higher ok
now, first understand what is mass
we can see planes say supposed for this we have to go on this hide and show items click on planes, we can see the front plane right plane
so, if i am outside of this class then the name of this function is b colon colon f
so, what is the what will be the your what you call that r value and x value look , j is equal to you can write , 0 plus 1 into j this we write; that means, 0 is equal to you can write cos pi by 2 , right and 1 you can write j this j is there j sin pi by 2 right
this function we called translate
e s z correct ok, like this there is 1 2 1 between all 3
this is a given problem right this is a given problem what is the problem that for non inverting amplifier is there and it has a gain of 100 and it is nulled at 25 degree centigrade
just to complete this table, we will also do a similar calculation for germanium then we can come back and fill in the values for n i in terms of centimeter cube and also conductivity
so, once that is constructed, we can just remove that there is a hole here
if i am going through this when i am 0 when i is 0 i have ampersand percent e 1 which is an employee pointer
so, one thing is a flaw in the design, example, we have a processor and a processor as we know, is a highly complicated or highly complex design
then ceos and cfos must certify the periodic reports for truthfulness and accuracy
for example, you randomly select a new location to move but you find that already the new location is occupied
so, what can i do over there
now, step function is used to represent an abrupt change in voltage or current
so now we are going to do two things we are going to include it in the cash balance
in the end, we have learned the we have learned about basic, basic kinds of mating that is needed for assembly of different parts for product for product design
so, this is sort of brief review of linear algebra that we will use ok; because the whole method of moments is a very very nice tool from linear algebra only, it uses basis vectors and it uses inner products nothing much nothing more complicated in that is this fine so far
707 angle i 0 angle 45 degree similarirly i 2 is equal i 0
and they also had terms like time derivative, so there is a derivative in space and there is a derivative in time; and so the simplest thing you can do is to find out what is the relative weight of these two derivatives
and that is this point o
so after doing this cut, you divide
so lap splicing provisions also have to be accounted for
f now means about the inputs
that is the first portion and another portion is going to be h g l g divided by n multiplied by n a d b, right
okay, now again what we see over here is just like setmylib int, the address for the mylib int is all set to 0
so, if you look at this carefully if i print j and star p j, j is a variable p j is the pointer to this variable, star p j is certainly has to be same variable value
last class we started looking at junctions
i am not venturing in to that area, but if you look at the whole story of psychoanalysis and explanation of areas types of clinical diagnosis
i can define a final temp, lets say final temperature, i can define as a point five
so, suppose this is polarity test
5 we have got two ways to do this masking one is d i, e i another is by using the sim instruction, so we know that there is the individual flip flop for enabling disabling of these rst s, so they can be utilized is in the sim instruction and d i, e i will be affecting the interrupt enable flag so as a result entire thing will be disabled, trap cannot be masked so this is the only non maskable interrupt that 8085 has
so this is split ring a now which is connected to b2 previously b was connected to b2 and a was connected to b1 now b is connected to b1 and b2 is connected to a
these two coefficients are given
so, all the good nice pictures are done finally, you have to come back to maxwell’s equations right
so, by constructing this it is piecewise linear and what is the nice property that you can see coming out of this, the function given by the green curve is
this elmore delay module is one of the most widely used delay models, which gives quite realistic delays but also at the same does not consume too much computation
depression, but having said this; there are certain illnesses which i think we should mention so that people are able to recognize it are purely illnesses actually
similarly, if you make v 1 too much negative then this term will be too much positive
so because of these multiple types of pollutants the concrete quality gets degraded, but then there may be some variations in the type of sulphates that are actually attacking the concrete you may have for example sodium sulphate, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, iron sulphate these are all species of sulphates that may enter the concrete
that means, for example, i want to construct a by skill, maybe i want to construct something like a pen, what i will do is i will prepare a cap, i will prepare a refill, i will prepare something like bottom portion, save individual parts, then carefully load it, tighten them, so that a combined part like a pen can be made
what is bad in it
so, root 3 v, this is i, and this is cos phi and divided by 1000, so 10 to the power minus 3 so it is kilo watt right
matter in the way he is doing his particular activity, yeah i think that might be something
so, the point is, how can we find the solution to it
the 2nd device which we discussed was nonreciprocal, lossless and matched at all ports, that device was called a circulator
so, if the eccentricity is e, you already have p into e acting in addition to the, p into e acting on the wall, which would mean there is a component that's just the gravity load p plus a moment acting on the wall
this guy was what was it constant or a function of space
today i am going to just explain how the colorimetric test can be useful in the assessment of carbonation resistance in concrete mixes
and, then we have bearings which i have shown here, but let me now draw it
what is the start phase
and what do i do, i do a very simple trick instead of just adding, which is the behavior that we were getting here, instead of just adding, we add and then modulo 3, 3 is a number of symbols you have
so in this particular case, i can directly write this as n times i
so, in case of the production budget, we will see the inventory budget
3 centimetres in this direction, 5 centimetres in this direction; that means, if we are drawing this one x y plane above that locate a point a’ call this one o project it
one thing what we have to notice
let me just rewrite those two expressions, this n c exponential and p is n v exponential minus e f minus e v over kt, we can mark the position of e c and e v in the band diagram
there are very less serious risks
so, we start fibonacci of 5 as usual, it says do 4 and 3, 4 says do 3 and 2, 3 says do 2 and 1, 2 says do 1 and 0
hence we call them learning dialogues
typically we use we are not in the business of constructing new basis functions
now, if we want to reach this its very clear that i can only come all the way along the top row or all the way up the rightmost column, there is no other way i can reach them
so, if i rearrange this i need not rearrange this
what is a gain
you see which are the blocks you can see
and, here you see the function invocation or function call, where we are using two parameters that are local to
and there is a pointer attached to it which moves along a scale, what we can do, we can connect a vein like this
there are eight cuts i am showing here together
this current is say i a right, this current is say i b, and this current is say i c right
so when this is freewheeling this is pulled to the ground
so, we will take net profit after tax and although the salaries of employees has increased quite healthily okay so this was an attempt to do to show you how a detailed analysis is done by especially the analysts who are trying to study a particular company in detail so in next session we'll try to take the other
a new asset that is receivables is added
so, to draft and file patents and to answer objections raised by the patent office with regard to an applicant, application, you need to be a patent agent; a registered patent agent
for examples ferroresonance in transformers, subsynchronous resonance is the more pronounced right during motor starting, shutting of motors during normal operation, and difficulty in protection of capacitors; series capacitor of course from system fault current; series capacitors do not have large application in distribution system
then we try to store it and if we have successfully stored it then whenever needed we will like to retrieve it
so, he went to great detail and detailing what their environment might look like, so, this is a kind of detail he wanted students also to do in a real life, and this is a great case study for them
if so, then we remove it, this we can either write self dot next is equal to self dot next dot next or we could even just write self dot next is equal to none which is probably a cleaner way of saying it because it can only happen at the last node
this is the load right this very clearly tells me that there are 4 parallel paths in the current if i may call this as i by 4 this is i by 4 this is another i by 4 and this is i by 4 and the total current drawn here is i
so, you can get those things fabricated which is not a big deal trust me, or you can get a coarse one and then you can gold plate it and you know make it sharper, and several things you can do there a lot of zone for innovation tremendous zone for innovation what you can work through
otherwise all other ratings will be according to the bug boost waveforms
two pi r c, pi a square, pi s square
so, you get the total of current assets and then total assets, which is total of nca plus ca
so, we can substitute the numbers
first we need to decide on the data type of the element, define a structure or container, for actually defining that in c we will need to use some maximum size, otherwise the c compiler is not allow us to define it, declare a top variable which will maintain the top of the stack and then we will need to write the four functions that are typically required for the operations of that stack
even if we make it a small variation in terms of fixing it like mechanical stresses perhaps might twisted
thus, we can realistically assume that voltage at the non inverting terminal of the op amp is equal to the voltage at the inverting terminal
what happens in the case of a exemplars okay, these are once again the best example that would come to your mind
so, just; so, one last thing i’d like to draw your attention to is that there are two different parts of this magnetic field, one has a 1 by r dependence and the other has a 1 by r square difference
these drafters can be of different types also;, the simple drafter which we call mini drafter is shown here
so i think time factor is a question here again
so for high performance circuits in chips the placement algorithms will allow inter connection of the nets where some timing constraints maybe
now, who are the promoter groups in reliance
so for example we want to allocate this particular chunk then we ensure that the previous node or the previous chunks forward pointer points to the next chunk forward pointer similarly the next chunks back pointer points to the previous chance pointer
for example, if f is equal to frequency is 50 hertz and p is equal to say 4 pole machine, that p is equal to 4 no question of pair only poles
and here is the problem uhhh we have small problem and we will evaluate the cost to uhhh the cost to this particular company
see again let us see this condition
so for the uncracked portion of the wall, for the uncracked portion of the wall, the total eccentricity is the eccentricity of the load plus the deflected, the deflection at that section
using a simple if you just write a program in matlab, you can easily find out using nerical methods the value of omega r
so, this is known as ac coupling and the way we connect rl to the transistor is exactly the same as our original common source amplifier we connected through a capacitor
unless we make a cut section remove this first part and show something like, where sheet metal can be represented by a thick line; that indicates that material might be present within that red portion and the white portion, there is no material
you square equation sixty three and sixty four and you add it
ah
so, first thing which we have to understand is that how we can convert the various circuit elements from time domain into s domain
so, that is the reason we show it in parenthesis
so, we undertake this agile method of developing products, instead of a waterfall design this is always much more better; life is way more simpler
similarly, the other end of the line also projected suitably connect these projections; that is the way we will be in a position to join the projections onto different planes
therefore, this your in general a voltage drop from 1 to 2 is equivalent to the voltage rise from 2 to 1 meaning is same
that is using a sacrificial material which would take on the brunt of all the corrosion and still protect the material from marine life so we needed that desired result for these two
so, let us just write down some notation over here
rotor is not moving n is equal to 0
you can see a set of wafer loaded into the furnace
the solution earlier obtained showed you in proper limit because you have distance while solving a this, what you know, there may be some radially current through the voltammeter
these caves are 2200 years old at least as i have already mentioned
so you can imagine basically that if i am going to have the magnetic pole like this i am going to have the magnetic pole extending only until the machine ends after that wherever i have a conductor the conductor is going to bent like this and then come back like this this overhang portion becomes useless
and gamma 1 is the mismatch between this beginning sections z0 & z1
we have seen some methods or techniques which can be use at the level of gates, or at the so called atrial level design
so, this tells us that when the program continues this is the assumption
so when i have want to come to minus 10 ampere, now this current that i am pumping in, will create an extrinsic flux which is definitely in the opposite direction, but it has to do some work on these magnetic domains and realign them
so, this is a i mean unwanted reflection
now, second case is, it is i hope i am not marking it by pen i think it is simple think
then we talked about storage of the cylinder at specific location where the cylinders have to be ensured that those cylinders are properly hooked with chains or clamps
we had called it back then we had called them parallel polarization and perpendicular polarization depending on whether the electric field vectors in the plane or perpendicular to the plane right
so what we can do, we create one super node which includes v 1 and v 2 and we will apply kcl for this super node
so, when we do memoization when we come back and recursively explore it will never ask us to come here because it will never pass these boundaries
so, it means now how much is the total amount available
so, total ncl is 2328
so, what i am plotting is the value of this objective function s minus g s u x
once that is done, we can convert this rectangle which 50 dimensions, again we have
so, how do we go about realizing this
so that is the end of that part, thank you
so, everyone is let us go back to our weak form over here right further still yeah here is the weak form right
so, up to 20 mm we would like to have this thread and 1
at this point you take you open the specimen or autopsy the specimen and determining the amount of chloride at the steel surface
so, the z axis any point any line parallel to the z axis is tangential to the surface
so, what if i take now think of extending this there are going to be four adjacent grids, four yee cells right what should i do
so, if we are looking at carefully, the machine gear where these teeth will be joining with the other teeth let us look at that part
now since these two elements are in parallel, so you can take the parallel combination of these two elements and you can find out the impedance
so, this is r x and now let us call r internal equal to total internal resistance of the circuit total internal resistance of the circuit ok
first one is the say quantity number of units we want to sell in the market and second is the price at which we want to sell in the market
for t less than 0 this switch is open, so we found that the initial current which is flowing through inductor is 4 ampere
so, i will say va, another voltage source probably
and we will see there are several programming situations, there are several problems for which having such a static data member would really help
so, sub broad approaches we are talking about now one by one
so, supposing this is your computational domain right
251 a2
the first correction factor, so that's what the stress strain curve would look like
so, the mid frequency range has wave like solutions ok
as we have already seen ray birdwhistle had developed the studies of kinesics and edward t
so you can see immediately that a dot d s is indeed l cubed and that confirms this divergence theorem
one thing which was required that is the actual price per kg of the input that was not available so we have found it out
because, there is magnetic current is on the is a pure surface current it does not it is not either here nor there is exactly on the boundary right
so, this is what we have seen so far
so, let me include that as well and draw a schematic of the laser structure
so today we will look at healthcare services and other professional services
in this case because the performance has changed budgeted was 3,000 80,000 actually is 4 lakhs
now, let us go to the next part that is liability
there would be some phase difference
this is a simple ratio, current assets divided by current liabilities
so, we were here working capital turnover ratio which is sales upon working capital
so, if you primarily remove the axial load, the axial stresses due to the self weight and any superimposed load from these expressions you should be able to get the loads corresponding to horizontal bending and crack formation under horizontal bending
so, we have that hollow cylinder
so, the algorithm is same in respective of which overload which we use, but since c++ is strongly typed for every version, we need to have a separate code we need to have a separate version of code which will work the code for int will not work for double and so on
wwhen i when i ask him to press power button, he will press it
apart from with these values and this will give you a feel for what you what to expect in a real circuit on the oscilloscope
so, if you put tau is equal to c r, so c by tau is equal to c by c r; c, c cancel, it will be 1 upon r that is why v s upon r e to the power minus t by tau right
so, if i take d psi by d r that is what i want to worry about d psi by d r psi is any function, i can write it by chain rule as d psi by d x d x by d r right
the point to keep in mind is that the name is themselves do not have fixed types they are not assigned types in advance
that is, v 0 is smaller than what is required, what is desired
now, through the voltmeter as well which was not flowing previously through these previously when the voltmeter was not there
observe the moment i have inserted this ammeter in this circuit this voltmeter is not measuring the voltage across this resistance
so, now look the example, so in in ah figure this is 41, the switch has been in a position a for long time thism that means, if you look into the circuit that, this is this was in this position for long time at position a, this is a right
so, that's why we must know the present value
for instance a person publishes the book when he publishes a book he becomes the copyright owner of the book by a mere act of adding the copyright claim on his book he just puts the copyright symbol which is a small c within a circle © and writes his name the authors name and followed its by the year in which he writes the book
in order to understand what exactly is the emotion which is being conveyed, we have to look at accompanying kinesicbehavior
so, in that case your what you call this is the current flowing your through this is i 1 and current suppose if load is connected, this is i 2 and this if you take in this direction, current will be i 1 minus i 2, but i have taken in this direction
so, case study has all those advantages
so, if you can come back to the screen,i will show it to you how it looks like
because the idea is to pattern the metal
it is going to be interesting, it is going to be very interesting
now, at every stage we check whether any line from the set l s, whether the intersect l, t or naught
in next session we will discuss the case where we have dependent voltage or dependent current source is also available in the circuit
historical cost is the one is the actual cost which has already happened and it can be used as the guiding factor or the base level factor
in the upper case, in the labor rate of pay variance, rate went inside the bracket and that actual time came outside the bracket
so, when a line is inclined to both vertical plane, horizontal plane, we have to use this kind of projections to construct this front view and top view of the system
we will see here this mate selections has a window, small window we have to click on that and select the faces we want to do we want to mate
welcome you all for the lab session of bond characteristics of prestressing strand
now interestingly so, the embryonic day starts from say e0 to say e22 when sorry, this is actually not calling run it is called fetal
65 volt right
then what will be the effective load here
so, to do that we have our s212 as 1 upon omega 6
so, 1 upon i f 2 is equal to 46 upon 30, but i f 2 is equal to 250 upon r plus 250 right
i mean what i did i bring this point bring this point here right; that means, 40 and 50 in parallel because no other electrical element is here
for example, if we maintain a positive body language, then gradually our emotions would have a positive shift
then the limited disclosure of the main result with that is the what of the technology can do the work rather than disclosing how the technology works, the details of how it works
there are certain reservations about its applicability particularly in those organisations, which are focused on learning and related with development of human beings
so therefore the reading which we get from watt meter w 2 will be 0
so, that will be the strategy that we will solve
the mission of an ip centre could typically be something like this to serve and assist researchers in the transfer of institutions research results to industry for commercial application, consumer development and public benefit
so energy flow out will be s, dot d s
then it sometimes works as a good strategy you can use a pen or a pointer an gradually bring this in front of the eyes of that person, gradually you would find that the eyes of that person are focused on this pen and gradually this pen can be brought to the point which you want to illustrate
the remaining two, seventy degree, you are not propagating the waveform
so, what we are assuming u constant
so, your discretization is 30 centimeters say by 10 3 centimeters or even smaller than that let us say a 1 centimeter
so, that is why if you see here, it between cd the polarity of e is of minus is on the top and plus is on the bottom
now what is the duty ratio
so here the clock will be coming to the flip flop only for those instances where the applied d value and the output q stored value are different
the fourth point is better functional performance
sorry, i wrote the whole thing again let us write this
so, you are actually doing something which is kind of illegal and goes against the basic premise of const ness that you have built up
so in the final position, the total force exerted on the block b four will be equal to zero
so now, once it bounces back, you can track it by having a position sensitive device or some kind of a device here which will see at what angle this laser is bouncing back
similarly, you would like to write some text on your drawing sheet
further purpose we require this french curves and this french curves are segments made from euler spirals; part of the euler spiral will be taken, and this french curve will be made and meant for drawing free form of curves
so, let us look into example
so we can solve this equation easily
let us note it a this this one is a, this one is b
so, slicing the cone in the horizontal direction, one can make it
but we said ok, we will use the same anodes in both cases just to learn
i will write this an abbreviation dos
transistor like that and the transistor is connected across this and looks complicated but not so
once this hp lies in plane with vp, the avp is rotate about x1y1 line
let us see what section 31 of the patent act says, it says that it is possible for a person to make a disclosure provided the disclosure as a description of the invention in a paper, read by the inventor before a learned society
so, if you have the luxury it is better to put transmitters everywhere i mean receivers everywhere so that you can collect all of the information that does not come back to the transmitter
but in the process, it undergoes priority inversion
here we are writing a function for c using struct this is a global function, which computes the area of the rectangle
and this is equal to v potential at infinity, minus potential at z zero
this extends, list1 to be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
as i had said, that this strategy is difficult to implement in general
so, total purchases were 27,500 minus 22
we also need some more some more other sensors to be attached to the object to receive some more data
but, now each frequency has its own velocity right; if you look at this curve over here well not in this curve, but for different every different omega will have a different k
the way to think about it if you want to pictorially is that i have this number m and i can break it up into units of n and then there is a small bit here
we are not, so far, going into fdtd implementation just total field is incident plus reflected
so, let me put a reverse arrow, but output will remain positive because output now the output is already positive and when the output is positive what is the rule
now, this slit is much bigger than the wave length of light
so i am going to have the squirrel cage bar arranged around the outer periphery of the rotor and it is going to be short circuited the same way
so, because of that easiness usually we go with first angle projection system
so whether you use first method or second method, you will get the same result
his study describes how lies vary in form and can differ from other types of misinformation
so if i look at how much is the mechanical energy output when there is no movement, this will be zero in the absence of movement
in her idea the haptic experience is not only related with the way we touch each other
right nnow this what ac voltage is this
but just for this case, 1st we will be deriving our prototypes for these idealised values and then we shall be finding the transformation or how to transform the circuit so that we get whatever impedance matching we want and whatever cut off frequency that we want
the five common mistakes which have been referred to by carol goman can be listed over here, which we tend to make in interpreting body language of other people
r l and 4 ohm this things are as it is right
everyone comes up with their own word for it they all mean the same thing ok
tradeoff means we can have, in the extreme case, two different kinds of trees
so, primary turns n 1
for example, this is a haskell style declaration
now, if you compare these two circuits you can say that z11 minus z12 is simply equal to 20 ohm and z12 is 40 ohms
so as a blue waveform, so whenever q1 is on, you will have this kind of a thing
so let us first concentrate we’ll see how we can achieve all these targets this noise stability and gain but first let us suppose we are concentrating on the gain aspect so if i want to achieve the maximum gain then what should it be
so, the reverse saturation current is essentially a really small value
if, we have a pyramid take a slice, this is the pyramid it might be right angular kind of thing vertically making 90 degrees
it has been well documented in several of the recent earthquakes in the last few decades that the bare frame, if the bare frame did not have, if the frame did not have infills, infill panels, it could have failed
so, that is fixed all the times, see 100 rupees to 100 rupees, 500 rupees commission of the broker and the cost of the people working in the cash department
one drawback of the pass transistor is that it can incur some voltage degradation
so, the solution to this can be obtained as a superposition of this where we have only vi applied to the network and this where we have only v10 applied to the network
now, this is a good time to introduce one concept there is quantity called as the scatter field you all heard this word scattered field
so we can actually clearly see that there are some cache sets where clearly cache misses are always observed
minus beta from your complex number right that is that i beta is equal to i e to the power j beta right; that means, if we take it is conjugate then it will be i e to the power minus j beta we are taking the conjugate
so, normal line energizing or de energizing, high speed line reclosing; so many things are there
it says, the name f will be interpreted as a function which takes some arguments and does something
and so, when i print according to this print method then the value that i get printed is 35, because the static object is shared by the both objects
so, you will simply replace the unknown that is linear to terminal network with the norton's equivalent
this fellow pushes it this way, the other fellow pushes this way, and the net force is 0
c and which is as shown over here it has mylib int, setmylib int and getmylib int to set and get functions and the driver for this as before is here which has an invocation to setmylib int and getmylib int
initializing the board says that first of all for every key for each of these sub dictionaries queen row column north west south east south west or north east we first set up a dictionary with that key
so, for example we have a very complicated circuit over here let us say for example cryptographic algorithm and we want to ensure that this cryptographic algorithm does not have any trojans
now as we go away from the load, the phase of v+d or v d changes by jbeta d only
the instructors stating that he or she is going to be teaching about the molecular composition of cells is not an effective learning outcome, since it is not coming from the learner’s perspective, but from instructor’s perspective which is not desired
nill in the month of january, nil in the month of february and in the month of march is going to be how much
or maybe you can have activity here to develop the hardware, then the software components have to be developed, the user manual has to be developed, and the training program has to be carried out
so, then we will start selling in the market, first we will exhaust these 10,000 units, we will sell these 10,000 units in the market, and then we start selling from the current period of the 16,000 units
so, capacitor is connected at node 5 this is the node right so, this is branch 1 branch 2 branch 3 so, current to the branch say it is i d 1 plus j i q 1 say real component of the current and imaginary component of current
but as we saw, the same things that make it attractive to learn, the lack of declarations also limit itõs expressiveness
sometimes supply is a problem, we thought that normal supply is maintained in the market but because of rainy season because of the supply chain problem the castic soda is not available in the market
so i can write in the absence of any movement again w f is integral i d lambda, w f dash will be lambda d i integral right, but we are not talking about any movement so far, fine
when you will put the value of i2 is equal to 1 by 2 you will get v2 is nothing but 4 s plus 1 upon 4 s
so, we are not measuring the input voltage always you know the switch is not always closed
95 and suppose your v sh supposed due to your shnt capacitor supposed voltage has improved 2
so if three phase alternators can have cylindrical rotor structure or salient rotor structure
now the requirements on spacing, the maximum spacing of the horizontal and vertical reinforcement that we must check has to be the lesser of these three values
at least the signal nets, which are critical, which determine the clock frequency, and each chip or board usually has a limit to the number of interconnecting terminates that you can have
how much is the cash balance
including both words and graphics helps learners engage with the content make connections with the different representations as well as integrate it with their prior knowledge
so, i cannot actually use this equation right now
this is the one variance as a dissection of leb the one, the first variance was labor idle time variance and then we will calculate the other two variances that is lmb and then the labor yield variance
so, those, these, several of these photographs actually come from the drawings that have been prepared and the photographs that have been prepared about the campus itself, campus design and execution itself, particularly highlighting confined masonry
this is n right and is equal to square root of area of i square curve by length of base over a half cycle everything i have written
so these are interesting demonstration of insight learning as to how in a normal type a situation we use our cognitive map, we use our past experience to think of the possible solutions that would help resolve the problem
the problem is that it is too fast at that particular time
r thevenin is simply right you you just you just short this is voltage source
and as before run it for 200 time units
so, the 1970 act for the first time, it removed product protection for medicines
so, what else is there in this equation to solve in the method of moments, what will happen
it may be for toys, it may be for camera, it may not be for the continuous running
1, 2, 3 or many times, only once because, the summation never reaches, the m summation never reaches e n
i should be equal to l i and therefore this gives me l equals mu zero over two pi log of b over a
unless i repeatedly excite the field in two opposite directions which i will not do in a dc machine normally
by referring the given value, determines the operating frequency and maximum expectableed value of resistance are for the oscillations to start
note one thing that series resonators are the ones that are preferred because as i said shunt resonators have to be connected in series
now, is the time to use it now this is where the visibility makes its case very very clear about how to use it
this is a lowpass prototype where the pie oré in this case we have pie equivalent
eigenvectors are used to make the linear transformation understandable that means the eigenvectors if you stretch and compress the vector on xy plane than the direction of the vector in xy plane is not going to change
we have seen that minimum when we go back over here minimum l 1 meant sparse
another question is how you really develop these kind of structures
let me go back to that rapper diagram here
later, you again turn on the heater, again heater will take some time for the coil to become hot
ok, this is what we refer to as the upstream gates
first of all, it has given funding to enable us find out lot of these mechanisms
before we continue any further, let us see what is not e learning
it is called a hankel function
so, to actually give the flux value directly, rather than that i can say normally d phi by dt is voltage, this we know, n times d phi by dt, maybe let me write that like that
the area across which it is going is the y z plane
in principle, there are four methods available focus directrix method, second one is concentric circle method, third one is oblong method, and fourth one is arc of circle method
we call it as infinite bus because the voltage and the frequency of this grid are kind of set and stoned
we saw the arches and even tall structures are possible because of this good compressive strength of the material itself
the wall is limited by the tension reinforcement, the fs that you have used as the permissible tensile stress in the steel and you can complete your analysis and the final value of a is estimated and you can use that in your calculations and it should work out to be the one that you are seeing on the screen and n is the modular ratio that you have been using in your previous calculations as well
then we also talked about one more which is actually a permanent magnet machine or permanent magnet rotor
if i just look at them you know superficially so i may have definitely some slots and so on and so forth where the windings are inserted but by and large if i look at the air gap the air gap is completely uniform throughout the circumference
so if we do that, we have to draw the incremental equivalent of this
if you can see that i have shown two standard cell placements, this is so called bad placement and this is so called good placements
but with this s, when we saw that e is zero for an electric field, that means any path i go around, work done is going to be zero in taking the charge around
it will come from some other source like initially applied and now is continuing
so, we do have let us say we are going to talk mainly about doubly excited machine in this course mostly that is the reason why i took an example with two excitations from stator site as well as rotor site and under a static condition i should be able to say id lambda that is what we call as the field energy
i have the source rotation facility which is which we can use using programming
so, first thing that gets called is the first name string then the second name string and then the construction of the name object
so, let us see under what conditions does that happen
now, normally you would expect the disclosure to be made, in what is called an invention disclosure form or idf for short
so, it is system is constant
now we could actually look at the value of x and rightly enough the value of x will be zero
initially i have written for you
so, and as a matter of fact when i floated this course there are people has been that that is a practical training how really want to you know put a cross a course which is mostly a practical training people have cell culture labs
again in absence of market price we don't know but this is an important ratio which links market prices to book value
and once the plan is over, the project starts off and then we have the project execution where the project manager concentrates on how the project progresses as per the plan
it can also check your breath; you can exhale on top of it
so, what am i doing
so, in this case ; so, in this case your k dash is equal to v 1 upon v 2 is equal to n 1 upon n 2 that is greater than 1
now, if there is a timing violation, then we have to go for physical synthesis, restructuring, where we modify the netlist so that the actual arrival time can be reduced, so that this slack value can be again made zero or positive
so, admittance are added for parallel branches, for branches in series impedance are added and for branches in parallel right admittance are added right
they were trying to model behavioural patterns to obtain excellence
this is the probe that we connect to the oscilloscope
so what we can observe, we can observe that inductors which are connected in parallel are combined in the same manner as the resistors in parallel
i have a charge what is the field around it q by 4 by epsilon r square those kind of things
very easily you can slot people into different categories and then you know who would be better if centered this very position in this capacity in the organization
this is going to be t cosine of theta one and this component, t sin of theta one, and therefore the net vertical force is t sin theta to minus t sin theta one, and the amplitude of very small i can roughly writ it as t theta two minus t theta one and the horizontally component, this t minus t, which is zero
there is a set of global convention there are set of local convention then a 1 to 1 mapping over here
so, when the light is switched off, the concentration of the minority carriers essentially decrease
you can see now, still it is still not allowing to pass
how will decompose
yeah, because there is only e z it also there
so that’s a conflict to be addressed which is what our next would be
so, therefore if you write this particular quantity d square si by d phi square with some value m square si is equal to 0 because we know that this kind of equation this is a positive value because it's 2 i e by h bar square and the particle having any kinetic energy in a circular motion obviously has a positive energy moment of inertia i is positive h bar square h bar is positive therefore this is a positive quantity and this of course has a solution si is equal to a e to the i m f plus b e to the minus i m f
so, proportionately now if we go for the expenses, so you can say the sales variance is positive but the expense variances will become negative because the raw material requirement for the 7 lakh worth of the sales was less it has gone up at the level of the 8 lakh rupees or dollars worth of sales so the variance will be negative but ultimately we are not going to achieve any objective it is the only wastage of the resources time and money so major limitation of the static budget and on the basis of that means whatever the information is available with us, we prepare the performance report and performance report basically is a generic term that usually means a comparison of the actual results with some budgets
so you have a two stage opamp circuit
when the circuit when the switched is off at time t is equal to 0 the current that is i naught just before the switch off of the circuit or just after the switch off phenomena in the circuit
now suppose you all have seen maybe in your lab ammeters which has multiple range which has say multiplied terminals and depending on the range of current that you want to measure you connect the wires all across the suitable terminals or it may have some knob with which you can change the range of measurement, how is that done
the horizontal line p3 on generate at 3; so this is the line where it is going to intersect extend it so that we are going to make another point p3
there is no way that the language does not give you any mechanism, any operator to do anything with the reference
so, you just get the values you do not get that positions
so, in star delta starting, normally we assume that the motor stator winding is connected in delta, so this is the motor winding okay
just compare these two bits and that result can be sent to the output directly without involving this n minus one bit comparator
so, if we ask for the value of y at this point it is 5 as we expect
so, if we try to quickly look at the output then for this code, the output will look like this
now, in the loop phase, what we are doing
now if you calculate the weighted sum of this signal probabilities and the sum of the bit changes across transitions, like you see, two, between one, one and zero, zero, two bits change and what is the total probability
on the other hand, in this circuit which was originally an inverting amplifier when we change the plus minus sign; this behaves like a non inverting schmitt trigger which means output also increases, if input increases
but how are we really going to quantify it
now, similarly i would like to draw something like a line
bisect it ok, but then it is still not unit you are saying break up the triangles into 2 right angled triangles and do the integration of each other,, but remember the your you then you also have to rotate your triangles because right now your co ordinate axis are what your triangles are not aligned with the co ordinate axis like the green triangle right this is your x and y
let us say you have a free electron or an electron in free space and you apply in electric field e, electric field usually goes from positive to negative
similarly, for v bn, and similarly for v cn right
now, current ratio, you know it is current assets divided by current liabilities
so i'll erase this small r, replace this by capital r, remove this small r, replace this by capital r, remove this small r and replace this by capital r, because we are doing it at radius capital r and i add the two, so the net flux is going to be: since d r is infinitesimal, i can write this exponential as: e raise to minus lambda r times e raise to minus lambda d r
ok, so to summarize, false path aware analysis is important and this is quite well under understood
there is an optics right, and then there is a cmos or a c, c, d, ah, charge coupled device based ah sensor which is capturing the image and then you have essentially ah image data
so, even though i have written just r, it is understood that when you see r it is actually r with vector on top, but it makes the whole thing very clumsy
also it is important to acknowledge this diversity when we say that we are designing using a learner centred approach
so, this is the ammeter is connected 1 wattmeter is connected and 1 voltmeter is here
so, today so now we will look at the final aspect of the 2d fem edge based fem, where we will look at some of the numerical aspects that go into calculating the matrix elements
then i chose a point minus j 1
the second point to note is that a value can be a single item
so i am getting a measure of flux, i am not saying it is exactly flux per unit area, flux per whatever unit turn, i am not saying that at all
so, it means we have to see here that how the prices are being changed
so, that is one mistake that you could do if you did not do this integral carefully ok
we are not looking at a situation where the confined masonry construction is an alternative to that type of reinforced masonry but minimally reinforced masonry with reinforced concrete bands and vertical bars and rc frame construction as well
so we are talking about something like the ten raise, fifteen, ten raise, ten, ten raise to fourteen
in a real problem, you would actually have to then also take into account what the actual stiffness is to arrive at the relative stiffnesses also
so, this is dl in this case
that means, we will heat this wafer on hot at 1200c for 1 minute
one easy way to do it is you have a mass voltage controlled current source and follow that with a mos current controlled voltage source
to see that, let us just make this transparent
similarly, if we by making this equal division, that means, we will be in a position to really draw such kind of normals for this major axis circle
so, for example, the curl of h right; so, let us expand it out
it will be upper bounded by one plus epsilon
now the positions determine the names so they do not have to be used in the same order
91 degree, right
so this memory location we can assume is non volatile and what we could actually do is that when the power is restarted the first thing the counter would so is to restart from the stored value this way potentially the attacker could cost the counter to count 2 value which is greater than the epoch time
so, this one look at this one this is a simple circuit element say something it is say it is something
and the first thing again i will do is first i will check whether this led is working fine or not
the other drawing components are compasses and dividers; the standard geometrical box consist of this compass through which one can draw circle by keeping this object at the middle and keeping a pencil through that slot, one can draw a perfect circle or an arc
ok, so you can have a tradeoff like this
all of them are rotating none of them are stationary
so, with the help of state diagram, state equation and output equation we know we have discussed in the previous lectures
this is the system which works as shear walls in the direction parallel to the lateral forces and in the direction perpendicular to the lateral forces acts as an out of plain wall
so now if you see there are two figures given in the slide, in the first figure the variation of the signal is with respect to omega t
so, this is something which you have to keep in mind because here the unit is step function is u minus t it means that the value of unit step function is like this were you have a value at time t is equal to, less than t is equal to 0 but it is 0, when t greater than 0
this is your source, this is your target, and you have to find out a path from the source to the target
during the second run the advap123 is present at another location and in the third run, third location and so on
if the solenoid is very thin right suppose this is this solenoid or the torrid is very thin, it becomes like a flux carrying ring
now, if you draw the phasor diagram, then v a n is the reference one, so we call this is the phase sequence is a b c
that is why preference dividend coverage ratio
so you also will get the payment from kolkata if it is acceptable to you
so, more precisely means it is known
now if you use a current buffer, this is a current buffer, it will have a very low input resistance, meaning all of that current will go into the input and the output current will be exactly equal to the input
so, first you will digest k functions and then start executing 1, 2, 3, 4 up to statement n
it will get attracted towards the gate because gate is positive with respect to substrate right with respect to substrate gate is positive voltage
and based on mathematics technology has been done
just see the theory for auto transformer whatever had been done right
the number of shareholders are given
they are at very different levels of demand
so lets take an example of thirty two bits, l, f, s, r, if n is thirty two, so so
so, this is the most basic way of biasing a transistor and this is known as drain feedback
although we see some difference but we are not seeing like zero net shrinkage, right
function 2 would have needed two parameters
we will start off with first generator operation having seen the different configurations, we will look at the implications of these connections as and when we discuss the characteristics
so, it is there it is then evident that high slip operation of induction motor would be highly inefficient and if you operate at a very high slip
now, so we know that the primary function of a university involves teaching and research of which research has the potential to create new knowledge and new knowledge intern can create new products and new services, so because research has this potential of creating new knowledge
the reinforced concrete frame construction has framing action
p is 20
there is another instruction that is very much useful for digital signal processing applications, this is called multiply and accumulate
but here the limitation of this problem was that we were not given about the details of the different type of the workers
the left brain pulls the muscles downwards and the right side of the brain raises the left hand side eyebrows as well as the lips and cheeks and therefore, this smile expresses mixed emotions
57 an angle minus 62 plus 120, so it will be 58 degree ampere right
now look at your screen, you see two kids and then the obvious thing that you basically look at is the resemblance between the faces of these two children
denominators will cancel out and the numerator, what you get is s square plus 12 is equal to a into s plus 2 into s plus 3 plus b into s into s plus 3 plus c into s into s plus 2
there what happens when i have a very short lived signaling time, what is the frequency content
so, regardless of whether you are a student looking to become an instructional designer or design some e learning or whether you are a teacher who is trying to design e learning for your students or whether you are a professional id in an e learning company, when you create e learning you will be an instructional designer
if a person has the heel of one foot on the ground with the toes pointed to the sky; he or she is happy or admiring themselves; this usually happens in a mirror
now we will see few techniques or technologies that are used to fabricate integrated circuits
standard technique gather all the unknowns on one side move as many knowns as possible to the right hand side right
however, later on he revised his previous research and suggested that there are seven common universal facial expressions
we have another kind of closed curve also
now, if you look at the revenue, you will realize that first three years it was constant, but in last two years there is a fall
so, in this case the area which was exposed the photoresist got etched; which means, that if i have this as a mask and i have a square wafer which is coated with the photoresist; now, if i use positive photoresist and a bright field mask then the result obtained will be the pattern on the mask
all of them are going to work normally at much higher frequency so that they are miniaturized, and space is at a premium in aircraft and all, so you want to reduce the size as much as possible when you are going to aerospace electronics systems
a convention application is the second type of application and the provisions are given under the indian patents act
so, for voltage drop we are writing as positive and voltage rise we are writing as negative
we now know what a nonlinear 2 port must look like, that is what its characteristics must be in order to have a high gain
so, any point you are trying to read the content of a port; first you wrote 1 to the port
so it is actually this scan mode, shift divide equal to one means
so, if we say s is hello as before, then for a slice we give this starting point and the ending point separated by colon
delay due to partitioning this i have just now mentioned the critical path delays: this has to be minimized
we say we start at the 0th position; and so long as we have not reach the end of the list in terms of positions, we set n to be the value at position i then we execute this statement and we increment position
so that means that what we have discussed in the circuit like this where we have the resistances and we try to find out the current flowing through the network
that means whatever is the shortest path tree of the original path, the radius of this b, r, b, c tree that you are getting
so any class that contains virtual member function either by definition or by inheritance, you may have defined a virtual member function yourself or you may have inherited it from your parent, but if you have at least one virtual member function, then that class is said to be a polymorphic type
so, how much is the actual cost of the fuel at the 70
so, if you look and look at this point, it is your what you call pi by 2 right
second advantage is there is no loading problem because of high input resistance and lower output resistance of op amp
and when there is a current flowing depending on the input voltage signal there will be some current flowing in the coil
so this diagram actually tells you that
so, that poor person who is finally, taking this will get something to very you know unpleasant to look at
so, you follow different method to solve such linear equations, right for computational efficiency
again this is it is a simple property of electrical engineers we do not like pain so we want to make math easier right
when it is done in the vertical plane the front view, we can draw that length locate a', b', c', d'
you have seen function which have void return type which say that i am not returning anything, but in constructor that is not the case
so here is shailendra kumar
you chose you took your problem discretized it chose a set of basis functions
now, sharon watkins, she became very famous as a whistleblower
for now, you just have to note that there are possibilities of doing a placement new
we will of course cover devices in more detail
and then we came heavily on the assessment part, how personality is assessed
so the remaining two months cash budget, february and march, these two months months cash budget i will prepare in the next class
we have a nonlinear 2 port
now what happens is that when i multiply d times c then i get something which is 100 into 1 into 100
this is a stationary flux, which is not rotating basically, so it is stationary flux
you could have found out this profit in one go also that my total sales are 6 lakhs, my total cost is 4 lakhs and my profit is 2 lakhs
this is another important equation and 1 more important equations which we normally talk about is this and this is another equation corresponding to maximum torque
hello and welcome to this video lecture in the course for secure systems engineering, in the previous video lecture we had actually looked at technique known as fanci which could be used to detect potential areas in an ip core where a trojan maybe present
it will draw a unity power factor current
probably, i have not solve it for you
so, this is what we are focusing on
lets say these two wires which i have shown, a and b
the blue are the metal, the red are the poly silicon which forms the gates, and the greens and the dotted regions are the so called diffusion regions
so, that does not mean that when we say infinite gain; that means, that we have infinite output voltage, alright
so, in the last class remember i introduced the peripheral neurons and i allowed them to grow
in this context in module 26, we discussed about casting particularly on a hierarchy up cast and down cast issues
so, basically the two port network has two terminal pairs and acting as access points like we discussed in this particular figure
so if you want to know the results including the small signal output conductance all you have to do is to consider the parallel combination of rds and rl instead of the load resistance rl alone
and at the same time is rather culture and wants to come across as an intellectual person, in general wants to indicate that the person is in offensive
and this k is a property of this dac, ok it is a constant, ok
the level of axial stress due to compression divided by the strength of masonry or in this case the permissible stress and compression
so, this is 15 volt, this is 5 volt, and let us take all this resistances is equal to 1 kilo ohm 1 kilo ohm r 2 equals 1 kilo ohm for ease of calculation
yeah, that is why you notice that they sometimes it is small x, sometimes it is capital x right
, we will come to that when we start looking at detailing for earthquake resistance
but we will have to make sure there also that no fixed cost is going to increase and it is going to remain the same irrespective of the any level of the production
and after that you have to give a time of t setup and t hold says that not only that, the minimum time of this delta, because within that same clock cycle this register two times
so for this generally we use something called synchro scope in the power station which actually would check automatically everything and then connect it, okay
so, what is triangle 1
consequently, we find that people rely more on kinesic cues than any other code to understand meanings of nonverbal messages
in order to do this, we modify the simple p n junction by introducing a hetero structure and we will see that we actually introduced 2 hetero structures in order to form a double hetero structure device
if any of these is 1, then it is under attack if all of these are 0 then is not under attack right
we had called this r1 there, now we call it rs
we can achieve that with galvanic anodes which are self regulatory
in this way we can proceed
so, it becomes necessary operating in present conditions that any new knowledge that is created is protected by intellectual property rights, so that they could be parties in the industry who are interested in working with the university and taking it further
to help learners effectively assimilate content, construct their own understanding; make their own meaning, learners need to engage in articulation and reflection
but anyway i think there are two things that we have to do
now, the principle characteristic of band pass filter or any filter for that matter is its ability to pass frequencies relatively, un attenuated relatively, un attenuated over a specific band or spread of frequency called pass band and attenuate the other band of frequency called stop band, we have seen this
for example, if we are taking any gear mechanisms like watch to have the synchronization motion, we have a spring
so, in tm polarization e is force to be e z and h is in xy plane
in today's class, we will learn about how to construct a hyperbola
here, data is coming from outside application boundary in external input
whenever we see that for example, in the first screen we have a blue button for back and in the second screen we have a green button for black, it just breaks the consistency of the learner and they are confused about even the shape had changed because from circle it has become a square, the position has changed from the bottom left to top right
it may be noted that the power dissipated into r 2 dash into 1 upon s minus 1 includes the core loss that is figure 8 b
introduction of internet introduced a new era in the electronic commerce
but if tomorrow someone else invents a device which is different, you should still be able to work with them
these devices that we are considering they are most of the time they are mechanical device or electro mechanical devices and many a times they involve human being like; say, there is a keyboard if i connect keyboard to the microprocessor then when the user is pressing a key may be the interrupt is given in the processer that the key that a key has been pressed
so, this is due to the mutual inductance that is coming up between the stator and the rotor and the interaction between the stator and rotor currents
so perhaps the foremost technique for following the hydration reaction is isothermal calorimetry
so, we recollect that, in the linux systems the randomize va space would take 3 values 0, 1 or 2
so the first task, what we have to do is that we have to convert this particular circuit into frequency domain
now whenever there is a malloc that gets requested what happens first is that the ptmalloc code would pass through this particular link list and determining whether there is a free chunk of memory that it can satisfy the request for malloc
i am there to help you out
what we need is a tree is a spanning tree
i will later explain what all these constants are
one case i have discussed finished in the previous class
so, brute force is a bad idea
now, in this case it is one, two, three, four, five lines are cutting, so cut size is five
and then phi minus phi i is equal to whole bunch of terms over here
now, these four can be mutually conflicting; if you pull one, the others will be pulled in the reverse direction, means if you want to improve one maybe the others might get degraded
so it is like this
we bias this in such a way, n is connected to negative and p is connected to positive
but when the actual and the standard time is different and if the standard is revised also, you are using the third and the fourth formula
so if we were to work on the concept of homogenization, and that assumption of an isotropic homogeneous material is, if it were completely acceptable for a material like motored masonry, then you could simply work with principal stresses and when the principal stresses reach some of the material strengths, you have a failure criteria
so, springs now wants to stop this coil but, due to inertia the coil will go up to some distance
it may have typically garbage values
because we are not giving equal importance to the x and y, both the directions
so in the last lecture we talked about the design for distribute technique
so, s is equal to line colon minus 1, will take the line and the strip of the last character which is typically backslash n that we get, when we do readlines
so, in step 1 i made r belong to v 2 in step 2 i make r belong to v 1 because that is my region of interest
this is why we essentially call a p n junction to be a rectifier because it conducts very well during forward bias and the reverse biased current is very small
so, generation company generates the power and that gives to the central grid or the marketing company who is known as the transmission company
right, how to solve it
so, different type of your what you call lightning arrester so, that were that is beyond the scope for this course
i would suggest that one should focus automatically more on the person who has asked the question, but while they are answering they should also maintain an equal eye contact with the rest of the team members also
so, one of the simplifying assumptions will be we’ll take our current source to be let us say along the z axis, but very thin will make the wire to be very thin ok
this whole thing, this part of it comes from the format
so i have different methods
so that is basic difficulty of what we are saying as issue one
so, instead of writing it as in terms of current, i can also write this position as 1 volt
so, we will put z bar a complex number is equal to you can write either v m by i m this one or is equal to you can write v m by root 2 divided by i m by root 2
because if you tell pa ask parents that ok, how were you at 14, they it is a blank
volume
so, that it is customary to refer to this voltage as the back emf
2 this is i 1 into the power factor 0
what is what are the number of nearest neighbors of each particles
so, therefore, i erase these unnecessary things and connect this directly to the ground, this is inverting amplifier
e is also related to the potential by the expression e dvdx, which means the potential v is ∫ e d x
so, m l then this is your mean side this is your load side c and v sometimes you write like this , but at the resistance in very high
here is way we would do it; we would create a new point whose x coordinate is self dot x plus p dot x
so, then maybe these resistance says this contact resistances which will come in picture in series with this resistance that will be different
then that its boundary
this is the what only one cost driver is there, we are multiplying this
well i just create in this in this green shaded region i introduce loss in the epsilon r mu r of those triangle
what i understand is that writing has to be writing in its purest form and then maybe digital and all that can come later, okay i hear you
and if you want to calculate, or if you want to understand what was the equation of the output voltage, right
in the telecom sector we have seen that earlier it was dot department of telecommunication
so, while it is easy to understand that n that is the number of stages in ring oscillator upends the frequency, the delay of each inverter that is t actually depends upon the fabrication process of these gates
whether the time we keep in our communication is monochrome or polychrome or whether during our dialogues and conversations we are using different aspects related with our understanding of time
3, similarly at 4, also intersect this point
so, it is ah 3 by 160; so, it is 160 by 3 hertz per megawatt right
so, this is called a dual slope voltmeter
now, second thing is, the steady state a long time, after the switch closes, means the capacitor acts like open circuit right
so, it is a more cumbersome, but we can take
until then thank you
so, vd by vgs equals minus gm times rd times rd times rl plus 1 over j omega c2 divided by the sum of everything r d plus rl plus 1 by j omega c2 okay now previously we had only rl in the numerator for vo be greater than the output voltage magnitude
so, unless i have some amount of access available the machine is not going to accelerate
so, we see there is one rc here there is one rc over here and there is a amplifier stage correct
then voltage across two om will be two i one
so, you build it into the solution, you do not have to do something extra to get this property yeah ok
now, as i said, this is one of the most widely used technique
suppose, you have a suppose you have a we have seen already i have made it for you before right, this is a star connected load right, this is a star connected load
this is the difference of how many
so, it will just 17
so, this is your capacitor
so whenever i am having a machine rated for say 1500 rpm means it will work as a motor with rated voltage, drawing rated current, delivering rated torque at rated speed
so, delta x by c is going to be a very small value right, but that is not exactly the right way to think of it
what is the need for moving the data member here, because earlier see if we just add an employee class and let us say we allow engineer to specialize for that and have the name here then certainly there will be no issue as you go to the manager and director and so on
now because i have this i should be able to say at the given torque if i want to get different values of speed i should be able to get different values of speed either by adjusting the voltage or by adjusting the armature resistance or by adjusting the flux value
this can be typically a delivery annotation and this is a message annotation
so the joint thicknesses are what alpha prime is standing for, the ratio of the joint thicknesses
so, after etching sio2, i will dip this wafer in acetone right acetone because acetone is pr steeper
so, cash budget tells us about the cash position of the firm and the balance sheet tells about the overall financial position of the firm
let us also write d s prime
can you see anything in that this one
now another way to obtain the line current is that you replace the delta connected source into its equivalent star connected or y connected source
so, what it says is that, when the once the resonance condition occurs, right the xxll will be equal to xxc
so just like charge density consisted of a small, small or the charge is distributed in space, polarization density consists of let me remove this black line so that they don't disturb us this consists of small point dipoles distributed in space very close together
so this schedule is ready
o, i or f
can you measure resistance, yes capacitance yes, right
now, in this example we have just shown that how to use vector with a fixed initial size max
but, you hold a reference to that
if it is ac i am going to have definitely an inductance drop also and there will be an induced emf e on the other side, that is the induced emf
so, 2 2 can go back again to the original thing and it also has a new thing here which is 1 0
surely it can work for india as well
now so, this side is infinite resistance, this side is 0 resistance and all the other values will be from here to here
so, either gamma l values inside the circle will be unconditionally stable will lead to unconditional stability or they will lead to potentially instable situations
now the material vapors travels out to crucible and coat on the substrate and coat the substrate
you can just simply include a rheostat
so, we just wanted to emphasise that boolean values can be computed, assigned, passed around just like numerical values are
with that, 40 kilo ohm are in series; that means, this 40 plus this 6 into 60 divided by your 6 plus 60; this is the total your what you call this is that your total value of the resistance, right
the length say that again
so there are many other interesting things you can do with strings for example, you can manipulate upper case and lower case
all right now, if e is very, very strong near the edges and there is no, no other charge giving rise to this is laplace equation
now the pole voltage will give information on this diodere rating in terms of voltage and the rating of the transistor and also the voltage across the inductor to check for the volt second balance
sometimes we come across situations where people do not apply repair principles properly and end up producing more durability problems
so, we are deriving from 1
now, let us look at the right hand side, here if you just compare the method norm is still called public, but the data members are now set to be private
c one is a positive edge triggered, c two is a negative edge triggered
so, this term over here that you see right it is a longish term
the frame size 4 we again look at the deadline constraint that there must be a clear frame between the task arrival and the deadline and that is given by the expression, the worst case is given by the expression 2 into f minus gcdf comma p
in the last class we looked at the distribution factor, kxi divided by sigma kx i is the distribution factor in the x direction
i cannot vary the flux whereas here it is variable flux i will have variability in the flux, right
the reflection is very rare
on the other hand, if you go the other way then the sum at this point is 0 plus 0 is 0, and the sum over here is 7 plus 7 is 14
so, is point c stable yes
now we really know what is happening
so, because of these limitations this is not the ideal design
now, if you see this equivalent circuit like a single phase, so this is v an, this is i a and z y is equal to z delta by 3 right
so if i calculate this delay across all, s zero and s i pairs, s zero, s one s zero, s two, s zero, s three and so on, and take the maximum of them, that will give me the maximum skew, right
please understand that generally the cause is i and the effect is lambda, cause is i and effect is flux
there are cultural differences also
so, net based technique, as i had said, you have to do some kind of delay budgeting
we have to determine the thevenin impedance and thevenin voltage, first let us find out the value of thevenin impedance
within this repository where that can take their personalized notes on top of this or access the base content and start writing
and pin 8 is not connected
so, taylor’s theorem will tell us that you know f of say z naught plus delta z by 2 let us take this we all know this f of z naught is a first term next term is delta z by 2 f prime right and higher order terms
i am just showing you the solution directly
so, this is the series form and that was a closed form which form should we chose
so, that means, i mean here if you come again ah that your form factor is equal to rms value by average value and your peak factor is equal to maximum value point points your what you call is equal to maximum value by rms value
so, time constant tau is equal to c r, r thevenin, c r thevenin
so, it is basically w 0 by bw bandwidth
so, effect of ice that was sag is determined, but as soon as that ice will be there, naturally the weight of conductor will increase, because ice is also quite the, weight of ice also will be high
how is agility achieved
9 anfu by gamma m1 right now this is true for plate so for plate in earlier lectures we have seen that how to calculate the net area of the plate net area of the plate means about the critical section what will be the net area net effective area of the plate that we have seen how to calculate so this net area will be required to find out the rapture strength of the section so here this net area will be required now in threaded rods in case of threaded rod also this this will be same formula we can use that is tdn will be is equal to 0
so here it will be three point zero five
process
so, in this particular circuit principal node would be node 1, node 2 and node 3 while node 4 and node 5 are the simple nodes
this four, you distributed as one, one, one and one
so, this ah so we got this one your, ah what you call this r theve[nin] r thevenin is equal to directly, we are writing 20 into 20 upon 20 plus 20
this is what is called thin film integrated circuit
you do not have to remember it separately
so what i am trying to get at is your porosity and permeability need not be directly interlinked for all kinds of cementitious systems, but for the most part they are fairly closely interlinked, okay
i will explain more about this capacitance permian's relationship later on when we are discussing the magnetics so we have used this kind of the model here we have also put some kind of a saturation effect here if the value the permians if the value of the plots is greater than a particular value then we will not we will take the same value of c as is given here but if it is greater than the value a particular set value then it will start exponentially decaying down to zero so this will emulate the bh a core
so when we are going to use steel
if you have seen gas sensors, they are made using screen printing because, they are very easy to fabricate
so, this is just definition all right
similarly if you have now slipped of the pen it reflects now what you inwardly think about that every situation
the stationary part of a dc machine consists of main poles, designed to create the magnetic flux, commutating poles inter interposed between the main poles and your designed to your sparkles operation of the brushes at the commutator and a frame or yoke
would not like to have that, because we want to have a circuit that is running as fast as possible
before we go in to the details as i told you right in the beginning that we would be taking only three four different types of psychometric tools, i must tell you that there are large number of tools available for assessment of personality, i am talking about the psychometrics once
in this video we can look at interesting summarization of the significance of nod and shake of the head
so, it looks like we are measuring we have v2, we have r1, we have r2, and we are measuring the vplus correct
as in the previous experiment, the duty cycle is set to 0
so, the first is
is the delta function sitting at r minus r prime
so this is the basic idea behind the edf scheduler
you are seeing that what it is doing as if these blue color cells are forming a similar structure as a very similar kind of covering as you see here
this will of course be a taylor series of two variables and they are very useful by their own right but for us we don't need to go into too many details
here, as an example 4, we are looking at a circle
cmrr is common mode rejection ratio right
this amount will work out as 70,80075
7 l by r r is 1
one is a profit generated on cash basis, the other is cash generated from operations
this particular one, it was two structures very close to each other on what we call in england, a motorway
if this is the probability of f is zero, then one minus of this will be the probability f will be one
again consider the complex class and we know for example if i write in parallely in case of say a double type, then if i have a variable of type double then i can input from c in i can output to c out using these operators
so, this way this counting will go on
and then we have inside the bracket is the actual yield minus standard yield
so, * d ∅ /dt right, this minus sign comes because of the lenz’s law right
so, it is i 1 is equal to your i 3 plus i x this is at node 1, right
some of you will know or at least have heard of instructional design especially if you are experienced in e learning or you have been working in the e learning industry for a while
so what we are going to now turned this equations into is write them in terms of fiels
the hand to face gestures also suggests, whether a person is feeling bored in a given situation or is genuinely interested in the situation
now again just to put this in perspective just showing you the problem in reinforced concrete you have the surface concrete on top of the reinforcing bar, this concrete is the one which is facing the effects of drying, it is also facing the effects of ingress of aggressive agents like chlorides and carbon di oxide okay, whereas you have concrete in the interior which is relatively free from all these problems
if we are looking from this direction it looks like a rectangle
so, this is the problem set up
now, with that if we just try to trace this messages that we have put and in the next slide we will try to do that
is it that say when i accept that my clinician has told me that your state of affairs is because you are suffering from some kind of a chemical imbalance
everything is gold, from this particular part i want to fabricate electrodes like this
but there is some other techniques also which work at the structural level of the circuit and carry out some transmissions therein, so that some of the ah, delay related constraints, which are not otherwise getting satisfied, they can be satisfied, ok
60% because 40% is the gross profit
managing different kind of issues
so, whenever we talk about setting up a lab, as perceive of the cell culture which is you are dealing with biologically active material and material which should remain confined within a space
now, 3 phase system is more economical than the single phase system, why
inventions have their own reason
otherwise r1 and r2 dash, similarly x1 and x2 dash, it would be very difficult to segregate
in case if the professor allows you to use a smart phone, so is there any monitoring happening like this is what we have to check, you can check with them or you should’nt do
it can also be arranged as they appear before the observer in contrastive sets, but the terms of these polar pairs can differ by as many degrees is we want for our own analysis
ok, determining area is not difficult because you see your total silicon floor is rectangular in nature
57 right now considering value of kb as 0
how we will carry out the circuit analysis with the help of state variable methods
i just discussed with you that this is only for the one level of the production, one level of the activity and when actual is different that it has, means hardly any use
it begins at o goes in angular velocity direction radially out finally, it comes to a
so your modified circuit will look like as shown in the figure where the current source now will be in parallel with the inductance
you can see it is as per the order of permanence
we are using it for signature generation, so for detecting whether the faults are taking place or not
the way fanci actually differs from the other regular testing mechanisms is that fanci focuses on this particular area which normal or regular testing mechanisms would not actually cater to
so, we will do a separate experiment where we will understand common mode rejection ratio
so, odd union prime will be those elements which are either in odd or in prime
ok, so next one, that, after giving all these explanation, you that equation thirty eight and thirty nine, we will just split it
the hardware expert need not know software very well and software experts need only know very little about the hardware
now we want to do time, the philosophy is, we want to do a time update before the wave travels to next due to the nearest point ok
so, we have those lines visible there, this entire semi circular portion projected onto the bottom plane
5 kb dt into fub by gamma mb and if i put those value i can find out bearing strength as 72
similarly, at the output side what we can write
the budgeted price we expected was higher, actual price we paid was less
so, basically we arranged the coils in such a way that it completes 1 set of arrangement for 1 particular phase
and then you can personalize on top of it and not, if you, you can probably have one option of not sharing it also
not harmonic modulation, intermodulation
so, if it my output voltage is out of phase, and my feedback network should provide a 180 phase shift; if my output is in phase with the input my feedback network does not require to provide any phase shift
we know see i dss is constant and v p is constant, we know
in other words, we talk about software updates and, ah, ah, adjusting the duty cycle
lets say we have a gate
now, how do we trace out the actual solution when the solution grows, whenever we increment the number
inventry, it's a shipping company, not very large inventory they need
another important torque which we also have mentioned is the torque due to this spring, which you call the controlling torque
so using that you can actually control the impact of the area, the length of the net and the slack
what about that plus sign that directions is not seeking theme get because seen three we have used to job
if we could only count how many paths go from (0, 0) to (2, 4) and then how many paths go from (2, 4) to (5, 10), these are all the bad paths
so, the bottom line prescription is if you are using return by reference, never return a local variable
now when i add the object now let us add the object in this case it is v 2 so, what happens now
so you are actually pumping something plastic into this cavity
the disadvantage is of course you cannot turn the current on and off whenever you want as you can do with an impressed current cathode protection and it has got a finite life
so, if suppose with that; without any caution for example, i mean just giving an example any human being say if you take a conducting rod and if you try to touch the line that person will die actually
we would like to construct a generator at this point
this is equation 38, this equation can be written like this; that r t is equal to 0 or t less than equal to 0 and is equal to t for t greater than or equal to 0
so, the output voltage is same no matter what is the load value it can be also a voltage follower it can be also a buffer and also a buffer
to begin with, we assume that profit is very close to cash from operations only those items which require adjustment suppose there are 40 items in p and l all of them won't need adjustment few of them which are of two types they would need adjustments only those two types of items will either add or reduce
and as i told you, there are two versions
now how might we retain this labour cost and yet have my high revenue, yet bring the customer more often in this case
and will be putting in the phasor form or quantity this will be rms value right, that is that is that is your that is this note written here that is the note is written here
so, anyway so; that means, then this happens because of your return stroke because it makes the electrical short circuit
void is where you would need to use a type, you can use the type void, but it actually says that there is no type
english parts are dimensioned in mm with decimals, not fractions
now, transmitted value
there is very important ratio called as debt equity ratio which we will be calculating soon
second part digital integrated circuits
so you can parallely do one more thing
in open circuit test it was a parallel equivalent circuit, so we were trying to look at the currents being divided, here the voltage is getting divided between r and x, right
so, plot of i t is shown in this figure
now you will observe one thing that the earlier balance of capital of 2 lakhs which was as on 1st january will be continued in the balance sheet of 2nd january this happens because balance sheet is a cumulative statement it is not a statement of any one transaction
complement means if it is a v, you make it h, if it h, you make it v
but short circuit test in the laboratory performed on the high voltage side
so, either in the first quadrant or in the fourth quadrant, but here it should not be there, because r is always positive
non isometric lines include inclined and oblique lines and cannot be measured directly; instead they must be created by locating two endpoints
and, how it works or what it does, it gives a output which is proportional to the difference of the 2 inputs
0, 3
so, now i had to go on to the blocked rotor test to look at the series parameters of the induction motor
so, it has only one divisor other than 1 and 25, which is 5
so, r tends to 0 so, v is equal to 0, but i is not 0 for short circuit it will be fault actually, it will carry huge amount of current and if short circuit happens your are electrical devices or elements will be damaged also, right
this you can see how you write the specialization
that means proportionality, right, that means up to this, it is linear and it obeys the hooks law
copy, paste and enter
you look at the total delays along the paths and see whether the critical paths are violating some clock timing constraints or not and you try to place the blocks in such a manner that the path lengths, particularly the critical paths
now, let us see another point another point that is we have to understand the effect of input offset voltage on the amplifier operation, we will see now effect of input offset voltage on the amplifier operation
so, here is the portland cement concrete and twenty eight days compressive strength, right
exactly similar equations are now going to be obtained for ah electromagnetic waves
so, this will actually take the value of a take the value of b call the function and after that increment a, and b individually and that will certainly give the correct results
what do they look like
now, this has generated an income in excess of 700 million pounds from royalties, share sales and licensing intellectual property
so, the answer i mean we can do this integration, but it's not very interesting right the answer is independent of r
so, now angle the current sorry the impedance z y is equal to z theta say
so, from the e plane tee, basically what we got was s 41 is equal to s 31 which is equal to 1 upon square root of 2, so this is from the e plane tee
now, to assemble each of these items into one another, we need to know different kinds of assembly that that are available in the solidworks
it is also said that when two people were equally dominant or who want to dominate the given situation try to shake hands a symbolic struggle takes place or a particular individual may offer the hand like this and while you are offering your hand like this with a palm of position you may also try to tilt it back
so if you can understand the topological information, it is very easy for you to analyze the circuit
if you take the interest expense, how much is an trust expense here
it is more like on drawing sheets earlier we have try to draw smooth freehand curves
so, such kind of pin is there; the first and second part
so this is the new part here
that mask you will use as a next step ok
you could ask your opinion about someone and they might show disgust
that means this part is equal to s into p m divided by 1 minus s right
that means, it shows suppose you have, suppose you have this is the diagram this is voltage this across this v f this is actually internal impedance z s and it is small v f given, but across this the voltage is v f and this characteristic impedance is z c right
how will this guy look
the direct lightning stroke may be happen in the middle of the line, may be on the top of the tower or may be on the ground wire or shield wire; here it is or on a line conductor
this is not voltage, this is sorry this is current, right
now these are your personality characteristics and these are the characteristic which also helps you exploit your talent to the maximum possible extent to achieve the best in the field of sports
so, i am just taking that both of them are in phase
so, overall, whoever are the owners, it is their capital
so lets look at one of the time
the cost of material consumed has also gone up from 21 to 25
so, at the end of this particular iteration that is the time period and recollect that the time period is set to 2 ^ 24, we use these frequency distribution tables to identify whether a cache hit or cache miss is observed
when you look at this equation over here what is the difficult part about it is the delta function right, it is going to act in the way that will present some difficulty
so, now, after that you have seen the development of circuit model, actually things are not difficult just a little bit of you know our understanding is required little bit and that is all
so, as takeaways from this principle or segmenting, segmenting principle, always try to avoid complexity by breaking your lessons into smaller pieces that are manageable by your students and that can be able to know your students to be able to learn better
once it is done you will have that rectangle on the plane
we will use these concepts of density of state and fermi function, in order to calculate the electron whole concentration in semiconductors and first we will start with intrinsic semiconductors
the reason we cannot independently solve it is this green triangle has edges belonging to the set 1 and set 2
so, let us go back here
so, leading to adventment or advancement of the technology which is integrated technology, we could have this particular ic ok
if those are electrically connected or sorted together then it will happened ok
i created, then again an horizontal partition like this, a horizontal partition like this
learning disabilities and autism
so associated magnetic field is really very, very small
so, if you have seen the last module, its configuration is opposite to an integrator
hi, welcome to this particular module and this is a lecture series where that we are looking at oscillator’s right
or continuous evaluation system, you can bring this into the continuous evaluation system, so the best contributor are based on what how much you are contributing to this because you are essentially ensuring that everyone in class is learning out of this content
ok, so how were simulating many faults together by having m z m o in all the lines
now, you apply kcl at this thing, then this current actually entering this i 3, right and this 3 i current also coming here this 2 are entering plus 3 i is equal to your what you call i 2, right
now frequency is given as fc here
013 meter and v 0 is this one
but what to do with this
let us call it k i dot r ok, and e naught in this case is going to be a vector in the x y plane right because its e x e y right
if i want to use the data, then i need to write it in this form
this is sim900 module, i will have already discussed in detail regarding this module
the third case formula will be applied here that is a total weight of actual mix divided by the total weight of standard mix into standard cost of standard mix minus standard cost of the actual mix
so, based on our steps, we can sense that this line we have to pick for constructing any auxiliary planes and views because that is the true line what we can get
so, i called it one variable x instead of having to write something minus 1 and so x right so, right
before you prepare the real profit and loss account at the end of the time horizon, these days we don't prepare only monthly financial statements, sorry, annual financial statements
and then we will shift by t and finally for different value for t we will now multiply the two functions and then integrate to determine the area of overlapping reasons
this works in you know sort of reasonably small size problems the matlab syntax is very simple a slash b right that is what we achieve a solution
lots of users we detailed out
so, when vgs is increased below greater than particular voltage my current i d is sufficient to for when my vgs is greater than particular voltage, th what will happen
so, r thevenin is equal to basically your v thevenin by i sc, you will get the your what you call that norton resistance same philosophy right
so, company has to seek a balance between fair amount of equity and debt
first thing we have to project this point onto vertical plane the vertical plane is this one, let us call this one this is horizontal plane
we have a set of points these are the clock terminals we try to find out our matching, for which the sum of the total, some of the edges, is minimum
first looking at the emissions the carbon dioxide emissions we find that for 1 kilogram of concrete there is an emission of about 0
so, if it is so then suppose a circuit is given where we have got v thevenin and r thevenin right and a load resistance is connected, this symbol is a variable symbol right, then i l is equal to i l is equal to your v thevenin by r thevenin plus r l right
of course, do not try this with c style casting, because it will become very dangerous
so now if there is some key or limiting factor, you have to use that limiting factor or key factor in a way that production of those products will be maximum by using that power for 18 hours whose pv ratio is the comparatively higher as compared to the other ones
so, g s into u into x is a kind of a prediction of what the scattered field should be if you give me u and x
what we will see in the next lecture is that we can actually come up with a dramatically different way to compute gcd, which will be much more efficient
r zero to a, which gives me b
that is to say you put your powder into the sample holder and then you smooth it off, the problem is that this really tends to produce preferential orientation
v is equal to v 1 plus v 2 plus v k plus v n right this is your what you call that voltage v this is the supply voltage v right
then class 2 we have seen the substrates
so for example this was run on an intel i7 machine which had an l1 cache with 64 cache sets, so each column over here corresponds to a particular cache set
jit is basically a material management technique which is the firms use to reduce the cost of inventory or the cost of storage of inventory as well as overall cost of inventory
there are of course, advantages to using segmenting your lessons
so earlier the gate delays were much larger so you could afford to ignore the interconnection delay, but you cannot right
001; then what will happen
now beyond 30 ghz, the wavelength is in millimetre
so, these operating systems are tightly coupled to the corresponding rich operating systems so that a priority of a task in the rich os can get mapped to a corresponding priority in the secure os
now what we’ll have is, new notetaking page, this would be the existing notes that admin has already put up into the system
so all the surface of the conductor are equipotential surfaces
there could be multiple and varied reasons for why she was unable to answer her friends questions
ok, these are all architectural, or algorithmic level, you can say, or higher level design techniques
you may have come up with various approaches such as short videos and practice questions, active discussion forums, frequent interactions with instructors, immediate feedback and additional learning resources
for example, supposing we try to create a list and by mistake we use a semicolon instead of a comma
so, that's why they are ignoring this
having understood perception to a greater extent, we are now moving to our second concept that we would we trying to discuss at length and that is learning
one of the most common things we do when we use the internet is to type queries and look for matching documents or other resources on the internet
this has exactly the opposite
calculate the current, conductance and power absorb by the resistor
and in the frequency domain, i told you earlier d by d t, you replace by j omega right if you do
so it will be located in that place
here what you saying is that with every line we associate two vectors: m z and m o
the first stage is called condition assessment
and, on this side you can see a black kind of a thing; there is an arrangement that is an opto coupler circuit, which i shall be telling you about
so, some places as i mentioned before will have a e to the minus j omega t convention in that case the effective permittivity will have a positive imaginary part ok
so, we have the spiral curve where we can really give height up to 6 mm
now question is that what is leading, and you have to see that out of this 2 wave form which one is reaching it is peak value
there were cracks on this side, not quite you can see them, i can see them
so i have done two examples of using the curl equation for b along with the stokes theorem to calculate b
so, it is 0 for t less than 0 and then in second case between 0 and 1 v t is equal to 4 t
if this is my speed this is the torque i am going to have probably under normal conditions without any external resistance being included it is falling maybe slightly
now this is another example
so, q let us call it
so that profit is also shown in p&l
you reduce the human resources, you think about those fixed costs which can be controlled or which can be eliminated and seriously look at the variable cost because it is very easy to eliminate and minimize the variable cost
it was not a problem beforehand because that patch was corroding so much it was kind of protecting the outside
they can be small, they can be big, they can be square, they can be rectangular
so impedance matching is that condition where the entire incident power is transmitted to the load and that happens when my load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance
they meet only once a year and that is where they review the conduct of the board
so so in this case we assume that the resistance value is two point five kilo ohm micrometer for gates resistivity
now the libc contains implementations of all the standard rather a large number of the standard c function cause that we are typically used to for example string copy, printf, scanf, fopen, fclose, string cat and so on are all present in libc so there are easily over thousand functions that are implemented in libc
so, when you are estimating seismic weight, care is to be given to calculating the seismic weight because what we are implying in this model is that the seismic weight of the structure is lumped at the floor level
so, that you know that i am going to do it to all of these equations ok
no, it is not
so, that is the price you get for a sparse system of equations there has to be there is no free lunch and that is why you lose out
for example here is now another thing is that export credit
if you go to any substation you will find this lightning arresters are there, and you will say once you visit this apparently from the distance, it will go you go to go and see all these things like lightning arresters, then ct that is current transformer, then potential transformers how the current transformers are connected, then the insulators, then the transformer circuit breakers each and everything and one can learn
5 into 1
a villager would not say that somebody has put a thing on satellite and
so whatever previous projects are there, you must maintain the various costs in some database
so, b is mu naught h in vacuum
5 or 6
so, now power loss on the account of hysteresis is actually it is an empirical formula right key or k h into f into b max to the power n into your what you call v watts right
so, next is i hope up to source i know this is up to this is source free circuit whatever we have studied
so in todayís market we use you know, different types of chemical inhibitors sorry corrosion inhibitors and supplementary cementitious materials and different type of steels, coated rebars all these are used in todayís market as a measure for enhancing service life
so, i am going to have continuously you know increasing current and after sometimes, after sometime i am probably going to see that even in this case ia is pretty large whereas if i probably look at another voltage like this, right
i have separation with the oxide material so that it acts as an insulating material between 2 metals
a dynamically allocation is done with operator new for an array of 10 characters and that pointer is stored in data
i will go to mate in this tangent, we click on this small window again
we have arrived at a layout
so, the left hand side will become summation will remain n is equal to 1 to infinity and what should i get
as it is an exaggerated emotion, we find that there are many ways in which it is expressed in an exaggerated manner by our facial features
this is going to be dollar 28,000 that is due
imagine you have an exam the next day and you are going to prepare this night, so what will you be exactly doing
for the first method focus and directrix method, we have a definition about directrix, eccentricity and focus
but using operator overloading, we can define like the operator plus we can say is the add of complex numbers, this is subtraction of complex number, multiplication of complex number, division of complex number
voltmeter reading is not the voltage across r x ok
5 electron volts which we can convert into joules if we do the numbers we get the density of states to be equal
that is path 1 multiplied by path 1 gain multiplied by delta 1 + path to gain multiplied by delta 2 upon delta
this i 1 versus v1, these curves are known as large signal curves
this is how the geda user interface will look like
so this will be definitely close to some 2500 ampere or something
so, we have done this and we have prepared this budget for us and this is the sales budget, this is the first schedule for us
so if we replace the external circuit with thevenin equivalent that is thevenin voltage vth in series with one resistance rth
ok, r square comes because this, this r vector, has a magnitude r
so this is also a travelling wave which is travelling to the left or to the negative z direction
this concept you can use for any kind of device, not necessary a bulb
so, grad phi 1 dot n hat is actually your second variable it looks like, i can derived one from the other that would be true if i were getting phi 1 is the function, then i can take its gradient, but i am not getting it as the function
so we go back to this illustration of my favourite student who used to come very late to class and very regularly at that
first we try to recover the variable cost and then we try to recover the fixed cost and if both are recoverable from the selling price then we add up some margin
support for real time file support
and in center there are interdigitated electrodes on which we have grown zinc oxide nanowires
let us mark a; perhaps let us mark point b, join them;mark it a and b
so now, lets say i make a modification
so, 50 oscillations per second what will happen
this rd and this 23 volts, this is for biasing the drain to establish a quiescent vds
so, v a n is leading v b n, v b n is leading v c n
and the device is flat now, every two second it is sending this
instead of having 180 degrees, how much i have shortened it
so, i hope that you have understood something from today's lecture, and you read it you understand further, and if you have any questions you can ask me
these are really confining the masonry structure
normally it is i keep it here
so, 2 x x prime minus 2 y y prime; divided by r plus x square plus y square divided by r square that is a
this you put and integrate it
you can provide it using a third port but by linearity exactly the same thing will happen
so, look at all the lectures that i had told i have taught you until now, and then and then only you will be able to understand how the n channel mosfet can be fabricated
so, when we applied 150 or so kilo coulombs, we see that we were getting to a situation where we were starting to stop the corrosion
uniformity of the photoresist is another thing
or maybe i will keep one year figures
you can do the calibration to previous experience
other things i think are simple to you
so value of the opening stock has come down by 20,000 and value of the closing stock has come down by the 45,000s and now the variable cost of production we have calculated is the 16,080,625 into this we are adding up 450,000 rupees of the variable selling cost because what is the selling cost here
so, whether we call it illness or whether we call it a small emotional problem which can be handled by environmental manipulation
so, the debt equity ratio is how much
so, it is 129 and 60 plus 69 both are unfavorable
so, i am going to get an alpha squared this delta x by c delta t square i will push to the left hand side cos; so, 2 cos k x minus 1 sorry 2 cos k delta x minus 2 can be simplified in terms of half angles i i will write it as sin squared k delta x by 2 right
for example, when somebody undergoes some type of a loss, personal grief, suffering etcetera
so, let me form the junction
s we have actually come to the end of this lecture and we have discussed about two important boards; one is the stm board another is arduino uno
if for example, 8 pin dual inline package, what is this size of this pin
and then doing the math, we get n i to be 0
so, the point was that, in the starting of the this particular filters lecture, i told you that the filters are generally used or most widely used in the communication circuits in the communication or systems alright ok
so, we have our experience coming to us and those experience which makes us learn to the extent that certain degree of stable change come to us
this is ok, this is one thing another optional thing can be which is very powerful is visualizing the output ok
then you talk about certain things like value chain
but in most cases, a 100 milli volt depolarization is majority used
when the downstream capacitance is large, buffering can be better than cloning
so, what will the value of this function be
in case of the labor efficiency variance now we will have to apply the formula
then we have to do a detailed analysis in terms of converting into percentages or maybe the absolute values
now imagine a situation you acquire proficiency in a particular language, you are exposed to another language at certain this stage in your life, you decide to learn a third language and there are certain specific linguistic skills that are needed to develop competence in that very area and you realize that few people do it nicely
s to rl
as i was saying that over the century many techniques have got developed
and if we do not have more than 2 non touching loops, then our delta term will end here
so, again suppose it take a cross sectional view of my coaxial cable and say if i have have my outer conductor just at this level, this point, then there will be a lot of fringing fields and this will cause the quality of the open termination to degrade
so, until now we have seen what are the oscillators
so, that takes us to normal boundary conditions and i will use
because anyway it is not going to affect, this is not going to affect the armature current or armature power factor
in case of pretension concrete system you need to transfer the stress from the strand to the concrete, to transfer the stress from the strand to the concrete you need to have transmission lengths from both ends
you use some kind of a bottom up approach
so, you can say switching in general ok
so, what is the first thing i have to do
how would you qualify
is equal to
so you see, in a dynamics c mos dynamics logic we are not using many transistors in the pull up
for ideal operational amplifier we know, right there are golden rules the golden rule is that no current flows into the input terminals, no current flows into the input terminals, right
it uses gilibc and hence the malloc would invoke a function which is present in ptmalloc2
so, this circle will be bounded by these lines and this point matches there and this point matches there; this is on the top side, this is on the bottom side
so, recent works have looked at bringing in construction detailing to limit infill damage
where we discussed about the voltage and current sources and we also saw what are the various symbols of dependent as well as independent voltage and current sources
so i am going to call this portion as energy or field energy which is wf and i am going to call this portion as co energy or wf dash
form the bulb
now, daters are going down means these are the balances with customers they have paid us
so after 30s when we had the financial accounting we had the cost accounting businesses again started coming back on the wheels
so, basis function so it is characterized by set of basis function
now, again this was meant not as a trademark, but it was meant as a means for a craftsman to tell the world that a product belongs to him or he was the creator of the product
where is the x coming from, b does not have x, but b is a a has an x
so it acts as an inductor
so, we have taken these slides from that
if we have hole and other things, we usually go with this dash dot kind of things or a circle with holes also we will be in a portion to show this dash dot lines
the threshold level can be brought down from the 1
so, now, it will copy the same value as long as enable is equal to 1
so, in the comments, you can see that actually if i specify 0, 2 as the first point, then i am actually specifying r being the name of the rectangle r dot t l is a top left point dot x is x coordinate of that which gets the value 0
if we do a coordinate transformation where we write x is equal to l d then this becomes so then now if you take out this e raise to +2gamal then this vo upon vo+ is converted to vl upon vl+
this might be the front view top view
so, if you type the word type and put an expression and either a name or an expression in the bracket, it will tell you actually type of the expression
the after thus after the switch closes the charge on the equivalent capacitance is, when switch is closed the charge on the equivalent capacitance is it will be q 1 it will be q 1 plus q 2 that is also 100 micro coulomb right
9 and 4 hour, at no load
then, there is a prepare resolver and finally the jump to plt 0
so, we can say that virtual shorting is working, it is true
numerical convergence is something that you have to do any way, but it may be that you have converged numerically to the wrong answer; i mean you have coded a consistent set of equations which are wrong like let us say you forgot the k naught squared term altogether
or this this equation also can be written i mean if you want that it will be your minus 10 plus ah your 5 i 1 plus v 0, and v 0 is equal to actually and v 0 actually it is current entering into this i 1 plus 10 entering the positive terminal
its the displacement of the string at any position x ok
turns in the secondary gauge of the wire, so on
therefore, if it is dc voltage, so i will be is equal to 0 that means, when the voltage across the capacitor is not changing in time the current through the capacitor is 0 right
for example, here we have a semi circular arc
so, the arrow direction represents we are going to retain this part and we are going to remove this part
in this lecture, firstly i will be interfacing with the stm board a bluetooth module
so, your modified circuit will now be as shown in the figure
its not be content they will be more in which
further is given that gain is 2 right
we did mortar strength and you can see that we can get upto 150 mega pascal strength at 28 days
that means new debentures are issued
so, another reason of connecting source and substrate is to avoid to many bias potential, that if i do not apply
two months, june and july
again note the notation this is a class name colon colon the static member function name
but experimental method basically it gives you accurate and objective measurement
so, you will just place the value of i x in this dependent current source, so you will get the value of 2 i x is nothing but 2 into v 1 minus v 2 by 2 and then simply i 1 is nothing but v 1 minus v 3 by 4 and i 2 is v 2 minus v 3 by 8, right so you got another equation from node 3
this is assignment 2, and we will be focusing on intrinsic semiconductors
so this is the first instance of the periodic task and as it started running, the background tasks are to wait and after its completion at this point the background tasks start running until the clock interrupt comes the periodic timer interrupt at which the second instance of the periodic task starts running and it completes only then the other a periodic and sporadic tasks start running
now the direction is this: five
so, our three cases studies are already defined x y z and this is your control, and this one this particular one this one could be a something which causes
so, that is why it is your approaching and that is qt is coulomb that is 2 coulomb and this is the current right it is the current when t is equal to 0, current is 200 ampere because when t is equal to 0 this term is 1
5 kilo newton so bolt value will be lesser of this vd sb and vd pb that means 45
so, our goal is to maintain a priority queue as a special kind of binary tree which we will call a heap
you can see the saturation i dss is reaching early and at v g s equals to minus 6 volt, you can see here it is almost call, but what if i increase v g s greater than 0 volt
so, source is delta, line voltage is equal to phase voltage, that is why here it is taken line voltage is equal to phase voltage
it just becomes it easier
vector
you need not get worried about this binding aspect right now
you must have heard this
chromatics as well as ofactics have recently emerged as subcategory of non verbal aspects of communication
similarly, if a call arise then we have to answer that call so, there is a member function answer introduced which will answer the phone call
it generally betrays a program error and requires a certain amount of programmatic response
we would first take a quick look into the error handling options that exist in c
they are already pre fabricated
so, sometime we will be taking the help of financial accounting, sometime we will be taking the help of cost accounting, sometime we taking the help of both financial and cost accounting and finally, say arriving at some relevant decisions on the basis of the information which is generated by the financial accounting and cost accounting and then we are say depending upon this information and taking the final decisions in the business
these are grid schedulers because whenever a task completes it takes up the task that are waiting and it never tries to leave any time the processor onutilized
thus, in the conduction region the current rate of a depletion time mosfet is not slower not faster, but its equal to the conduction; the current rate of change in enhancement type mosfet
the problem of course, with the survey technique is that sampling bias sometime can skew the result
you can have also solar cells that are in tandem, which means you have one solar cell on top of the other
it is using a sorting function provided in the c standard library, in the header std lib dot h
then, there has to be a declaration, with regard to inventor ship, as to who the inventor is; the name, nationality, and address of the inventor
just look at this circuit it consist of four basic element so, one is voltage source so, this is very you know very basic things we have started
so, this will cover magnetic circuit i mean basic magnetic circuits, mutual inductance somewhat
so here, it is your what you call this is the expression, this is that your e b is equal to this expression right and if your e b is equal to then k into phi into n right
this is for the previous quarter from october to december
so, that is essentially the length of the air gap itself
so that the power its speed is a constant, the torque is the one which they are changing by inputting different amounts of steam that is all they are doing, the speed is a constant, the speed will not change what so ever unless there is a power imbalance
so, those things we need to look upon when we build an application
an integrated circuit is a miniaturized low cost electronic circuit consisting of active and passive components fabricated together on a substrate
so, these are called radiation fields and this is called radiated power
this example you have shown
so; that means, only r l you are changing again and again
so, what is the current distribution on a transmission line
only
you can add an integer to it and advance a pointer
but we can't show it in the balance sheet because they are not owned by the organization but now there are concepts like hra or human resource accounting where some efforts are made to evaluate and value the human resources and put them in the form of a particular figure so there are variety of contemporary or new concepts which are coming in accounting
so, here it is minus xl upon rl square plus xl square imaginary side right
our communication through eyes goes beyond the primary function of receiving and transmitting visual stimuli to the brain
inversely right so this is going to be
the copyright act of 1957 consolidates the law on copyright in india and it incorporates provisions of the bond convention
the 40th division is clinical neuropsychology division which basically looks at the relationship between brain and human behavior they do look at psychological cognitive, physiological developmental, clinical rehabilitation, and school forensic and health aspect of psychology
ok, this is what we want, but my static timing analysis gives me a result like this: ok, fine, so the current practice, what you do nowadays, is that not only the signal transitions and the delays we separately look for rise time and fall time delays because, you see, i just mentioned during the last lecture, whenever there is a signal transition taking place in the output of a gate, actually it is driving a load capacities, so it is either charging through the pull of network or discharging through the pull down network
now what you do is you apply kcl at node at this point
so, it will be 2 into plus 2 into i 1 minus i 2 you are moving like this because i 1 is going upward and i 2 moving downwards
pin 7 is connected to the input
paralanguage is everything except the meaning of a word in a voice statement
that is the sub budget of the master budget of three months
if so, then you know this output will be plus minus dual volt or, but for a digital circuit may be dual volt is not acceptable
similarly, never ever short circuit a potential transformer, both these are literally rules you guys have to follow whenever you are using ct or pt
and this is actually what you call the second rule of the coherence principle which states that avoid extraneous words to an e learning content that your students need to undergo
let say my point s is here
r d theta which is
you may see that the whole path is not false, but at least a part of it is false
so, the distance between these two points is 0
now, where will you find these leds on the course portal
so let us again look at system what we had considered
so, it behaves in exactly the same way as before and this current here is approximately equal to v
also, remember, when this light is coming in, the particles it makes these dipoles, and the blue light is going to be radiated much more, so that power gets scattered much more, and you see it coming from all over the place
pick that distance, similarly on cd line locate c 1
the arduino board must receive the sms, depending on which it should control this relay to make it on or off
so remember, i am giving you an 8 week deadline and it better be done, by the time i get back
so i am going to have all the current in downward direction
so this array holds whole the set of pointers, and so i can go for this
here i would like to add one thing that if the firms wanted to be nearer to the budgeted results then it should be the budgeting should be like that the time horizon of the budgeting should be as short as possible
so, right hand side, it will be 40 plus 20; that is your 60 kilo ohm right
now, where do we use such kind of surfaces
so, given any pair of positive number m and n, we can definitely compute the gcd of these two numbers
so, because b lags from a, c lags from b, so phase sequence is a b c right
teacher would want to evaluate her or his students
so, it will be the indirect factory overhead
a person who has not had a; suppose a depression or any other illness in life at the age of 65 and we see lot of old people living alone these days right; kids are outside
when you will solve numericals, this thing should always remain in your mind right
you are going to pay to or with your opportunity cost or your the interest which you are going to the pay to the bank or with your int opportunity cost
then, we have seen how the enhancement mosfet works; we have seen some transfer characteristics
so, within this you count the number
so, it's very important that the workmanship and the materials used do not compromise the durability of these systems and so there are specific requirements as far as reinforcement and detailing of reinforcement is concerned and we look at few of them here
it means only with labor material and say power water, production is not possible
the inductance what you are actually putting it fictitious quantity that is also manifestation of magnetism
now, what is the value of this resistor right
instead, if i am going to have a north pole and south pole, actually repeating itself twice
now, when you try to when you try to reduce b c or what you call try to reduce the current now, suppose why i am moving in this the curve reducing the current, so it is moving in this direction
how we compile the observability matrix
and if i get a give abc for naming what i have done for abc i will get anti clockwise movement so there are very much machines available which have only ferro magnetic materials in their rotor no winding what so ever and they are really rugged you cannot really spoil them very easily because there is no question of a winding being thrown out there is no question of any winding actually you know shaking and coming out or whether it is getting short circuited all those things are completely eliminated because of which the structure is pretty much rugged
i am running over this entire region keeping r m constant
what i do
so, if in quality analysis, your e learning product gets into atd issues in issues and you get you know caught for that you will be in a very big mess
so, you have 4 s p 3 hybrid orbitals and each of them are involved in a bond
now, to be able to establish what is the ultimate capacity in bending, in plain bending of this wall, there are different models available and the model that is being referred to here is from work of tomazevich and colleagues from eastern europe
so, let us call this guy global node number 1, global node 2 global node 3 and global node 4
that polar form; that means, this one polar form is convenient to a to display 2 parts of a phasor namely it is magnitude and phase angle
now, suppose you have a situation, where you have a function in the base class, member function in the base class which you over one two overload in the derived class
now, let us understand this concept of how to solve the circuit when we have the dependent source with the help of one example
so we will look at two port non linearities and the basic principle is exactly the same as what we did for single port non linearities, just a minor extension and it could be further extended to higher number of ports
and final integration final inter point is
i was thinking about the same of designing an app like this
bts stands for base transceiver station, you see this is one person
and the second is the chain blocking problem where a higher priority task needing multiple resources undergoes inversion for each of the resources
first is to to do such relations with there is an option called mate here
other aspects which may be associated with our concept of time is our willingness to wait, the way we maintained time, during our interactions and to what extent the use of time punctuality etcetera are a reflection of our status and a part of the power game
so, these studies validate the initial suggestions and findings by paul ekman and his group
before i conclude this section, there is something that i would like to touch upon and that is the pm interaction behavior for a masonry wall
so, the section is now partial already
you have now understood the process flow for n channel mosfet
so, bringing it from up here to here, it is much less work that bringing it all the way down here
if that dot on one coilreverse the sign of the mutual, they you are the term either in equation 2 or in equation 3 will be minus i explain everything to you
and notice that the last word in elif is again an else
but when you think of a very huge application that you are trying to build, which requires higher memory, in that case stm board will be preferred
that gives us a feeling that it is not two dimensional object, it is a three dimensional object
there were cracks all along this section of the crossbeam
for example a micro kernel real time operating system which we will see later they take several even a micro kernel operating system may take several kilobytes of memory and requires running several thousands of lines of code each time a scheduling point occurs
so, we had seen that the attacker could only invoke all the functions that are present in libc
we are going to have continuous energy mechanism taking place in rotational machines
sometimes, we might require to use dimensioning by coordinates also
lets say e to the power minus alpha into two
so here what would be the first element, 5 into 10 plus 10 into 20 plus 20 into 5 divided by what we write in the denominator, we write the opposite star element
because if i am doing statically, i do not know what p a is pointing to, but now that this is a dynamic cast this will able to figure out as to whether it is actually b object in that case it gives copies the value of p a to p b
2 fy by gamma m0 into ze ze means basically so for unit length if we take 1 into t square by 6 bd square by 6 so 1 into t square by 6 this is a md which we are going to calculate as 0
infact, this example will tell you why we need to route one and two first and then three
so in that case what will be the modified circuit
therefore, , if you if you see this , if you see this that your , p 1 is equal to v a n a i a cosine theta v a n minus theta i a , theta v a n is 0 reference one and theta i a also 0
we will first start with an intrinsic semiconductor, which is a semiconductor which is pure and no dopends and we will calculate the carrier concentration in that and after we are done with intrinsic we will move on to extrinsic semiconductors
so, those are all sorts of complications
you can check this, so like p/x okay, so this is the address of glob and now if you continue executing what you see is that we have got an invalid malicious output
and if they make a decision to use a system, they it comes to the market
so therefore, the state variable model which we have just discussed is more general than the single input, single output model which we generally see in case of the transfer function
for example, this surface i can not visualize it on that plane
these are more like some adopt checks, an optimizations
and if it is reaching at h then only the action will be taken or if it is reaches at the over the minimum level then the action will also be taken
but python has a shortcut which says that you want to count from the right then we count the numbers as minus 1, minus 2 and so on
now, you can define what is a nominal strength of the material which is the value, rn, denoted here as rn
and this will be your current source; arrow is upwards right, and because here plus polarity is here and this will be your 4 ampere right
so, first thing is that n1 / n2 = 10 is to 1, 10 / 1 = 10
so, region 1 is the top part, where i have a incident plus reflected right, that is what i have
when granted a design, which is has a visual appeal has a 10 year term and the 10 year term can be renewed to a further 5 year term
now, some of the motivation for it is something that electrical engineers are already very very familiar with right and that is a concept of a impulse response
similarly, if i consider the three peers and the panel below, that is a system which is in series
so, now what we will do next step is we will grow a thin layer of oxide in this region
lap splicing is again something that you will have to take care of because reinforcement is going to go in the vertical direction all the way through the road bearing walls
that is why this has to be you have to be when we solve their solve the numerical this has to be subtracted from this one right
right, so some placement may need to be change significantly
that's basically what's been done with altering ratios of sigma 1 and sigma 2 in the orthogonal direction with different signs as well
so, here i include this member function which i will invoke from my call method
so, that is a basic difference between static and dynamic binding of course, i am just trying to introduce the semantics to you
now after passing through this amplifier, we will get outputs like this
another example is that eskimos and the chinese do not have a word their culture for anxiety
so this one example how wave equation is obtain in a system and that automatically gives you the speed of wave
so, this expression is got from the original expression for conductivity; conductivity is ne μe + p e μh; conductivity sigma is related to the resistivity as 1/ρ, and r is nothing but ρl/a
it so; that means, whatever whatever value you take tp kr tr tt tg ultimately it will give you the same statistic value whatever you got, but if you are k p and are changes naturally the steady state value our function of k p and r
moving next i have taken a small example from a mobile device because that is again relevant thing where we actually access e learning content or electronic content
so, these are the 3 methods suggesting by the committee tondon committee
r 1 x 1 for primary side, r 2 x 2 for secondary side
22 into 10 to the 4 plus pi square e iw pi square e iw 7
so, what was on the right hand side
we will look into its properties and applications
therefore, in the problem it is given how much resistance must be included per phase
so, desired ending inventory, for example, you want to keep 100 units at the end of the month which will be used the next month
so, we will string duplicate partha into the str field and keep its length in the len field and then we can print
if you calculate the operating income, so how it will be calculated
so for a built in type, the lifetime basically spans from the point of definition to the end of scope
this complication can be overcome if we assume that the curvature profile is uniform throughout the cross section but the fact is this is still conservative this is still conservative an estimate conservative with respect to the exact solution of the problem itself so if we were to assume the curvature along the height being constant, then the double integration becomes simpler
in this table we are showing the corresponding m z and m o values which we fix up at the beginning of the simulation
so, basically it is a breakdown voltage at the surge frequency to the breakdown voltage at normal system frequency, this is that called impulse ratio
and you cannot even say, the current carried by the armature is going to get reflected on to the field not at all not at all
initially, you will have some residual magnetism, it will produce a small voltage, that voltage will circulate a current through the field
now another alternative which you would have seen in some activity questions or i even discussed it in one of the earlier lessons, is to have a voltage source
so, all static objects get constructed before main starts
you can you different types of sensors for different applications
so, this is alpha is equal to 40
5 micro farad that is 0
in the setup phase we use myserial
so, in this case , you are what you call , that you find out your first i a i b and i c you find out
so, i will say that in an op amp from it is static characteristic you just absorb that the output of an op amp can take 3 different values
the forces, i should better write torque, because we are talking about angular displacement
we saw a skeleton implementation of a heap
and because of its sound similar to popcorn popping, it is also called popcorn noise; it is also called popcorn noise
then, here we have the ideal one with n 1 by n 2 is equal to a and if i call this impedance z 2 and here we have the voltage source v 1 that we are measuring
it does not have any office within the institute, it is completely managed by the third parties
so, this is remains as before over here ok
so that means, the internal resistance of so, the internal resistance of this circuit as seen from the terminal a b that is r n should be much higher than the ammeter internal resistance of the ammeter, then only our reading will be close to the correct value
so, here also now you have to apply kvl in loop one
so, the net effect will be that, there will be a current which will flow in this direction along the direction of the stronger emf
so, these are closely spaced rafters that you would normally see
so, suppose you are given this figure
so, while computing the edges or adding the edges, we are ignoring the free space wherever there is
online, offline reference materials
then you see that we are identifying if some the corrected that is given in the expression is operand or not
lets assume that there are n number of sink nodes, s one to s n
let us begin with a reflection spot
we want to add a real with a complex
so, you have to simplify by using a 3 terminal equivalent network right generally we will consider 3 terminals equivalent network for example, your this thing just hold on for this one
so we had a set of cells m by n
normally if we think of it as an amplifier apply an input to port 1 and take the output from port 2
these two are added together so i am going to get this as i naught that is that is my no load current
then which ones are the administrative overheads, office rent, office depreciation, employee salaries, all these are the administrative overheads
the other thing is cross product right
now, what is leisure
for what
so, now i have got taylor's approximation up to i have written at up to the second order what is and i want an approximation for what the second order derivative right
any any lines which are not visible and maybe perhaps at the back side, we usually show it by dashed lines
let us now see this little more rigorously
now, the equations which we have got this main equation which we got from the kirchhoff’s voltage law and then this is the value of current which is flowing through the capacitor
in the steel sector there is one source because all the captive mines of the iron ore in india, they are the control of sale
to etch silicon dioxide, we use bhf, that is, buffered hydrofluoric acid
what we would do is to neglect that component and only look at the particle with its rotational kinetic energy and the rotational kinetic energy of a very simple mass of say m moving in a circle around a point r, sorry, moving in a circle with radius r if you have to draw a simple circle around and the particle is moving on the circle with the radius r and its moss is m and its non relativistic motion then we talk about the moment of inertia i i and that's given by m r square the moment of inertia is essentially the equivalent of inertia of the mass of the mass in rectilinear motion
tnow, thus input offset current, i ios, equals to mode of ib1 minus ib2i b 1 minus i b 2, right
only one tenth of our mental faculties are consciously available to us and he drew thin line between the unconscious and the conscious state where he said that state of precocious lies and he gave interesting examples
we want to calculate the vertical load bearing capacity of the wall and these are the assumptions that we begin with
in the last session we had discussed corporate governance, the structure, the need for governance and what will happen if there is a lack of governance
when i am solving this equation, i have to choose let us there are n pixels
a reflected wave, transmitted wave those are the waves that i expect right; so, this
so we should write this as ampere turn
now how did we set up the operating point in our common source amplifier
the first thing that main would do is to push the parameters n and m onto the stack and then it would call the fact function, the call instruction would automatically push the return address onto the stack
so, it will be this power down will be cancelled and this is the idle mode
this output of the low pass and high pass filter is connected to the buffer to the voltage follower or to the buffer as you see here
then we take the total of the three and that we match with the increase or decrease of cash during that particular period
so, the average will definitely will be reduced by a factor of 2
so once we get a, we can calculate b, that is a magnetic field which is given by curl of this a
so, this i can also write as i fsd
and then you have more location specific problems like alkali–silica reactivity which happens only when you have some specific strains of reactive silica in your aggregate which is available in the locality that the concrete has manufactured
usually, the suspension bridge, the cables load has to be distributed; so there will be mass or pillars, and there will be more like a cantilever kind of suspension bridges will be there
so, this is unit frequency the characteristics it is
we need the slope of the curve i1 versus v1 which is in this graph at the operating point
so, we can change this position of this emf by changing this position of theta the angle of the third coil
so, i should be able to write this as, right, so i am going to have n alpha by 2 multiplied by whatever is pq or oq all of them are radii basically of the machine
so when all these boards are assembled together to form the system
in our next module we would look at certain other types of a smiles, the cultural differences which also exist in the way our smiles are recognised
however, note that the i dss is not the maximum current
so, we will keep the discussion limited to 1d, but now change it to a lossy medium that is the only difference and here we will find that the abc is not able to deal with it ok
so, you will not be able to call the first function
so, business cycle in what is
05 henry
now next, let us try to find the g parameters of the circuit which is given in this figure, here you will see that the circuit is having inductor of one henry capacitor of 1 farad and one resistance of 1 ohm
so prince is of 24
and i am ultimately going to look at the torque produced because of the interaction between the rotor flux and maybe the stator current
the actual parameters are not affected
in this picture imagine this is a stack and the buttons were allowed to push are pop and push let they are allowed to remove the top elements from the stack; they are allowed to put an element into the stack
you do not do not allow your label to go beyond them, because you know that your maximum length of the path is expected to be within m only
so, you will find that this is going to be the story of cem, using maxwell’s equations, boundary conditions, vector calculus you can calculate everything ok
this is how you can do programming with this stm board using a single led
so, we will go to this file and marking it save asks, us for this
so, one out of 90 is almost like 1 percent ok
now, once it is done on that box, we open it in such a way that this part comes to top so that the front view will be there, let us name it like a plane, b plane, c plane, the back side of is d plane, the bottom one is e plane, the back side of that is f plane
similarly, whatever the operations like whether i am extruding the object, making a cut, fill filling some surface, filleting, chamfering this kind of things are also some of the objects it will mention
suppose we have this column matrix for all the voltages at the various ports and say this is my impedance matrix and suppose this column matrix is the currents presents and the various ports then this matrix is my impedance matrix
now is this before we evaluate this what do you think i have a i have a singularity at the origin and i am including it in the integration i am taking the limit epsilon tending to 0
so, in that case, it is open so first you find out what is the current here, so current through this is i
so, all you are left with is a polynomial to integrate, over here for the last term will be a linear term this is a linear term multiplied by this will be quadratic right
now, v p is this
so, is d is a large task and we divide into 2 and 6
let us use other color; this line, we will see
weights so, w i and the points at which this function should be evaluated x i ok
so let's say these are the input and output terminals of this block, whatever that is, then the output versus input, that is the voltage at the output versus voltage at the input, should have a characteristic like this, which means if this v in increases v out, what is driven to the source should actually decrease
so, you will have t 1 t 2 t 3
so, this is therefore, very important ok
5 plus or minus 00 minus 005
so, if you start with a non inverting amplifier and change the plus minus sign it becomes a inverting amplifier, inverting schmitt trigger
here we have to be careful that it may be possible we have to look it from the other perspective or the rankle
ar; what is my variable of minimization is x that is written below the argmin
so, this is an example
now after 180 degree rotation a is under the influence of south pole and b is under the influence of north pole,right
i am just saying that c 2 is a friend of c 1 therefore, their name will remain to be their isolated name and certainly a class can be declared as friend in more than one other classes
so, minus 10 i 2 is equal to 0
so, hybrid model of a two port network you can define like this
since it is an open stub resonator it has to have this open and the other end it can be either directly connected or gap coupled
now, the question is where do we keep these values
this basic understanding of duchenne was later on supported by paul ekman and wallace friesen and was further strengthened
so that is the constraint on rg
similarly, in most of the societies it is considered apt that it should be the woman who offers are hand to be shaken and men normally should not initiate handshake with women
if i take square root of this particular equation
because in control theory we set up the 2 limits upper limit and lower limit and in between there is the something which keeps on fluctuating right
so, since we are targeting to detect faults on line c, we compute the boolean difference d, f, d, c
615 ohm
so, v 1 is equal to from these it is clear that i applied that kvl here only that is your 5 i 1 plus v 1 minus 30 is equal to 0 right
now in this particular example, we need to find the value of i naught with the help of superposition theorem
now, the first three stages of life, according to freud are extremely crucial for now deciding the persona of the individual, means 0 to 5 years of age
so, the algebra is fine
actually, what you are saying is also a lot of fun
now, project all these lines on to this new plane which we call auxiliary plane x 1, y 1 plane
now, one has to construct a surface, because these data points are scattered
so the resultant will be phi m itself along negative direction right
so, it gets you know expanded and compressed according to whatever you are opening, it responds that is where it is called responsive design
the modified stack with all gadgets placed look something like this, so it starts from gadget number 1 placed in this location
a head office situated in a country where the preferences for monochronic attitudes would work in a different atmosphere in comparison to another office which is situated in a country which is governed by the polychronic attitude
now, since we know that node 3 is the reference node so what we can do
you have to find out what is the speed right
the other equation i have: iscurl of e is zero and this tells me that that i can write e as gradient of potential
so, we will establish the analogy between the electricity and other analogous systems and finally talk about the state variable analysis
it is best that you look up python documentation, you may not need all variations of it, the ones that you need you can look up when you need them, but it is useful to know that this kind of formatting can be done
you could find disclosures written disclosures like lab notes or thesis or or any kind of written description of work done
even if it is not predominant, anywhere else
it will may be less at the initial time, that means this requirement specification, specification specification, specification, then again more number of people will be required during design and the highest number of people may be required during the testing time
it is not that always whenever a teacher gives you a solution, it may beis correct
now let us call this height as v p peak
so this was the expression which was used
so for example in highly acidic solutions like sulphuric acid for example you will probably not have any ettringite unless you go deep into the structure of the concrete
and the important thing is that branch currents are determined by taking the phasor sum of mesh currents common to that branch
1 henry is nothing but l volt second per ampere
now when you switch channel one, you will also see on the display, channel one
if it is unable to, then you will have to establish that this is the shear force that takes the deformation in the horizontal diaphragm to its limit, that is the actual capacity of the structure
this discussion will tell you that it is actually not possible to overload the io operator using member function either in the o stream class or in the user defined type
so the most common example for this is the transformer where the electrical device is design on the basis of the concept of magnetic coupling now it uses magnetically coupled coils to transfer the energy from one circuit to the other
so, this is one aspect that needs to be considered and there are simple numerical methods available to be able to arrive at this value
if you do for dc operating point they will become short circuits and capacitors will become open circuits
now, this switch was at position for long time at a right, that means that means circuit at the time for that case circuit was a steady state, because, switch was at this position
and in devices, we will have to form junctions between these materials
and in item 3, it's a total of 1 plus 2
and as you can guess the equivalent resistance, the incremental resistance of a current source is infinity, so the larger the value of this resistance, the more closely it approximates a current source
what is important is that you also have to connect the two power supplies whichever pain those are; you check it in the on the web
power is another side
today a conductor, by definition, has has free charges that move under the influence of an electric field and therefore it behaves in a particular way, and i am going to take its properties one by one and explain them
but, it should not work with any other numbers other than what is specified here
this is i wanted to talk about
21 for rolled section and 0
and if we again see the klopfenstein taper this purple or violet line represents the taper of the impedance frequency characteristics of the input reflection coefficient various kind of tapers and this purple line shows the characteristics of klopfenstein taper
but on the disadvantage when i come to the radiation boundary condition the disadvantage is, that this boundary condition which i just derive radiation boundary condition it was obeyed by whom
so, it will be standard cost of actual mix into 10 into 10 is the quantity and the price is 40 and plus second part is what
now imagine something like if you have seen the test materials for banking services recruitment board
so, from that perspective it may be partially correct thus the instructional designers are likely to use technology if they clearly see the benefits of technology over the old traditional practices of teaching
but how a pipeline looks like
gsm will receive an sms, and depending on that it will do some processing, and send a value through this pin 7 to the relay
one, as you see on the right, packing of particles and the other one on flowability or rheology
what people are addressing for last almost more than twenty years, or last two and a half decades, that how to develop these kind of in vitro setups which can be used for some amazing experiments, what we can think of now
is it i or f
yeah g has a b everywhere that is right
in manual drawing, we have a specialized method to construct that three point circle, using tangents and other things
so, we left the problem here with poly d lysine and i told you that you can really check it out that, how it is surface properties are changing, how it is charged behavior will change
there is not enough screening that is happening and by the time you detect it many times it is too late right and why is there such a big difference between the rural and urban india is simply access and affordability of some kind of diagnostic tool that can tell catch this early on ok
now what is marketing so you see according to american marketing association they have written in 2013 that evolve in 2013 the definition of marketing which is marketing has an activity set of institutions and processes for creating communicating delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers clients partners and society at large now marketing is a activity and the set of institution and processes okay for creating communicating delivering and exchanging offerings so they have to create the offerings communicate the offerings through promotions etc deliver the offerings at the door step of the consumer and exchange offerings for that have value for customers so exchanging offerings means selling the processes of selling were the service provider or the marketer provides a product or a service and in exchange he gets money and have value for customer clients partners and society at large so these the main segment which gets this value are customer clients partners and should be for the benefit of the society at large
now you will proceed to estimate what the area of steel would be for this requirement
so, these values of k can be different, but for simplicity let me just take them to be the same
that's why they have a lot of accumulated depreciation
either ways it is fine, n is number of turns, so i am just multiplying the flux by the number of turns and i am calling that quantity as lambda because we normally write n d phi by dt is equal to e
so, in that case they remain coordinated, they remain connected to each other and once everybody is coordinated, once everybody is connected then it is very well, it is possible very nicely that organizational objectives will be achieved
so the effective load that this driver will be driving will be this will be r divide by n
here the time is we have to calculate the time only for calculating the time but you have to take into consideration here
another point is, when the power supply is given to the circuit, there is no signngleal, byut the small noise voltages aore amplifiedr by the op amp
now, if you have the four products, a, b, c and d, all the four products may not be equally profitable
so, the force between two perfectly spherical masses, the magnitude will be equal to g m 1 m 2 over r 1 2 square, where r 1 2 is the distance between their centers and of course, the directions is attractive, so this one
this also shows you that all our calculations are consistent with each other
this is all about the connection and this part of the code is for the fire alarm
the final refinement should include, or you should really say, all the parameters of this has been varied and in quantitative phase analysis usually what we do, we refine only the scale factors in the lattice parameter
r is equal to a times h becomes
one is the material, this is the labor, this is the other overheads, this is a prime cost and now this is the next item that is the factory cost or the total factory cost
finally, to close the on c programming language, you know there are input, output functions available in the stdio dot h
so, we have to calculate this yield variance by a formula standard rate into actual yield minus revised standard yield and in this case the standard rate will also change
in addition to understanding the cultural differences our understanding of the context is also important so that the totality of the meaning can be directly understood
so if it is vc that we are talking of the control voltage, it is having a vc operating point value plus variation in the neighborhood of the operating point value
these were the major problem of the simple priority inheritance scheme
okay but essentially the activity that student would have to do to enter any kind of content irrespective of its format would be the same right or would it be different
so we are looking at field flux changing which means i am going to have here the armature i am going to keep very clearly va as a constant because i told you only one thing is changed at a time
that you can always vary
we tested it out in the laboratory
also we see formation of aluminum hydroxide
that also helps us in connecting the electrostatic potential with those situations and may give us some insight
it your cost and revenue now if you want to be profitable normally you will need more revenues than the cost and if you are consistently profitable the business or the organization will become healthy and strong and it will also help you to last longer
so generally when you have no non touching loop or only few non touching loop you can utilize the mason’s formula easily find out the transfer function
i mean will not this happen; there is a possibility that there will be repeated return stroke, you have to follow the same path
we are focusing on integrated circuit
it means what part of the sales is on the cash, what part is on the credit, then how the credit sales are going to be collected and then you have to go for the other input budgets, sub budgets, that is the purchase budget, purchase disbursement budgets because as we are going to sell part of our production or this firm's production on credit
now u minus t is equal to 30 when t less than 0 and 0 when t greater than 0
similarly for node 2, you can write i x is going in and i 2 and i 3 are going out, so i x would be equal to i 2 plus i 3, what is i x
and interestingly he said ‘okay
nowadays we use lot of pretension concrete members in bridges in the form of girders, high rise buildings in the form of slabs and railway sleepers etc
so, the total shareholders funds were 48% now it is 47%
now, we can describe any interconnected network with the help of these 6 parameter sets, but there are certain sets or parameters which may have a definite advantage, how
lets call it c five, c six, c seven, c eight, c nine, c ten, c eleven and c twelve
then after sometimes again the next falling edge will come and again the system will get another interrupt and when it gets another interrupt again the same the interrupt service routine will be invoked
exceptions, as i mentioned, are the design of high volume products such as high performance microprocessors, which are expected to sold in plenty, memory chips and of course fpga chips, which are also sold in very large numbers
suppose let me use a new slide for this suppose i have a simple network like this itõs a simple series reactants, letõs say z1 and z2 being the characteristic impedances at port 1 and port 2 respectively
if we are picking c point normal will be in that direction, tangent will be in other direction
so, the growing child basically becomes biologically more and more matured, interacts with environment and he learns out of his interaction or her interaction with the environment
so, now, just as i had a convention for local edges, that let us say from smaller node number to larger node number, similarly i can have a convention for the direction in which a global edge should point
so for example, if i am looking at a particular lambda value here maybe this lambda is let us say lambda 1, i should be able to get w f at lambda 1 flux linkage, for this magnetization characteristic will be zero to lambda 1 i d lambda
now, the idf is referred to an in house attorney and after the preliminary discussions a decision is taken whether to file a patent and how to file the patent
so, this term over here is a constant the next term over here l i of x what is it
wha, where are the holes in the protocol
so the circuit would look something like this
so, these will not be allowed, but it is quite ok if you actually take a pointer of any type and put it to a void pointer
so, what is here what is written here
now, if load is zy, we can write it as z angle theta
later on we will put a small r equals to capital r, so just ah, mind this
that is because the frame, last frame boundary coincided with the major cycle
remember that board is now a dictionary
so, for that purpose what we have to do
so, i can always give some other kind of hashed kind of colors for example, i would like to give saffron
it is all connected together now from here the current is going to emanate and i am going to have the resistance connected like this
and then, it should be possible that the corresponding function will get called
the gate source voltage equals v0 minus iirm
so, in a 3 port device, if all the ports are matched, then our s parameter matrix looks something like this
so, multiple information up to 2 seconds, this is what happens at the level of eyes and this is called iconic memory
so, liabilities are giving you the providers for the resources or there are internal people like owners who have given us owners funds
what is the fundamental symptom for which we have to do this
concentric coil is what just now sayyam told, so i will have probably my primary here
in the glass box method, we construct an imaginary box around this object; some of them are transparentplanes, some of them are opaque planes
therefore, here you can write p rotor copper loss s p g is equal to 3 i 2 dash square into r 2 dash this is equation 20
so, we have these dashed lines and an axis line pass through that hole
now, we will look at how to do incremental analysis when we have nonlinear two port elements in a circuit
then if we connect resistance rb in series at the output or conductance 1 upon ra in shunt at the input then again we can get or we can shift the positions of this stability circles, so that they become like this
so, what i have done is to replace this with the small signal incremental equivalent of moss in saturation region, because in saturation region we have the characteristics which are desirable to make a good high gain amplifier
now, let's see few of the properties of laplace transform
and if i substitute that in here, this part will get cancelled out and i will get 2 times id divided by vgs minus vt
similar is a case of a multi y if then else, like a switch construct, some branch is never taken
by the way, in all of this analysis we have omitted the small signal output conductance of the mos transistor but if you do want to include it it is very easy
so, very important you had to understand
that from sensory to short term to long term this is how the memory moves and it is long term where the information is stored now how much of information is now pushed in and how much of it can actually be retained that is a matter so somewhere you can visualize this theory in little symbolic order say for instance you have attached a pen drive or an external derive okay or a sd card okay in the system and then you realize that it says that your external device your pen drive or your sd drive has this capacity say for instance it has one tv that is the size okay
for example, if we are going to pick some point here in between p3 and p4
so he was a captain and later became an admiral with the royal british navy
now, here the question is why corporates do budgeting
as far as
i have mentioned, across layers, the capacitance, this block, the solid block shown as black
standard time was double 2
and then unskilled was 8 we have paid 10 and here also we have paid 2 rupees extra so it means this all has caused the total labor cost variance to be negative though the efficiency has compensated to some extent but since the price paid was very high or there was a difference in the price paid actual price as against the standard and number of man evers are also very high 200
so, once again vo represents the barrier that the electrons have to overcome in order to go from the n to the p side
at 1, 2, 3, 4 fluid leaving would have that component in the x direction and therefore, fluid leaving the volume the box through 1, 2, 3, 4 is going to be equal to the component of v in the x direction coming out of the volume times b c again
they are a different kinds of relative advantages of technology that may be considered
and, but question is the wires are of made of copper conductor i just told you and had insulator from one another by electrical insulation coating the your coating the wire that you have seen that you have seen
this test method is based on the standard astm a1081 with a slight modification required for pretension concrete systems, because the astm a1081 suggest the use of unstressed strands in cement grout, just typically for the post tensioning scenario which suggest the use of 450 mm long cylindrical specimen with 125 mm diameter
so will go into index 0 and we will look at the type of cache which is present over here and the type is d, data which indicates that this particular cache represented at cpu 0 index 0 is a data cache
if it is first quadrant method by light if we are projecting it the opaque is this one opaque opaque plane on which this entire object will be projected
so, what will be the, if i do not want to do any additional calculations, i just want to give some input to the systems i said my output is itself the impulse response
earlier i have offered a course that is financial analysis and reporting
so, this is a simple circuit that your 23 shows series combination of n inductors, where voltage v is there l 1 l 2 l 3 all are up to l n all are connected in series current flowing to this i voltage across l 1 is v 1 and l 2 is b 2 like this across l n in v n right, so this is series connection of n inductor
now, in a typical data path, when digital portion of a circuit, we encounter such kinds of circuit where there are a number of flip pops or storage cells, there are combination circuits in between
so, to remove the drift we put a resistor rf across the capacitor in the feedback and then, we have performed the experiments and we have applied different signals and we have seen the output at the integrator, then we took our differentiator
but this is unwanted signal for the for the or this cause noise pollution right, this cause noise pollution
so, that is a what conductivity will be associate with it infinity right
the code has been dumped
where will dividend received go
and to get the total solution here, what we do is we sum the operating point quantities which are these and the incremental quantities from here
so, you may remember or you may have seen somewhere in high school mathematics that if you take the point x, y then an alternative way of representing where this point is to actually use polar coordinates
and we also took one more maybe rod kind of structure which will be attracted by this electromagnet, if sufficient current flows through this
that kind of weightage we will apply to really map these two curves by joining a line and try to construct a ruled surface
so, you can see accounting period concept
so, we had to diffuse the dopant which is n type dopant because we are creating an n channel; channel should be n channel mosfet
say ground, we are routing from the left and vdd from the right
we can also provide examples and applications in various contexts and if we know that our learners come with different interests this is something we should do that when we give examples or when we give our students to work on applications of a part particular concept, we vary the context in which the application happens
ok, and they say they, they work on cantilever principle
for instance, in our country we have the cars with the steering on the right side
the value of rupee to dollar will change in the beginning as well as in the end
similarly, we have dodecahedron, icosahedrons and different kind of objects, these are commander category of polyhedra
so, if you specify a qualified symbol, name qualified symbol then whenever later on you just talk about the symbol name, it will mean this qualified symbol
remaining finished overheads, administrative expenses, selling and distribution expenses will treat them in the income statement or in the profit and loss account which we will prepare in the next class and then analyze that which are the components of the cost contributing to the say to increase the cost and if you want to reduce the cost then we have to focus upon those particular components elements and then we have to reduce the total cost of the production and increase the profits so remaining discussion and preparation of the income statement in this problem we will discuss in the next class
g is a virtual function in b,s so it will do a polymorphic dispatch, it will be decided based on the type of object that q is pointing to which is s c type object, therefore, this will invoke the g function in the c class because it is decided by the type of the object
and your own sadness when you relook at it in terms of the output that it has yielded, you also feel happy about it
so, if you talk about the factory overheads you have to find out those items of expenses which are required in the factory
here you are loading r0 to r2, and the last one will be loaded to pc
and background there is so many layers i can see all shades of green
so, or you can say 520 millivolts
so, what we will do is we will assume a simplistic model rather than compromising on the calculation we will assume a simplistic model of this frequency dependence of permittivity and see if we can if that saves us from saving the entire time history
this is what is called skew
so in this way we can calculate and the formula we know that an will be equal to b minus ndh, plus psi square by 4gi into t
because skilled worker will be costly, expensive as compared to the semi skilled and semi skilled will be expensive as compared to the unskilled
now, let me take another coil which i will put on this horizontal plane like this
so, i have to use this guy, this guy and this guy as per the formula
so i have just now said that the circuit under test is when you are applying the test data
now given this particular pointer, can read or write or manipulate data present in that heap chunk and at the end of usage we can then free to the buffer and after the buffer is freed that chunk of 256 bytes which we have just allocated in the heap can be used by other malloc which may be present in the program
because in 5 time constants the circuit voltage is there, then voltage value will decrease to less than 1 percent of its initial value so, the value of time constant is small or large will not impact, the steady state time, it will always be 5 times of the time constant
so, it is very involved and have a lot of variability even if you are going to be using calibration, using empirical correlations
so, as long as so, the wave is travelling over here my e and h are going to be in orthogonal directions for a plane wave right
so, if this is going to be my external characteristic were i am drawing the variation of what is the terminal voltage with reference to the armature current that i am drawing
one can also link the net cash from operating revenues to the operating profits
he is not concerned about that what is called gate and actually he every time he is going to buy the toothpaste so he is buying a call
next is cash from financing activity
this principle of constructive alignment is the underpinning concept in the curriculum design and development to achieve the intended learning outcomes
they cannot be any charge distribution inside the metal
so, for a 3 d solid we found that the density of states increases with energy it goes as a square root of e for a 2 d solid the density of states is essentially just a constant for a 1 d solid
it is, we can say, the how often utterance where is the language is what of the content it is how we have spoken any word and often we find that how we say is more important then what we say
what is negative resistance region with a very point where is a saturation region
so, we are able to and this was important because in fdtd we want time update and we here we got the correct relation between d and e right
similarly, if one is interested in constructing an ellipse first one data point one has to pick, second data point, then if you are moving it around you will see the ellipse
first of all it allows the learner to be able to follow the process or to fall the units much more easier
so, it becomes the relative permittivity comes in a way
and then i will take up certain findings of behavioral genetics to tell you that how is it that people give credit for that type of situation to the genetic makeup as well as to the environmental factors, the external factors
the point is that the transistor is a unilateral device
i would write that down
and the load will be coupled through a second capacitor c2
25 kilo newton meter
ah, let me try to understand what interconnecting model is all about
so, the variable which you have seen x2, x3 and so on are somehow defining the derivative of the previous variable so with this you can specify the system performance that is present or future condition of the system
so the sizes of each of the vertices can be different in general
now this is during the journey that the mother is going through with a child, so this we are open to seeing what all can probably go on your customer’s journey and this is after what is the emotional state
so, whatever is the reading i am getting from the wattmeter i would call that as the rated core loss or no load loss
because these functions are oscillatory in nature and does not have the final values
on the other hand, on one and three it is zero
here, we have this track and this wheel
we have looked at some of the timing driven routing strategies and techniques that can be used in the routing phase to keep the timing constraints in check or they are not getting violated
so, 180 watt or p is equal to your v square g, that is your 30 v is 30 volt
single frequency
now, whatever the length ab, the same length mark it as a and b on this isometric plane construction
so, i can also write this in centimeter cube or 8
so they can actually be manufactured to sizes that you really want to work with
output power, maybe i am giving it to an induction motor, i am giving it to a resistive load, i am giving it to probably a heating unit, maybe i am giving it to whatever apparatus i am having
so, stands to reason a next step to take is let us fit a parabola through this function right
there are two words, one is the storekeeper and another is the warehouse
if this second one is better than the first one, because, here you are here, height of the layout was becoming larger, right
and if we then take the ratio of these expressions that comes out to 1 gamma in upon 1+gamma in equal to z1 upon z2 upon…
let us start with the brief recap of last class
yeah, well that is again should we say that is the statics approximation
so, span length is given 300 meter
so we have talked about fields, potential in free space and near a conductor
so people have built
16
so, that i wrote was equal to j omega epsilon e there is no current term over here and further let us just make it epsilon naught because we had discussed previously that the between the interface i mean at the interface between vacuum and pml epsilon mu were the same right
okay, so we will start off with equivalent circuit once again, okay
look at this is very simple
so, there is a rule which dictates as to how i can implicitly convert an integer to a double or a double to an integer, whether i can convert a pointer to a certain type into a pointer to wide and so on
now, there is one more topic known as subsidiary books
it will be too expensive, right
because we have taken very long conductor initially, then we have placed the second conductor which is also carrying 1 ampere of current and we have placed them apart by 1 meter so i should say that this is the force that we are getting between these 2 conductors
fc = 1 / what is the formula for the low pass filter for critical frequency fc equals to 1 upon 2 pirc, we know it beautiful
so, that is why we are not looking at the table or a column in the table to measure the frequency, alright
so, same block diagram same thing that i showed you this simple derivation i showed you here right how we are getting it
what we have covered today is we have started with cash flow statement, the importance of flow statement the three categories operating investing and financing particularly today we have discussed operating activities if it is bit difficult for you to understand don't worry in next session we are going to revise operating and again look at also look at investing and financing which will make the operating activities once again more clear
on the other hand, when it goes clockwise, it is stopped
we have been able to control the rate of the skilled labor but in case of the unskilled labor and in case of the semi skilled labor, the rate paid was higher and maybe some time it is beyond the control of anybody within the organization because labor comes from the outside
now since it is lossless, it should satisfy the unitary condition and from this equation we get the following equations
so the priority is a increasing function of the task arrival rate
so we kind of find out the value of theta m and from there we can find out the value of, uhh; we can find out the value of delta theta and we have a term called fractional band width
i first compute the and of those two vectors, lets call it z
so what i mean to say is that you have one row up cells here, you have one row up cells here
so, there is not much application for the series capacitor in the distribution system right
so, multiply by this 60
and, the computer will then display that value on the screen in the form of an waveform ok
now, let us see that if you want to use the differential amplifier and you want to see whether it is working or not in case in terms of experiment, how to perform the experiment
so, usually for solidworks we see it on the left hand side, somewhere here we have that feature manager
so, that you can understand side view, side view, side view, side view or you can say cross sectional, cross sectional view
beyond merely nourishing the body, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals, communities and even countries”
because this gain, v0 by vs, which is minus gm, rd, parallel, rl, parallel rds
we can make use of this formula, just substitute na and nd and then the values of ni for the different materials
once we click that, we can click ok
when we solve that we will get equivalent impedance in s domain that is nothing but r by 1 plus src
but, if i write it as an initialization list, the compiler follows a unique approach
so once you route one may be, you find the order of the other
so, you can have this you can connect that device to port 0 and through this pull up resistors and as a result you can put you can put high current onto those ports; over those devices
so one way of realising is if we have our length tuned properly of this open stub and say the resonant frequency is such that it corresponds to the high impedance state of this gap coupled resonator then that is an implementation of a shunt resonator in shunt
so, in many places you may want to return by reference
this will again change the carrier life time and that will again affect properties like the conductivity and also the quantum efficiency
use a scale
now, the question is what are these scatterers that we talk about, and how do these values depend on temperature
but the point is, you if you want to measure slew rate follow the steps and you will be able to measure the slew rate
you can have a look at it
these are all very convenient functions that python allows us to call implicitly, and allows us to use conventional operators and conventional functions in our code
you can also go for debt to asset ratio, interest coverage ratio, and the last three ratios are particularly useful for shareholders which are in the form of pe ratio, dividend yield and so on
so, ultimately the pin is getting affected; so, that way we can do the output operation on to the pins
now, i would like to make one more pattern like maybe an octagon i would like to construct here a small one
so, let us see again come back to the slide
there is a nice theorem from numerical analysis which we will not prove over here, but it says that for orthogonal polynomials the roots are always real and distinct, we will just use it ok; so, for orthogonal real and distinct roots alright ok
subsequently in c99, a change has been made to introduce a bool type
so, substitute all this value because, all this values are known right
so, torque speed relationship is basically a linear relationship which i can plot somewhat like this
i mentioned one problem which is called internal resonances
so, for those students who do not know this is what i am showing it to you for those students who already know it is kind of refreshed
so, this is the motion flux lines are upwards and this is the direction of the emf ok
if you go back to that lecture you will notice that in deriving this formula along the way there was a term which was proportional to del dot j, which we said was zero because of this steady current
now, also this is the gradient in spherical coordinates right so, let us write that down
if you decrease this slack to zero, this r a t will also become one, because r a t minus a a t is slack
so, this is the lowest bank having the registers r0 to r7 then we have got bank one going from r0 to r7
so, coming back to the slide, so we, for every vertex v belonging to capital set of vertices, the requirement is the actual arrival time should not be grater then the required arrival time
so, the plus point is, no need to store entire history of e and h and the minus point is store one new aux variable auxiliary variable what which is psi
coolterm can be downloaded from several sites
so, what we do is after removing this entire materials thing, we revolve it down all the way; because we would like to see something like a complete view in this direction
so, that emf is induced in the armature as in a generator right
maybe the clock source cannot drive the current to a hundred or thousand points, so i need buffers to amplify the current
so, let us use a generating line 2 pi r we have to do
normally we have a capacity to listen somewhere around 650 to 700 words per minute and i am talking about and averagely educated person
to save the time, some cases i made it like this
randomize va space and specify a value of 0, 1 or 2, the support for aslr can be modified for your particular system
minus h plus
so, o a is the maximum value of your what you call of a sinusoidal quantities
so, say in the in one cycle current is flowing partly through this resistance not its not going completely through the meter ok
so, why someone is doing what he or she was doing why people think the way they think, why certain type of acceptance rejection certain types of gossip certain type of rumors certain type of preconceive notions why some people are you know touristic and some or not all those in our dynamics of human behavior you would be very easily able to decipher and this in turn will make you extremely effective at your work place
so, here we certainly go for as a customer, we go for looking for the best quality product
so, with the help of assigning the particular values of y dot and y double dot you can simply find out that the equation which we just saw can be represented with the help of signal flow graph
what happens at this point is, these are point where the scope of strtoupper ends
so, in the last lecture, we had a very basic introduction to real time systems
60 right and p is equal to vi cos theta
they are generating the power, they are transmitting the power and they are distributing the power and they are distributing the power
then if you single phase for the same power loss; for the same power loss right that volume of the conductor is 33
so, this kind of problems exist for this perspective drawing
so, this ensures that the data that was dynamically held up in this data member of the stack class can be released at this point
let us say i am able to measure this with the help of you know a multimeter or whatever and i know the values, so i can say i0 times rs is a series resistance, fine
this is the current i that moving going to this terminal this this node right
probably it is the brain mechanism which are doing it, brain as to bring to it homeostasis, the brain itself does not like that dysphoria the not feeling comfortable and more or less the societal stuff also
42 e v
so, if you are given an example of a differentiator, if you are given an example of a differentiator such that a sin wave 1 volt peak to peak at 1000 hertz is applied to a differentiator with the following specification, rf is given, c 1 is given, find the output waveform, find the output waveform
so centrifugal force is something will open it
and when you are trying to return back, you will have to jump back to the address that is stored in r14
negative sign; so, this expression can also be written as; can i write it like this dot
the example that i will be taking here is a bulb, and that bulb i will switch on by sending an sms
here was our basic algorithm for gcd, which as we said more or less follows the definition of the function
well, that can act as a series resonator or a shunt resonator depending on the frequency
so these two terms are defining the instantaneous power
so, address which has only one type that is of the pointed type, but their type is decided based on what kind of value they are actually pointing to
so, similarly for n th capacitor up to n 1 upon cn t 0 t it dt plus t n t 0 right
4586 kilo watt
so, 1 variance is activity level variance because the activity level has come down from 7 to 6 and then the flexible budget is that for the 6,000 fine 6 lakh has come down as the sales so have all actual expenses reduced proportionately at least the variable expenses or it is a situation that your variable expenses have not changed fixed expenses are not expected to change so the cost has remained the same sales have come down and the profit either has become a loss or the profit has proportionately come down that is the main objective here so two type of the variances we calculate here and these two variances are called as that when you compare the flexible budget of 6 lakhs with the actual results of 6 lakh it is called as the flexible budget variance and second is when you compare the budgeted information for static level of 7 lakhs with the flexible budget for 6 lakh that for the 7 lakh this was the performance expected
now, let us try to look at how the single phase induction motor works
finally, operators are necessarily predefined, functions can be defined as and when needed
now, where will you find these lbds
in the implement phase of addie, we will train the instructors or the users of these materials, we may even create short videos and insert it into the e learning on how to use the materials, we will make sure learners have access to the materials, equip infrastructures and so on
now, why is there blank lines between every line in our file that is because when we readlines we get a backslash n character from the line itself
s c
so, from equation 2 and 3, we will get upon simplification all these things we get v 1 is equal to 1
it drops by 1 by e right that is how we define bandwidth roughly right
why we want to study the behaviour
so, this is estimated as 0
these are the string manipulation functions and we will look at some more of them, but this is just useful one which has come up immediately in the context of file handling
so, for instance, if you want to say that if we do not specify the x and y coordinates over a point then by default the point will be created at the origin
test plan is expected to take 5 weeks and testing is expected to take 25 weeks
so, the overall energy that it can dissipate is definitely higher than compared to a situation where you are assuming hinged hinge at the top and the bottom
now, timing driven placement techniques can be broadly categorized into three types
i cannot distinguish, because under the each of these three faults the function changes in a same way: it is becoming zero, a constant zero function
so, v c b is equal to v l, i c is equal to i l it will be cos , cos 30 degree minus theta right
so, in the previous demonstration we looked at runtime relocatable code and we have seen that it requires that the loader have a lot of things to do and it requires the loader to go and modify the code and fix the address in each of the locations and a lot of this becomes much more simplified with a pic, a position independent code
this is a 2d thing
in the last classes, we have learned about different kind of quadrants an object located, in the 1st quadrant, 2nd quadrant, 3ird quadrant, and 4th quadrant
and for exercising the cost control, you always hit on the item which is biggest in amount
so, i have my operator l, now phi i am going to write in terms of these guys
so i 2 by i 1 will now become minus of n 1 by n 2
so, when it is switching on at t is equal to 3, so, this will be actually 10 u t minus 3, right
lets see this two terminology, skew and jitter, which are related to this distribution problem
so, we have studied pocklington integral equation right
rotor itself is a short circuit thing so this is r 2 resistance this s x 2 it is given as a your what you call that a variable symbol right
however, in the dressing room it is still normally a hands off policy
both has anode both has cathode
and this interrupt enable register; so, we are enabling the interrupt slight e a b set to 1
let us continue
this is let us extend the scale so that we can draw a tangent to that circle, parallel to that we have to move to construct parallel lines
this is the actual arrival time on pin j
hey, hi
so, they are basically, different functions
so, this is sort of what we did; if you want it to be more sophisticated going back to the very original question i asked the start of the module, what would you do instead what could you do instead if you want it more accuracy
so, it will go to a positive terminal and that positive terminal is my drain because my vds is applied in this particular fashion
so, what is written here
so, how much was paid at the end of july
we have provision for having photos of our contacts, so will have some helper class as photo which will have image and the alternate text for the image and so on
it reduces the magnitude and the steepness of the wave front that corona it reduces both that your magnitude as well as steepness right, within a few miles to a safe voltage
it may be possible that temporarily because of the increased competition in the market because of the market dynamics or entry of the new players in the market, maybe the new players are very efficient in the market
the ratio of new gm to the old gm would be square root of kn prime by km
so, this second part over here is moving from 0 to t as m is progressing and on the other hand as m is progressing this electric field value see tau keeps increasing
how it gets induced we are going to see, the principle of operation
we represent sinusoid like vt is equal to vm sine omega t
and capacitor bank is a total assembly of capacitor modules electrically connected to each other
and, similarly many a parents they start over expecting from their kids
i would like to start with simplest of books, basically for electrical machines, although some of the topics i mentioned may not be covered very well in this book, nevertheless for a beginner it is very very easy to read that book so i would rather recommend that book, this book is written by p
similarly v 3 is equal to v 2 minus i 2 z 2 put this v 2 value here and this i 2 and z 2 value here right and calculate
so, the yoke through the yoke it returns the magnetic field line return
we can only turn off the independent sources which are connected to the network while leaving dependent sources connected to the circuit
and cooling in brief air in small transformers and oil in large transformers, right cooling is a huge chapter, rightin a in a electrical engineering for transformers
we are not violating energy conservation principle, very clearly
so, let us say i1 is the mesh current in mesh 1, i2 is the mesh current in mesh 2 and voltage across terminals ab is vth
now, let us give something like minus 5 mm
if we find two people opting for the same position and facing each other the dialogue is confident and yet it moves in a positive direction
when we meet a person for the first time then we quickly glance at a person and on the basis of what we see, we make an immediate judgment on the basis of these cues
yeah, like this course for example, for our students here they have a sort of mechanism that they are making sure that yes, i have learnt this topic well
hope you have understood this, little bit understanding is required
so, even j is a function of r
so, it is connected like this, but in between there are many other things
ok, and therefore the x component is going to be whatever small b is coming from this current here, which i am showing in black, which is mu, not over two pi times i, which is going to be k, d, x polynomial length is k divided by square root of x square plus z square and is component in the x direction, which is in sin theta, which is going to be z over square root of x square, z square
so, it will be minus 24 e to the power minus t 0 to infinity put this values you will get it is 24 joule right
so, we are done with that center rectangle also
again part drawing, click ok, go to frontal plane, we would like to have a circular disc
now, next is filters can be passive filters, can be active filters
so that is something which we have to look at in more detail to try and understand how we can control the durability of the concrete in the structure
so in this way various tasklet are created only after their signatures are authenticated
so, this is my , this is my your what you call that, watt this is my wattmeter and it measures the power p 1 and, load is taken as a star say
so when you solve it, you will get this, anyways it is given in the question that vp is equal to 110 angle 0
could be anything it could be for example, you know some bridge or cracks in concrete that is what civil engineers use these kinds of applications; let us say i have some structure and i do not want to i cannot open it up right
it is said also about the intellectual achievement context in which our competence is evaluated, where red is associated with failure and green is associated with success
so, for example, they consider a 90 degree bend in the waveguide which you would not be solve analytically right
so, n c is nothing, but 2 times 2 phi m e star k t over h square whole power 3 over 2, n v is 2 times 2 phi m h star k t over h square whole power 3 over 2
and when your market is only 2%, 1% or 3%, as against your standard estimate of 20%, you how big or how strengthful you might be, you have to miss revise your pricing system and then you have to bring it up to a level where we are able to recover the total cost, fixed cost and the variable cost and add some profits
let us discuss about the basis of the dcdc converter
number of transistors will be much, much higher, so number of possible faults will also be much higher
these deformations because these deformations are different you will have an increase in the compression that will occur across a compression structure that can form and this is the resisting mechanism once the interaction between the frame and the panel starts getting activated
and the highest protocol requires that when a task requests a resource, then the priority of that the task is raised to the ceiling value
so, its come 110 ohm similarly rb is equal to numerator will be remain same divided by r 2 20
therefore, what will happen you can write n 1 minus n 2 upon n 2 into n 2 upon n 1 volt ampere auto right
if there are some specific taxes on investing or financing related items, we will show it under the respective head
corrosion must be getting lower
the metric threads for that purpose there is a symbol m perhaps it might be having a diameter of 12 mm
now, output is equal to 15 kva at unity power factor
so, this is without common ground
so in the driving circuit it will be r by w, the inverter, the load capacity will load c, w and here for the r c delay for each segment, it will be ah r w by n
now, what happens this static characteristic or the property of the op amp that says that at this value of input ok
the wave is travelling in any direction no the wave is travelling is incident on it in any direction that is what we showed this reflection coefficient that we had
there was a very strong relationship with enron and political parties
output will even decrease
so, here your v 2 is equal to 20 minus 40 minus 20 volt because v 2 we got your what you call v 3 you got 20 volt because i told you that v 3 you got 20 volt
so, ice crystal will be their positive i told you that if you reach 5000 kilometer or so, above the ground temperature of 0 degree and after that it become minus
so node will be the connection between the two or more branches, here in this figure we have three nodes, node a, node b and node c
the p type transistors are coming in series, right, so now the issue is that if you have a scenario where there are more complex ah gates you are trying to implement
so alternatively, what you can do is look for checking other way you can do, it i is equal to v upon z 2, z 2 is the surge impedance of the cable and refracted voltage is actually we got 19
this corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1100 nanometers
so it is provided by the yoke, so this will be our yoke
let us do that
still we are helping out one person but we need to understand the other person’s perspective also
this also means that b has components b, y and b z only
so, let us understand how the input bias currents affect the amplifier operation, we will see few of the parameters and we will see how they are affecting the operation ok
so, welcome for to all of you for this particular module
now the question arises: this is source, this is drain, or the reverse, and this is the channel
here the failure is governed by sheer tension, right
similarly, in water waves i create a disturbance that travels from one place to the other, but water does not go from one place to other
and wwe should know a law called lenz’s law; lenz’s law
for example, this is another arc
that way you can make the clusters or the partitions grow
i can have instead a short shunt i will show you just by a difference, so i am going to have the armature here, i can have the shunt just coming across like this and then i am going to have the series feel beyond this
so, save
the solution is that this quantity, gamma 21 which is dependent on the difference of z2 & z1
in that limit we get v one is equal to minus sixty
now when you talk about structural analysis part you know you have only this much amount of steel left, so the remaining this much is lost actually so it is not that good thing to see because if you have uniform sectional loss then it is relatively easier to detect the problem and you can actually do an assessment and here it is very difficult to assess what is the residual capacity of the structures because you have this pitting which is happening at random locations, so it is very difficult to assess the residual capacity because of this
at the chance of a and c, or b and d or a or d having a bridging will be much less because there is a wiring between
so, we have a significant amount of error
so thus we can infer that k0 xor k4 would be equal to 50 and if we go back to what we have kept the values of these keys we have k0 and k4 is 50 and thus we see it matches the results that we obtain
and we define this relay1 as 7
so, any horizontal plane for a right circular cone if we are slicing it, we will see it as circle here, this is the circle
so, where is the remaining gap
that the equations will take care off; because when i impose this weighted residual condition
what we are given we are given gain is given and then beta is given correct
so, accordingly you can have a system where you can put this touch sensor along with the application where whenever somebody touches the sensor an sms alert will be sent to your mobile
we have studied this and we have also simulated this
if it is a meter, then it will be your meter square, if d is in meter
then, it will become put in this expression, then it will become 2 pi b a n sin theta volt, right
so the sat formulation goes like this: this is the most important step: whenever you are using sat to solve a problem, you have to map it properly
so, we also saw that the property of these 3 elements and also saw what is the ohms law
so, your i 2 is equal to will be minus 2 ampere right minus 2 ampere so; that means, i 2 is known
it helps them to give messages to each other and letting people know their affiliations
that means line voltage will be equal to phase voltage coming across the load impedance
this may so happen depending on the behavior of the circuit
you can write v 1 divided by the impedance of the complete branch
but as a thumb rule i would say rather 99
again, the next step is now she has to take off her helmet and scarf and probably pack it inside the trunk of the vehicle
so, just start off with
because ac was able to transfer the power at a longer distance, losses were less and it was easier to generate for a higher voltage
so if you put these values in this, you will get p loss divided by p dash loss equal to 2 times of r dash square divided by r square
so if you simulate this whole circuit now, so you have modeled the driver, there is an inverter which is driving effectively
that a leaders; return stroke will be going from this your earth to the your what you call to that cloud
this is an important distinction to understand because patent law comprises of stuff substantive provisions for instance what can be patented is a substantive provision and it also comprises of procedural aspects
shown here and what we see over here is the delay in clock cycles and over time
so, the input is applied to gate source and the output is taken between the drain and source terminals
these individual cells
this is a different representation because the action on the wall is different
from the last couple of modules we have been discussing about inheritance in c++
the pole connected to t1 as shown here
cost per worker is not changing
so, let us go to their net profit or profit for the period which is 715
and slowly with the advancement of technology, we came to the present technology which is our ic
so, you have aluminum, gallium arsenide can also have gallium arsenic and phosphorus for the higher wavelengths or the lower bind gaps can again have indium arsenide base materials, cadmium and mercury
only the
mosfet's are metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
so this is what we did with the common source amplifier and that is what we do now
so, this pml is not for normal incidence this is this is going to absorb any wave that is incident on it
very similar to recall: if i have a capacitor and i turned a current on through a switch, the current builds up slowly, or the charge in the capacitor builds up slowly, and the process: i end up supplying energy to it, which we finally interpret as if its stored either in the capacitor or in the electric field that is there
that at what cost the product has been developed, say provided to the people and how the people's needs have been taken care of
and what you would realize is that say again you come forward with 16 different types of combinations and then there are words written there, idealist, guardian, rational, artisans, so these are the brought temperaments
this will be the data which will be require for calculation of the plastic section, modulus, actual plastic section, and then the bending strength of the section
prepare leisure accounts for ram and company
so it is apparent power because it seems apparent that the power should be the voltage current product which is by analogy with the dc resistive circuit
think about it ok
but one thing is true: that you have a particular present cell, lets call it p, the next cell lets call it n, and the previous cell lets call it r
when you are using that, there will not be any multiplicities involved in that surface construction, you will be having that unique representation
so, if you have a facilitator in field like along with you, then you would mostly be creating an instructor like training which is referred to as an iot, but if that is not there or they are available for a brief period of time, then you can go in for a blended learning, where in your learners have an online training for a brief period of time and then you have the facilitator on field or with them for a different period of time
we run the pipe line at the same frequency but the voltage, initially it was v ref, now it has become v ref by one point eight, three
and the other one will have only two parallel paths we talked about that
so, 135 degree is here, so this is 135 degree ok, now at 135 degree i 1 is positive, but its less than maximum
so, at every end of every term, you can renew their trademark and keep it alive
sorry, but if it is true i love him too
so, this particular problem does not ask you to calculate the depletion widths, but you can go ahead and do the calculation and you will find that the depletion width is almost entirely on the n side and that there is a very small depletion width on the p side
so, i have that object
9, 5
and line to line voltage is equal to root 3 times the phase voltage right
then it will automatically show
6 million then the same reduction has not been seen in the same proportion in the variable cost and we have seen at every level there are the variances
in these sketches and in this visual, we find that different aspects of proxemics have been communicated
let us look at some issues relating to design challenges first
in the third angle system, these views will be alternatively arranged
for example, if the libc does not have a system function, then the attack which we have discussed in this particular lecture will not function
i wrote this explicitly out here just to show that this can be integrated over, because in the integrant there is no phi
therefore, it is only this particular flaw, which is shown over here that could lead to a system being not secure
we do not know where exactly this q point is from this information
so, find out the your current through this branch, and current through this branch right
so, if you see here, if you multiply both sides by s into s plus 2 into s plus 3, so what you will get
ok, so the motivation is as follows: because of their very specific requirements, so we want to develop or formulate specialized routing algorithms
for r n, you will get your 2 ohm, r n will become your
but two and six you cannot merge because there is a constraint horizontal
one is that the oscillator uses positive feedback
so, in the next class we will learn more about other kind of things like how to draw circles on 2d sheets perhaps something like slots, straight slot how to construct it, how to construct ellipse, how to construct different kind of pentagonal kind of structures and other things
this is of course the gate, drain and the source and this is the moss in saturation region
but if we can go back here once, see this only this t device called tee, only this device does not provide matching at all ports, however it can be matched at a single port
so now let's start preparing it and first schedule that i will prepare for you is here is drawing this information and converting that into the different budget schedules will be the sales budget
like lists and other data structures, we can test membership using in
so, very beginning of linear algebra what do you say should be a condition on f for you to be able to solve this equation
so, if you remove everything out of it
i am going to change that just a little bit by a minus sign that is just the convention
so what is done in this particular function is that there is a for loop from the more significant bit in e down to 0 that is the least significant bit, and in every iteration of this for loop there is a condition check to determine whether the ith bit in e is 1 or 0
now all ciphers that we use today in practice are designed with this assumption so ciphers such as the aes, rsa, a5/3 and so on are designed with the assumption that the attacker knows the complete algorithm for encryption, decryption and can choose plain text and cipher text and the only secret is the secret key
how much of energy was required for each of this process and what came out in addition to the cement also we had emission that also has to be quantified
so here, he has saying that this function the myclass is saying that the display function which is outside of this class which is not a member function is still a friend and therefore, the private data of this class will be exposed to this member
this is 10,000 and this is again 10,000 rupees and your profit and loss account is balanced
so, if i take a point and i ask for o distance i get the distance from the origin whether or not the point is represented using x y or r theta
so this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 and similarly i am going to have 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
i conjugate means the irms value now will become irms angle instead of theta i it will become minus theta i, so we will write the complex power as vi conjugate that is vrms into irms conjugate
now, other than that, save and recall is the same function that you can save the signal, and you can recall it later
so initially, as soon as switch is turned on, there is no current, and finally, as if there's no inductor there, the current becomes e over r
this is the thing
this goes all the way down, perhaps look in the direction
now the windings will have to fit within the window area
now we are assuming that that profit is paid to the owners or to the shareholders
for me, this is amazing
48 and you round off to the highest integer, so this gives you 7
in the process of quantification we looked at different areas as per our definition
so, i start from here and a complete traversal means this
so, your whole attention span is 55 words or 160 words which come in a sms or a whatsapp or whatever
so, this is your new this is your update equation for update equation for psi
we have also noted that virtual functions could be pure and in which case they do not need to have a body and in those cases the corresponding class containing such pure virtual functions are abstract base classes
clock one was like this, it was coming
so, let us draw that
first we discuss about linearity where, if the function is like a1f1t plus a2f2t, the laplace transform of this would be a1f1s plus a2f2s
so we call this as v connection or open delta connection
where, c is the right hand operand and re as you know refers to the real component of the current object on which this method has been invoked, which has to be the left hand side operand
so, on this there are different member functions foo and foobar defined
so, holding the gaze for an unnecessarily longer period as well as darting eyes both me suggest that the person is lying
let us now look at one of the examples of constructive alignment on an e learning platform named ‘teach next’ which entails educational content for school children
the very fact that there are so many programming languages around, it is obvious that no programming language is universally better than every other
so, that is the reason we are not changing any other suffixes and this angle is 45 degrees
this is called peak factor; that means, later we will see that any any any ac voltage
in last class, we continued discussing about extrinsic semiconductors
just for completeness, the concrete masonry units are again a type of unit that you use for construction, you have different types of concrete masonry units
so, take profit after tax in the numerator and from balance sheet take total assets
around it there is another circle like this outside the, out of the circle of the field, radiant on this side also
this is the, your what you call basic understand that means
so in a typical 32 bit system you would have 8 more bytes that gets allocated, so in total for a malloc of 8 bytes internally ptmalloc would actually allocate 16 bytes, 8 for the actual data for the user data and 8 more bytes for the meta data
suppose, v is equal to v m sin omega t, right; so, in this case, this is low angle associated that it is omega t plus 0 degree right
so, what, if i know incident field in the electric if i know the incident electric field take the curl you get the magnetic field right
the first step of course, is to be aware of the negative traits which we may possess as for as our body language is concerned
this is part of the function; this is the tricky part which is how do you delete the first value
i told you that this correction factor appears only for the saturation region and not for the triode region
keep in mind normally in p&l account your incomes minus expenses the last item is profit here we start with profit and go to cash from operations add the tax expenses for the year you get net profit before tax then add non c
that is, if i have i1 and i2 flowing that way, what will be flowing out is going to be i1 plus i2
so this is actually beyond the timing algorithms or the placement algorithms
listen to this lecture as many times as you can because you have to understand what these steps are for
so, the there are a huge number of parts included in this you can see here
so, when this condition occurs, then the resonancet will start occurring
so, if you actually look at it in a transformer, between v1 and v2 dash, the phase angle will be really really small, normally, right
the next type of handshake which sometimes we come across is known as the knuckle grinder and as you can understand it is associated with very tough people who want to indicate the same type of a toughness in their attitudes
we all know sio2 etchant very easy to remember buffer hydrofluoric acid; that means, when i when i dip this wafer in the buffer h in bhf, what will happen
you began with the numeric types, which divided into two categories int and float
and i 1 is equal to 3 i 3, i 3 is equal to 1 ampere so, i 1 is equal to 3 ampere
how to control the fact of series field
the m flag set if the chunk was obtained using an mmap system call by the n flag is set if the chunk along to a thread arena
so, we show it by a dash dot kind of line
now, prims algorithm, what it does
so now the requirement is that let us construct a tree, depending on my actual problem at hand
now, theta is w is equal to tan inverse l omega minus 1 1 upon omega cr because, z is equal to r plus j it is x l minus your x c right
we will see what is the advantage in constructing this
so the we have situation one, which is our real situation, situation to which we have created, and we we know the answer
so, this is an example where the principle of coherence has been applied on rule number 2, which says that always avoid extraneous words into your content, so that your students can be able to learn better and adjust better the information that is put on that particular image
so what we have to do is similar to what we did in case of the nmos amplifiers, we have to first find the total vsd, total vsd and total id and apply these conditions
this should have been v two
what it does it compares v p and v n and if v p is higher it increases output if v p is lower it decreases output, that is what it does
there is one, there is a special case of this flexural mechanism which is if the aspect ratio of the wall and the level of, if the aspect ratio of the wall is such that the wall is still going to be dominated by flexural mechanisms
similarly if you decrease v 2 this comes to the left side and then so at this point the output is output is negative because if you are decreasing v 2 because the output is proportional to v 2 minus v 1
the shortest suffix that can be incremented consists of something followed by the longest suffix cannot be incremented
i have underlined this right
so, it means if you take this variance and you have to multiply it with something like the rate, labour mix variance and what is the rate
so, argv 1 is the series of a’s which is then passed into the main function through this second parameter argv 1
so, let us first look at the true solution, will notice in all of these calculations we use the wave equation a lot right because it is very easy to handle
so, it is given that switch has been closed for a long time and that means, this switch was closed for a long time and your i mean it was closed for a; this switch was closed for a long time
the same set of calculations are valid for horizontal bending analysis where the wall is subjected primarily to the lateral force
we didn't contact those people on time or we couldn't find out that how much are actually available, how much are required, so that is the one reason
so you have a system here which is doing the control and you could have something like a pc which is giving the function okay, so in a servo mechanical system we have an actuator that is driven by a screw, so it can go up and down, it has been pushed up and down just by using a motor to turn a screw which will push the actuator up and down
we had calculated the rent in this previous income statement
the operating point drain current also flows through rl, so operating point drain current id0 times rl
let me get back to the overview slide
now, if you differentiate the above equation with respect to time, you can simply write i by c is nothing but de naught by dt or you can write in short form as ce naught dot is equal to i
so if it is continuous valued or continuous in amplitude and is defined for continuous time then it's an analog signal more specifically it's a continuous time analog signal now what are the other types of signals it is possible that the signal is defined or signal changes only at discrete instance of time okay the discreteness of of the time axis is marked here
so, this is easier to solve and we know the solution of this differential equation is given by theta prime, which is a function of t of course, ok
we observed that there will always be at least one common factor namely 1
b dot d l, like in the previous argument, is going to be b at x and we are going again in the same direction as z
so, it means what is the cogs
so from x one there is a vertical edge with g, there is a vertical edge with c and vertical edge with a
instead, if we just take a very small, a differential element dz and represent it like this
similarly, divide this angle we have seen if we instead of approximating into half angles if we are not very careful about that we know how to divide this into two parts
so if we follow these two rules, the possible combinations for voltage and current are four
so, we had just started with understanding what is accounting, then what is a distinction between various streams of accounting like financial cost management accounting
9 newton per millimetre square and the permissible stress calculated was 189
this is the excess of time
we have seen how to; the different dynamic allocation operators, operator new and so on
so, if you go through this right just 1 minute
so this t equal to zero, t equal to one, two, three, four and so on
we basically for given the particular combination of arguments, we look up whether that combination of keys is there in the dictionary if so we look it up and return it
for example, we shake hands with others; we hold hands with other person; in certain situations there is a formal kissing also which is involved sometimes as a friendly gesture; we can back slap, we do this high five gesture shoulder pat etcetera
if you just have an op amp with say this resistance this connections are not there do not say that v p and vn will be always same ok
so, both the dc and rf will appear at this point and so we can combine the 2
now looking at this you have to now revise the standards and then you have to calculate the standard cost
now notice that when it displays my quote, it does not show triple quotes
so, all these function pointers must be of the same type; which means they must take the same type of parameters and must return the same type of value
whether the purchase department has purchased paid the higher price or despite paying the higher price they have purchased inferior quantity quality of the material of the input a
so, it is v a by 5 plus v a minus this is one equation this is one equation you will get
so this partitioning can be done at any level
the first step what one should do upon receiving the glass is you put it in a soap solution overnight step one, take the glass cover slips and put them in then take a beaker you take the glass cover slips raise the glass cover slips like this in a soap solution
so, we are moving chloride ions away from the steel towards the anode
so, of course, in compression you have more energy being absorbed before failure
and there are four debit items, opening stock, purchase, freight inward and wages
so, that is i mean because i am not showing you the derivation from griffiths it seems like where did this come from, but i mean we will assume it for now the moment you said dealing with realistic materials this relation d is equal to epsilon e is incorrect to write in the time domain, the correct relation is only in the frequency domain ok
so, it means total payments we have to assess in advance to be made in the month of january, total receipts we have to assess in advance to be received in the month of january and we have to try to find out the net balance
like, what is the state of technology with which you can develop such a system today, because tomorrow’s gadgets and devices will be quite different from what we see today
it is also critical of the low context communication because it believes that it is impolite and it does not have the ability to read between the lines and therefore, it is rather naive or may be too fast
the instructional goal of a simulation can be to explore a new topic a replace or supplement lab work a supplement to field trip or role play
so, for bias, circuit becomes a voltage follower, because when forward bias is thatere, it will be like so circuit becomes by voltage follower,
so as to summarise for narrowband filters, resonators are the fundamental entity, whereas for broadband filters, we 1st design using the traditional filter design techniques using lumped elements and then we have to find the mechanism to convert these lumped elements to their broadband to their distributed equivalent
, these are 2 islands island number 1 and island number 2
so, we are in the process of learning about the calculation of material variances and till the last class we were learning about that how to calculate different variances and the problem which we are doing now is part of the problem i did in the previous class and remaining say part of the problem i will discuss now
therefore, z t will become z plus z l; z is this one, this 2
discretizing and solving that give you phi all right
we will primarily talk about the contrast in the areas of io variables, math library standard library headers, loop and the bool type
and the pointer has a type which is of a
instead of applying this ramp across this horizontal plate, which is generated internally in the oscilloscope, we can apply a external signal across this plate as well
let me again write the same lines that i made for charge and it at rest
let me call this as eb dash right, but this has to happen at a value of 1500 rpm right
similarly the activity based costing is a technique of the cost accounting not of the management accounting but that information which is generated by these different techniques of cost accounting how to use that information for the management decision making that is a million dollar question and that is we are going to learn here
in addition, as i said, you can also add some space in between for interconnections, which means you need to know how much space is required or what is the complexity of the interconnections, right
so, in this case also, if you your what you call that this is the your what you call this is the direction of the your what you call direction of the flux right, and this is your n turn
so, here i have no choice, i have to live with the singularities
so, i have got x equivalent and r equivalent of my transformer windings, which will account for the series parameters in the equivalent circuit
so, question is that your for example, this one look for a first i am taking ra; ra right what we are doing in that is your r 1 r 2 this numerator is common r 1 r 2 plus your r 2 r 3 plus r 3 r 1 common divided by this is ra right
t2 would need 30 milliseconds and t1 is its higher priority task
so, if it says that we are returning the reference of the return expression
today internet is available for not even rupees but pesos
for example, the engineering way of looking at rocket is completely different from artistic way of representing drawing
of course you have to keep some information about the obstacles in your data structure, that these are the places where some obstacles are there
so, n into e is defined
so you have a walk through you know how no, where to enter how to move, how does the corridor move ahead, what leads to where and so forth
3 is a mathematical forms of form of ohm’s law
now when you are talking about the loss here so in this case when we are knowing now that the power board generating company generated this much number of units, 90,000 were passed down to the transmission company it means we know at this level we lost 10,000
so the first clue that i am going to give you is, so let’s say a customer survey group went and found out that hey it is white, so what are your ideas for
now, you have the generating will generate power, but you have to control the how to call output generating power
in the code we go up to value of 27 and that's the value here and you see that the stress reduction factors are of the order of 0
so, if you understand the new knowledge as a basic knowledge that has to be some applied research that needs to be done for converting the basic knowledge into products and services
so, now i have value of r l i have found it
a typical use of string processing for a file is when we take something like a spread sheet and export it as text
and, in next class, we will look at these four methods especially focus directrix method, rectangle method and there is a special case like tangent method to construct parabolas and how to draw tangent and normal to parabolas also we will see
in case of the purchase budget, again, same thing we will do
so now let us move on to see how we are going to mount to the specimen onto the testing frame
so, it is here self plating rules remember told you that this you have to be very careful, how much cells you are plating
in a pair programming, each desktop is manned by two programmers
if the total actual time of the labor differs from the total standard time of the labor, it means what was the standard time decided was that is not missed with regard to the actual
so, we look back over here one case its going up and the other case is going down right
it is not just one base class, it inherits all data members of all base classes and it may add new data members
1 and it goes to 0 right
so x is selected
it bears a design number, the date of registration of that design is given
either way is possible
and, i will just minimize this to show you that a destructors have been called and they destroy the two objects
65 meter right, for unequal support sag at lower level can be calculated using equation 58
but it is clearly mentioned here that in this way you cannot implement nested subroutine call or recursion, which is so common; you see here you have only one register to store the return address r14
so, now concern tissues are sitting out here, the oxygenated blood or the red blood cells travel here and unload their oxygen, is oxygen is taken up by the tissues and the veins out here takes up the co2 which is given away by these cells this is brought back via heart goes to the lungs and from the lungs any picks up the oxygen throw away the carbon dioxide picks up the o2, throw away the co2 and it oxygen further comes back after attaching the hemoglobin
once we do that, we will get a perpendicular line passing through point k; let us look at that
so i should assume that maybe it is a pm motor or at least in this particular case shunt winding i have to connect it to a separate power supply, right
so, when i have the input voltage, which is less, right instead of just a sine viewwave, if input voltage which is is varying in nature which is varying in nature like you see, this is my input voltage
this is expanded here, this portion here you can see that the changes only up to 350 over here it is about 350
and now if i change theta to be something else, so if i take theta to be something like 10 degree or so, then i will have a delay of 10 degree maybe like this
here we have modulus of z where is a its frequency
of the total sales, these are the total sales for the month of march, 40% of the collection is of how much, 38,000s
so, this is only we have talked about general lightning stroke, but we have not talked about; when it is lightning stroke happen on the overhead transmission line or in direct or indirect stroke
having calculated variety of ratios of profitability, return as well as the activity, let us have a look at expense ratios
the first module i can use as a power down mode
let's say the task one runs three times in the major cycle
so, therefore, this shunt capacitor has the same effect as an overexcited synchronous condenser, generator or motor right; effect is similar
we are given here are given here weeks will remain 30 workers are 45 and the rate is 40 right so how much it is going to be is going to be something like say this 45 that is the rate is how much 40 and weeks are again going to be 30 so how much this cost is going to be this cost is going to be 54,000s
no but
if ia is increasing, i am going to have less value of e b although the difference is not much still i am going to have a little bit less value of e b
now the challenge in operating activities was it can be by direct method
so what happens when you plug in your appliance in the house
because the thickness of the film is extremely small
so the polling server was getting this slot for execution, but towards the end of it just before it completes the sporadic task occurred
what we will going to see is something like a red one
so you calculate net profit before tax, net profit after tax, and that net profit after tax, which we calculate in the profit and loss account with the help of financial accounting that is called as a divisible profit
the group cannot see the observer, the psychologist but the observer psychologist can see the group
we will apply kvl around the left hand loop so this is the left hand loop
94 kilowatt, right
of course, this is not only switching on and off bulb, there could be many more things that could be done
suppose you have connected capacitor, this is say j q l and this is your sending end node; this is your receiving end node
can you think of any examples of liability
so, over here i can say epsilon r make it lossy exactly epsilon r will become complex
now, between the two methods, which method is better in your opinion
your input voltage will swing from place to place from 180 degrees to 180 volts to 270 volts
and here the project manager monitors and controls each stage
also considering the fact that we know that strengths in one direction versus the other direction is going to be different in masonry
so, today we have finished our discussion of proxemics, you would find that many aspects which we have discussed in the last two modules would be taken over again when we will look at different other aspects of non verbal communication
subtract the delay of these lines, subtract the delay of this gate, so what r a t value will be getting here will be the minimum of these
because, that is an idea of a murder being solved by an investigator was that is protected then there cannot be any further murder mystery novels in that genres
can you think of situations where you would need to use on screen text to support graphics instead of an audio
so, it becomes an expense item for us
the masonry wall is constructed with a single stack of bricks
so, if i say d then if i say slash then the meaning of this slash is a division of floating point numbers
if you see this led, you can make out that one of its legs is longer, and another is shorter
this inter pole you are what you call about this commutating poles other things you will not study for this course you will study in your second year or third year electrical machine course
these are the hybrid kind of parameters which we have in case of h parameters
if you if you have seen this diagram if you have just just hold on from that i will i will make it for you just hold on right
so it is very important to follow this all the steps of life cycle assessment
so, if you now apply kcl at node a so, i 0 is equal to right, this i right is equal to this i this this is a entering this current is leaving and plus 1 by 6 because this voltage is v 0 by 6, because 6 ohm resistance; so, plus your 1 by 6
because f 2 is equal to except, so it is f 2 is equal to 100 by 60 because it is making 100 cycles per minute, so 100 by 60 cycles per second divided by 50
so, that is the reason i ask you is it that
so, this is a basic way you define namespaces and you use namespaces
so here what you can do
so, it is the stuff is happening in the near field we are able to transform more power
many of the domains which are already aligned, they will not try to come back from their position because already aligned you have done from work on them
so, to start with let us see what is op amp and what are its characteristics right
so, we said e2 and v2 will be equal to each other if it is ideal transformer
so, this is the starting resistance, which i include only during starting and i am going to essentially apply the full voltage
so, you might have a load bearing masonry wall which is 230, 200, 200, 230 or even larger, your tie column is typically limited in dimension
let us look at that
the expression for the drain current at some operating point we will see what they are
p 1 differencing with p0, and p 2 differencing with p0
so, the total field appeared at gamma
the potential is there because this q gives a negative image, charge here q prime, and that attracts it
so, v 3 actually is equal to 12 i 3
this we have seen before is nothing but gph x τ, the value of τ is also given, so τ is 10 microseconds
sometimes it may be possible that in order to think about something or in order to organize our ideas we look away as in exhibition of an invert thought for a couple of seconds and this is perfectly all right
so since we already discussed about the solution and what the solution, what the features in the solution has to be, we have come up with some basic assumptions what we are thinking or still happening in the current situation in a classroom
and, it can be used not only to influence other people, but it can also be used to influence and reshape our own attitudes
so, it will be q l 4 minus q c 4 right plus your q l 5 plus q l 6
the other example which almost connect to depression is anxiety
so, by simply checking if p b is null or not you know whether the dynamic cast has gone through or whether actually the pointed object is a b type object or not, so that is a basic value of the dynamic cast
diffusion for n type diffusion is green, p type diffusion in brown metal, one blue metal, two purple, and the vias, the connections, contact, represent black
61 degree right, because it is if, you take it is this thing it is r plus j l omega right, this is the impedance of that your inductor
and there also we said that personal significance plays a very important role, now that emotions which is likely to have no more of a personal significance
so, we can draw a simplified picture of this
so this is means if we do not consider the high shear, then this is the bending moment, means bending strength
so if i say boolean difference is del, f, del, some input variables, x
now this cannot be followed for every circuit, especially when you have ac voltages, alternating quantities, but at least for the operating point as you go from bottom to top, the voltages will increase
it is very clear that the source of signal of interest that cannot be the only source that is applied to the circuit because then what you get out of the network will definitely be less than what you put in
you take the answer about whether 2 divides n or not, and reverse it to get the answer odd
97 this is the efficiency, so this will be the input power
so, what terms get cancelled, the exponential gets cancelled there is any alpha get cancelled, what is the most convenient power of alpha to cancel from both the left and right side
so, example another example you take the three phase balanced load in figure 29 has your z star is equal to 8 plus j 6 ohm
2d divergence
so, the speed of the words has to be measured, it should neither be too fast nor too slow
the next one is rheology because you want to have this thing flowing through a space right because you want to flow this through dense reinforcement i need to control the rheology
so, minus 40 plus v 1 minus v 2 is equal to 0
so, what is the forward wave look like
so between these two wires there is a high capacitance
so instead it flows in this path through the capacitor load and diode back
if you have really understood all these items, you can easily write down the final answer
so, it is 170 kilowatt hour
this is another pedagogical strategy that will help us realize what were the challenges that, the class faced and go on with it
92, so theta 2 is 23
the intellectual property rights that is patents, they protect the intellectual property that is invention
ok, so at first, look, you may say that well, this looks better, the wire lengths are shorter
secondly, the total net length is estimated as the half parameter
number of boxes, you have already estimated sixteen thousand approximately
here i have put down the small signal picture of the source follower that we originally synthesized and the complete circuit diagram that we got by trying to combine this with a suitable biasing arrangement
so, this term that is why when you are computing know 2 term a j j d j j 1 was negative another was your what you call magnitude wise a j j d j j were very close to that, here also it is logic is same, right
so, at any point a some tangential velocity will be there
so, these are the two commonly used circuits based on the specific conditions in the analysis of circuit
the objective of this search is to ensure that the invention as it is covered in a patent application has not been anticipated
so, we can say that the thevenin theorem and norton's theorem are dual to each other you can simply use the source transformation and convert them into the from norton's to thevenin and thevenin's to norton equivalent circuits
the third thing that to fall within the definition of a business, this exchange or this interaction of the thing the interaction of the thing, has to be for a value which means money passes hands, or the exchange is itself of valuable goods
so what you can do is that we can put these equations into a script file so that when you want to do an iterative design you keep changing the specification and then you keep checking things out and probably you may not get a particular component and then you may want to change few things
now, for maximum power transfer theorem d p upon d r l is equal to 0 right
the tendency to view this attitude from a monochronic perspective is to view them as basically chaotic or random
so, the design guidelines given consider the fact that simplification is necessary so that we err on the conservative side because critical sections may not necessarily happen at the base of the wall, but in such a situation it should happen at about 60% of the height of the wall
so, if you if you try to simplify it will be your what you call this is your ah this side will be your, ah this is minus delta f and this is your what you call u it is minus u and this is your ah delta e
and because they oppose each other completely literally the armature flux tends to kill the main flux
so, when you see this particular segment the value which you get from here is actually the value of i dot, so you can simply write s into i s here
so, we first initialize our list that we are going to produce for the empty list
so, this is the 30 h this point onwards the program will be loaded
first you make it like this v 2 plus this one is i 2 r e 2 cos phi 2 because this angle is marked here phi 2 right and this going like this
little bit you do, little bit practice is required initially right
now, you see here, he is changing the frequency, right
so these two are going to decide the value of r and the power dissipation is determined only by frequency and the inductance and magnetizing current components
but if you force me that you cannot go anywhere just go to see after this see, i may not even relate to them, because they are not understood
in the main function, while means this will be repeated
6 ampere
so, dλdt hc2eg degdt
look ah ah just before going to that solution, so this is we have to find out voc
in the next module we shall cover 3 port devices, thank you
and this other line green one, this we shall be using in the next experiment, this will be using the opto coupler output
and therefore, the force becomes sigma q upon 2 pi epsilon 0 and that is the answer
so, now this is the wave traveling before arrival at the junction this is the voltage wave traveling along this direction right
there is a difference of one vgs between them but it does follow the variations of the gate voltage
so, that is the only slight difference
so, this is going to induce a current over here and that current i can take it and drop it across the resistor calculate the voltage and basically get this thing right
so, this side should be r x equal to 0 in bracket i write desirable ok
now, question is that this limit we have put minus infinity and we are writing actually v t 0 as that 1 upon c t 0 t i dt plus b t 0
you have to simply short circuit the voltage source and apply the current source
this is the way the isometric thing really looks like
there is no change in equity capital, so zero change
you can be offline for a while, for a short while, but by and large it assumes that both are online, it assumes that both are really online
so, you have to have a spot where you will be putting the osmometer ok
an isothermal calorimetry looks at the heat evolution from a hydrating sample
p values will be like this: p will be similarly p a, p, b, zero four
this is the x, y plane and here is the point where we want to find the magnetic field
if you really don't know, please don't keep quiet, ask them on the discussion forum
and though we have been using primarily and our discussion, we have been talking about c++ 99 which is a 17 year old standard which was a marginally revised in c++ 03, which means the 2003 standard
both are still making that 0 degrees or 180 degrees kind of thing the equal division which comprises of same line
there are some issues also because every software has its own merits and also demerits
ok, so in the digital design process we are not only looking at the increased sizes of this circuits but also the associated complexity involved
these are the monies of the shareholders like share capital or preference share capital that will be shown and what are the borrowings
how do you do this histogram plot
payrolls depend on the wages, salaries, commission terms and payroll dates
the transmitted pulse would have moved only ten centimeters, the front end would have moved only ten centimeters and its width is going to be point six, seven centimeters and height is four millimeters
this information the firm has generated that over this three months period of time we can sell or there is a possibility of selling worth of the 1
there are a number statistics for describing such a system the simplest statistics is called the boltzmann statistic
1 divided by 2
5454 minus 0
so, it will be 4 upon 4 is equal to one ampere right this is one ampere now
polarization density is nothing but dipole moment, which is charge coulomb times distance, l per unit volume
right so; now we will come to how do you choose variables ok
let us see that xt is nothing but 4 into e to the power minus t ht is five multiplied by e to the power minus 2t and when we apply the above property the convolution of h and x is nothing but inverse laplace transform of hs into xs
so, i 2 dash is compute 40 ampere and it is 0
third is the current which is flowing in this direction
so, it is always recommended to come out of sketch mode, then save the drawing, and later you you you can reopen it
so, for a changed value of vs, we had to solve the nonlinear equation all over again
now memory distortion basically the change in the content of the recall, okay
so when we construct a derived class object will have an instance of the base 1 object which one class will have instance of the base 2 class and will have whatever data members we have added in the derived
in that geometric constructions, the first of all essential parts are how to bisect a line
it is a fundamental parameter to be considered, because we have to remove this noise to obtain the pure signal right
now, if you see omega less than equal to omega less than omega 0 that is my b l greater than b c
now, while according to the c program this is a correct thing do, but we feel somewhat uncomfortable because we wanted to remain in the domain of the enum that we have defined
in that case we really mention how many circles are present and along which main circle they were placed
in this lecture, i will be discussing about the design of a home automation system
now this explanation, this statement will be placed before the decision making committee of the top management and in the board meeting of the company this statement will be discussed and there the suggestive actions or preventive actions will be taken will be suggested by the board and next time when the budgets are prepared every caution is taken and when the actual performance comes so that maybe the comparison between the budgeted and the actual for the future period do not create this kind of the situation and no variances are found out or the minimum variances are found out which are within the control or within the permissible limit
now, what is this concept of a resonance
if, the person is heavier he will need smaller time and vice versa ok
now, if you see this particular figure if you see the thevenin equivalent what will happen to the thevenin equivalent will be 10 volt plus minus in series with 5 ohm resistance
extend this 5 also this point
yyou have a high pass filter, you have amplification, you have a low pass filter, you have the output and then you can usinge this particular block,
so, we start with profit before tax and we make adjustments for those items which are non cash in nature
let me tell you what my experiences with the head tilt are; i was looking for an alternative for the listeners nod, using it perpetually makes one look like a bobble head and after approximately one year of head tilting and noticed mainly two reactions
so, complete response is equal to natural response that is stored energy, that is your source the circuit that is the natural response we got plus forced, that is independent source may be voltage source or current source independent source, right
but, what happens within this is if you have a client who is later going to come back and say no you know i wanted to change something there, you go back to step 2 and go change it
in c++ we have both
remember last time when we were discussing the pwm block we said that this triangle within the pwm block is transiting from minus 1 to plus 1
so, let us take the up case first
now you have to arrange these sources from where the funds will come
however, concerns have been raised particularly about the classroom situations, where it was felt that the traditional ways of receiving of feedback about the behaviour of the students through eye contact, proxemics, voice differences etcetera; if absent may be detrimental to their development
so, i have axial deformations, i have lateral deformations, i can estimate both models of elasticity and the poisons ratio in situ
i have already talked to you but just let us go through what is written here
for example, construction of a large building
so it will not be a unique answer arbitrarily
so, let us take an example of non inverting opamp all right
so vgs to carry a current of i0 is the threshold voltage vt plus square root of 2 times i0 by mun, ciox, w y, so the source voltage here is this fixed voltage vg 0 at the gate minus vgs which is vg 0 minus vt minus square root 2
the assurance that the insulation provided will withstand all normal operating stresses, and the majority of abnormal ones; that means, whatever insulation you make that it will withstand the normal operating stresses right
that an object may be considered to have five different execution stages because first for the object to exist there has to be a memory, which has to get allocated somehow, either on the stack automatically or in the global common area statically or in the heap dynamically
so let us first explain what is a matching, in case you have
so, this if you consider this as the as one of the limiting cases, one of the first limiting cases, we are interested in knowing what wind pressure acting on the wall under the condition of the wall being loaded in gravity by itself weight or any superimposed load at what wind pressure would you reach this limiting triangular distribution of stresses
now to calculate npat we started with retained earnings, add interim dividend, add taxes provided, we got npbt, then depreciation and discount and debentures was added
it will check that i am using namespace name 1
then when we are valuing finished goods inventory, we will take 20 plus 1 that is 21 plus 5
the feedback network beta decides the feedback to the to the given to the input
so, the field at some vector r is going to be 1 over 4 pi epsilon 0 q the positive charge gives me the field q, r minus a in the z direction
now the operation of this class a amplifier is like this
the annual turnover is over us dollar 15 billion and employees around 20,000 people
so, you call this solver dot h; you call this solver dot c
to get over this problem, somewhat there is another type of image filters called m derived filters
unlike lm35 this is not a linear device; the resistance is not proportional to the intensity level, it follows this kind of exponential curve
so on the average this runs much faster
so, we split this into two equal parts through this cut sectional plane, keep the left part, try to visualize how it looks like and remove the right side part
so rotor is going to have slots in the external periphery like this
the issue arrives when i want to actually look at calling something like p pointer g, that is i am a calling virtual function and i am using a pointer so this is where i need the dynamic binding
so you get another forward path gain that is g1s into g2s into g3s into g4s into g6s into g7s
only we will be in a position to see a if we are having a shining light on to that object
so, one answer is that it will be the integral will be r dependent it should not be r dependent what is the catch
so, in that case your ah what you call this all the steady state values x 1 s s x 2 s s everything you everything will get ah i mean all the seven state variables whatever i have shown right all this ah your this thing your ah steady state values you will get
and it compares the revenues and the cost, the net result is given to you in the form of profit or loss
so, force casting is a dangerous thing
so, that is why i am squeezing down the time in 20, 25, 30, half an hour whatever the lectures i can bring it to whatever modules i can bring it to so that you have enough time to understand, and then digest and then solve more
suppose we want to we want this edge to stick on this particular edge
what is happening now
in comparison to a person who has spent a life time in sparsely populated place and those people who are from less populated places tend to use a higher volume
under this condition vo equals to vin or av equals to unity
the vehicle is out of the way and now she is happy to go to work
now we can also say that i want the thing left justified in this not a center
otherwise, it is fine
this is just to illustrate that if we pass a parameter, through a parameter a value that is mutable it can get updated in function and this is sometimes called a side effect
people are automatically drawn towards people who have a positive eye contact because it conveys self assurance and confidence
now, if you apply step voltage to the circuit; you can represent that phenomena with the help of this function
now what is sufficiently small is very dependent on the nonlinear element you have and so on the only definition i can give is that it should be small enough so that second order and higher order terms should be negligible
is that variant we just 1 inside and s 2 outside
gamma dash but, i do not see it in the equation so far
this plot shows the axial force and displacement behaviour for the prestressing strand
so we would cover the multiple inheritance at a top level, and we will live some of the final issues as exercised to you all
so, you have a minimum between the 2 atoms and then you have a maximum at the 2 nucleus
on the other hand, if we execute this statement, then because this is an immutable value the change in v inside the function does not affect z at all
5 susceptance
so this is the kind of mmf or flux we are going to look at a particular omega t at a particular omega t
so, v means first you remove this one
the simplest point in space i
so, net output is 25 h p 1 horse power is equal to 746 watt
k b is also in joules, so it is your boltzmann constant that has a standard value
so, safer and more effective and more reliable systems through improved understanding of users requirement is something that applied experimental psychologist and engineering psychologists concentrate on
the problem is that this part of the small resistance contributed by the connection it is getting added to this low resistance
so, let us prepare this schedule and learn about that how we are going to take care of all these things
this is also because of the shunt capacitors effect; release capacity of feeder because it will draw that because of shunt capacitor that feeder will draw less amount of current we will come to that also
in the previous case we saw the simple single output system
then towards the end we will show you some nomograms on estimating service life at the very early stages of design phase
similarly, some benefits they can be identified but not they can be easily quantified
so, that is about the ways of solving ax is equal to b
you can see where we have put an xor gate between every pair of flip flops
so, derivative is nothing but a measure of the difference between the current measure and the previous measure, you continuously sense the output variable, you saw that last time the temperature was let us say 21 now it is 23
so, this is line to line voltage, and this is your line to neutral we call phase voltage
i am looking at the scan mode
this is more suitable for area or grid routing
order del q right
thank you we will be
but what is different is the way the memory is allocated
so, what is the distance
therefore y 1 is equal to your 1 upon z that is coming 0
so, that is x is equal to x1 minus x2
in fact, that is what we do in the case of the tm polarization
and it's a current source
so, this becomes t 1 over t 2 whole to the power 3 over 2 exponential minus e g over 2 k 1 over t 1 minus 1 over t 2
so it means collection from the sales is dollar 47,200s
the fourth one which is a shaded pole motor
so, we will talk about the history of this field which comes under the overview right
so, to begin with any software, we use that to design and draft the things especially we use computers to use in designing objects that kind of process what we call computer aided design
this is also we have studied in detail, right in lecture notes that, these are the 2 golden rules that we have to remember
the starting current could be very very large in any dc motor for that matter when i am starting it with full voltage
so, capacitor thing is over good assignment problem will be given to you right and your job is to solve those things have patience and you have to solve those things right
let us summarize and list the design steps for the transformer
so, both the parts are brought together in a single assembly drawing
and many of these things will change but ultimately if one thinks that the developmental needs of places like india, of africa which are the continents that are rising at the moment, this is the material that is going to have to take us through the next certainly several decades
54 above e v, e f i which is the fermi energy is located very close to the center of the band
so, generally it is not a good idea you know to choose a wire whose thickness is less than what you anticipate at the current limit
so, what you can do is you just ah if i if i make it like this before this thing, so this is this is one loop this is another loop you can take right and if this current is i 1 this current is i 2 right
5 v0 is equal to v in minus v in and at d tending to 1 or let us say greater than 0 5 at v0 duty cycle greater than 0
the slope of a resistor's iv characteristic is 1 by r everywhere
in some cases we find that it is also associated with a sense of authority, when a person holding a superior position can indicate other people with a finger, without associating the finger pointer with any sense of insult
when there is lateral action due to deformation of the frame you will have interaction between the panel, the infill panel which is conceived as a non structural element and the moment resisting frame which is conceived as the lateral load assisting element
so, if you look into try to trace for d1, will see the same symmetric behavior and i would leave it to you to complete
15 kilo newton so so strength of the bolt will become the smaller of this two one is strength in sharing and strength in bearing and smaller of these two we could find as 45
but usually for this problem this bottom up approach gives better result than the top down approach
another countermeasure is by fuzzing clocks so that the attacker will not be able to make precise timing measurement
so, the advantage of of this p spspice is that, you do not really require the equipment that we are showing it to you here;
so, if you see the value of current i 1 if you if you use kirchhoff’s current law in the left side of the circuit, so i 1 will be since v 1 is applying across y 11, it will become v 1 into y 11 plus so this will be the value of current flowing through this and the value of current flowing through this is y 12 v 2
but we are doing it so slowly that the transients are not so visible
it should be a circle; of course i am showing it in different way
so if i have an and gate, let say its a three input and gate
i will charge you the interest or load my credit sales with the 1% per month interest it means 12% i will charge
by the way, let me put the values i had before already we took it to be 100 kilo ooms
so, i am trying to recollect certain words and then the gaze moves in this direction
hello and welcome again
whether he is connected to the wholesaler or retailer or the direct customer means there are the three levels minimum three levels
so, it is not only the sale, the people have to be dependent on the sale steel only
he is studying at a university in delhi, india
now, typically radars, they send a single frequency wave right its sending a single frequency, let us say our air traffic control radar
which whole equation
so, we started at low temperature where we said that we will ignore all the electrons coming from the valence band, we found out that as we started going above 0 kelvin, electrons are going to get ionized from the donor levels till we reach a saturation temperature when all most all the donors are ionized
finally the feedback is often clubbed with constraints, why because the moment the user decides to click on something, the system should tell them about the clickable and non clickable options also in order to avoid unnecessary clicks and navigation ideas
the current what i am talking about in the armature circuit it will be almost in phase if i am talking about a resistive load
and what are their properties
he did not opt for it
if you go further yeah if you go further what we see typical performance characteristics right output resistance versus frequency, then we see input resistance versus input capacitance versus frequency
i do not really have anything that you can probably help me with’
so, which one is more profitable, which one is less profitable
notice that in nexus equation we assume that divergence of e integrated over surface is equal to q over epsilon zero, which is gauss's law
ip could most likely be within publications as well
so omega 1 plus omega 2 will be a very very high frequency so i will not be able to see actually the intensity increasing and decreasing at all but omega 1 minus omega 2 i would be able to observe with my naked eye
if you solve this to get a value of minus 13
6 is the ionization energy for the hydrogen atom this value is in electron volts m e star over m e is nothing, but the electron effective mass
so will take a small example of what a side channel attack is in a very abstract way, a side channel not only targets the algorithm that is used for encryption or decryption but also targets the implementation of that particular algorithm
now let us calculate some of the combined ratios
available to the firm would be 5 rupees per kage, good quality potato but and that is called as normal cost
the other end of the bulb is connected to the ac source
so, that it becomes tangent to this arc
i am going to use 2 watt meter method clearly
so, we can see that this is a nice one dimensional function in x and y
depreciation is also more or less constant
so, for position 1 we have r m alone and 1 2 3 together so, these 2 are the 2 parts ok
so, sudden closing of s 2 does not affect the inductor current, because the current cannot change abruptly through the inductor
if i take the product, it means i am saying that this is the probability that the logic value of the node will be at one and also will be at zero, which means there is a transition
previous one that it was in area one that is why it was divided by your p r 1 both side
i am applying a constant voltage on the vdd and ground lines, so i should as ensured that whatever current is drawn by the circuits which i am driving my power lines or tracks should be, should be wide enough to drive the required power
where you are using the operational amplifier
in terms of inability to recall information from long term if you consider no reasons for information loss in sensory memory decay of trace has been considered as important reason why information is lost
perhaps, there is a perception that the one is faster than the other, but the actual correctness of the implementation should not be affected by how you choose to represent the data
so actual production has been or the productive time has been 1 880 labor hours
so separation means that you have a different you know you have a separate dc supply, you have a separate rf supply and they are the both the two networks are not interfering with each other and that is achieved by this bias network
i showed and this is the loss expression, the general expression and this is actually your electrical equivalent of branch jj for any radial distribution get one
so, if i increase the value of b keeping a and c unchanged, then at some point b will be equal to b square will be equal to 4 ac
so, let us stop here
so let us say i will position the average somewhere here
so, often the rights are in the hands of controlling shareholder groups
the answer is as follows
so, i think you must be clear by now with the concept of the statement of the cost for the cost sheet
so, this current is given and this is equal to 0
and we know that because we can do experiments like this
this is a digitalin type of input
so, hopefully it is matching with whatever is the kva rating even in the primary side, right
between the lambda axis and this was you know your field energy
so even with that, ah, rough estimate, we can say that well, my critical net is becoming too long
what is criteria
then it becomes like a sorted list and every insert will take order n time, but if we do have rotations built in as we do, we could be using an avl tree then we can ensure that the tree never grows to height more than log n
but, we assume that this capacitor initially was charge at v 0
so the traditional kcl and kcl that we often use for solving network problems at low frequency or dc are no longer applicable when we come to the microwave range of signals
so, what the system function does is that it forks a process and then executes that particular process, so essentially the child of this one process is the shell that we have just created
it is equally important in our professional settings but it should come with certain moderators and we should be aware of certain filters before either extending our touch to other human beings or before looking at a particular interpretation of the touch of another human being
for example, if we are using a0 sheet, then the drawing board size supposed to be larger than that 1500 mm by 1000 mm width, thickness supposed to be 25 millimeters
so imagine of fluid or heat or some particles flowing all rights
for inverting amplifier, iit will be minus r 2 by r 1 or minus rrf by rin
so, another advantage is that this w i what you can do is, you can pre compute and keep it you can store it as a table you do not have to solve it when you are actually when you are given a integral, it is not that that time you should start to compute w i you can pre compute and keep it
so, in in in that case whatever value you will get right, so ah this is a delta connection, so why line to line voltage this point means this point this point mean this point
the quiescent current here is of course 200 microamperors
similarly then how to say take decision about the different other aspects like inventory then like say credit sales and say serving the different kind of the needs of the customers spread over the diverse markets all around the globe
so if this has to be approximately 1, then we need rg plus 1 by gm 0 much more than rs, or in other words, rg must be basically much more than rs
aand then for implementing this peak detector, we will take the circuit which is shown here which is shown here and we will also implement on the on ththe mmultisim same multi same so, that so you guys understand how it is different from when you are using breadboard and how it is different when we are using multi same
so, again in this case also you have got the variances like 2 are adverse, 1 is favorable
we were looking at delta sigma y
so, there are the different types of the cost cost can be classified under different names and the different say nomenclature
in tata group, you know rattan tata is chairman of all tata group companies but is not ceo of any company
if m1 is lesser than m2, both m1 and m2 have terms related to the 1st stage and the 2nd stage respectively
so this will allow us to only find the line current then we have to use our recent discussion that phase currents are obtained by the line current is root 3 times of phase current
there is no direction i mean i am assuming e i mean it is along a line
already we know this point p1 locate it on the sheet
what i want to do is to add this bias to that signal
do not get confused with this syntax, what is being said
you can see, here also we have some blocks which are very nicely placed but you cannot slice them
if division signals are coming, then you cannot allow these cells
similarly if you now change v 1 this curve is not going to change, but this curve is going to change; why
if that is the case wwe will put the value of c m c m which is 2 picofarad and ccee is 0
i have not written vgs minus vt in terms of id alone
and that point we are not yet done because we want to convert this whole thing into the magnetic field
so, we have already discussed this particular point
so, what will we do
now this, the, this equation of four, unknowns four equation
this is again a very important information and worth taking into a consideration while preparing the cash budget
also the paging related aspects such as eviction of a page, loading of a page all done as part of the privileged instructions
let say, let say i have circuit like this: there are two outputs
so, in this case, we have angular symmetry which means that the what is the physical significance of angular symmetry is that whatever function or output i get will not have any theta dependence right; so no theta dependence
in practice, typically to prevent duplication, all programs that are running in a machine would use the same copy of the shared library
now, if you try to find out that v thevenin and r thevenin, then this circuit you are represented like this is linear 2 terminal circuit
return on capital is equal to we have been given profit after tax, add taxes or we could have also taken pbt directly and to this we can add interest or the finance cost divided by in the denominator we are going to take total long term capital so we will take again put it in bracket net worth so it got close net worth plus so net worth plus long term debt
how you can use probes
rest of the implementation and this application is no different from earlier
so, the base constructor becomes kind of a member function in the derive class constructor, in the derive class
a filter is that all the frequencies below f c it will reject while above f c it will pass
what we are saying is that if we start with the original list of say elements 0 to 14, then the numbers 7 to 14 already satisfy the heap property
now, there is a likelihood that few of our customers don't pay their dues on time and eventually they don't pay at all
so, looking at views also one should really practice how the object really looks like in isometric way
we are looking at, is this distracted child i mean he is not just one of them, there are probably many of them but this guy clearly is distracted
so, one of the sort of basic principles in fdtd is that once i get the once i make this grid i am going to evolve the field in space and time
for this problem that power balance balance equation you will obtain and see that your what you call that your hm ah power supplied is equal to power observed, right
so, what is that lack, how fast my op amp output can track the input right, so that will be by slew rate as i will show you the slew rate also later on
now with the data what we did is when we open the specimens autopsy then we took the chloride of, determined the amount of chloride at the rebar surface or in the motor adjacent to the rebar and then use that number as at because the chloride threshold has to be at least sorry it has to be lower than this 0
for example if i look at the dc machine generally it is a cylindrical structure the stator as well as the rotor will have fairly a cylindrical structure so in which case i am not going to get these two
so plane waves and harmonic, harmono, chromatic or free moving frequency, omega waves, and see what is the energy contained of this waves, how much energy do they carry, and this waves and how much momentum flow and how much momentum to they contain remember this are the quantity we have had already calculated, for electro static field also would be given also focus on that
we need to; we can afford to do that is because we can actually read of the answer once we have got the lengths
so this is how this two step manufacturing works
so here are my post it notes for you
so, everything has a cost and that is the direct cost in terms of the money we have to pay this cost and when we have to pay this cost
so we are going to prepare this we are going to find out the labor cost variance and for that we are going to prepare the statement
so it means it is very clear that the third formula will be used, third case will be used and what is the third case
the limitation of correlation research of course is the fact that it does not permit you to draw the conclusion regarding the cause and effect relationship whether this did lead to that or not that you cannot predict
this is the indian way of doing it we claim and the claim number 1
so, that is why i did not contribute now i have switched to the integral over element b first variable what will it be
earlier it was not possible before 1991 or especially before the monitory policy of 96, 97 these uhhh institutions per not allow to invest into the short term requirements of the firms, manufacturing sector firms
for unit area of the head joint versus unit area of the bed joint the head joint, the head joint is weaker and that's the right answer is that the bed joint is consolidated by the weight of the construction itself
so, those are some of the challenges right
keep in mind that it is interesting to study manufacturing because you get debt plus equity and we have discussed about capital structure
we got 100 by 40 plus 6 by 6 into 60 upon 6 whatever come is milliampere right
so, what is the nice property of square integrable signals
so, in that case your e b 1 will be 230 volt, from figure b e b 2 will be 230 minus 10 into i a 2, because 10 ohm resistance is added
and you ask questions like are the materials addressing the learning objectives, is the subject content accurate and again we do a formative evaluation
asset on 31 december 2004 and liabilities on 31st december 2004, if you see the level of inventory given here is, that is 39050 worth of dollars inventory which is very high so they don't want to keep this much amount of inventory in the time to come so the finally the inventory level they want to bring it down from this about 40,000 to 6,000 dollars so till then no purchases will take place right merchandise cost average $4 per kite means cost of production is just 50% of the selling price
but we have this amount of $63,470 which we can utilize for making the payment of the balance of the loan
let us say, we are k t above the fermi energy
it will keep going this wave will keep going because this boundary does not actually exist, but mathematically when i end my boundary over here what will happen
606 and p by 3d0 minus 0
so, basically it is equal i 1
ok, now this clusters will be such that the once which are more heavily connected, yuo are trying to keep them together
and in this class of schedulers, the static priority schedulers, the rate monotonic algorithm is the optimal static priority scheduling algorithm
so the common practice would be that she would have her notes prepared, give the notes to one particular student in the class, probably the prefect of the class
so, ultimately torque is proportional to your phi into i a both your phi into i a; that means, in generally torque is proportional to product of field current and the armature current
so, it will be constant into constant it is written like constant because k is constant 2 is constant v g s minus vt; vt is constant
so, it has a same area right
now look at the phase angle between this and the current
we are again sorting the same data; we are again sorting in the same order
534 square minus lambda is 0
and this sae2will become s, se1 this is 1 is to 1
so, now it will field repulsion
and you can see that in the bluetooth this red led is blinking, meaning that it is ready for connection, but the device has not connected yet
you mean the for example, if i call this edge a and edge b and edge c
so, it means then your fixed expenses will also be going up and will be adding further
as you can see alpha is 0 in the past one, alpha always represents attenuation, hence this is the past band of omega lesser than omega c, where as beta increases from 0 pie from the past one and then omega c it remains at pie and remains constant after
so now if we look into the sp6, we can find out an appropriate section as islb 350 at, say, 0485 kilo newton per meter
hello to all
now let's change the path with the same two points
so when you have high super saturation, that means your crystals can form in smaller pores
for example, let us takes a light lamp which is shining light
i am just trying to state a situation and you try to recollect something that you had experience in the past
so the mathematical expression is given as for a task t
so, if i delete this what will happen this should invoke my b class destructor which it does, so that that is pretty fine
so that is the basic problem of a design & the way to do it, what we usually follow is to have some prototype functions
from here to here whatever length is there that's represented by 4 units
and this kh value can be taken as 07 for in long slotted holes loaded parallel to the slots
and by applying maxwellõs laws to a particular waveguide what we call a rectangular waveguide like this, we get 3 types of solutions
they all came together later and started quarrelling amongst each other saying no this is a fan, this is a rope, this is a pillar, this is a snake, none of them really agreed upon this
so, we must particularly improve the strategies in order to maximize the profit in order to maximize the benefit so these are the strategic nets at the organization level we must see then strategic level are the program level then strategic what strategic techniques or the strategic actions are the project level they have to be defined clearly so that the benefits will be maximized for the project or for the program or for the organization so next we'll see about to quantifying the benefits how we can what quantify the benefits
so, based on the previous text that we have seen, you could be able to see that a lot of information has been directed to the student
supposing like in the previous example you give a triangle now once you given triangle you need to know which are the nodes in it
so, after the trial and error method, if you calculate that total amount, if you take it, say for example we pay a principle of how much, 61,000
so, i am looking at regions very close to the antenna right
first let us talk about capacitive touch sensor that can detect physical touch
only it cannot be some other path, because if there is a shorter path up to v n, then you could have reached v j via that path
for end, zero is the controlling value, one is the non controlling value for, or one is the controlling, zero is in non controlling
so, with this we will stop
and why do you think so
so we have to know, and accordingly we have to find out, what is the fu value and what is fy value and what will be the uhh strain at fu and strain at fy right
field current is actually dc; how can we show it in a phasor diagram
so these are the two faults
in this problem you have to find solve for i, i2, il, voltage is 120 volt rms, that means you take the reference 120 angle 0 degree and frequency at this 60 hertz
they should go hand in hand for the benefit of both
but if i know how to make my life easier i am going to give you this additional info that this entire object is this x 1 this entire object is x 1 x 2
he was a regular at coming late to class
so, it is the of the form log x for x very small
so, this is the no load conditions this is shunt motor circuit diagram, this is i l 0, this is your what you call i f, because 230 volt being a voltage supply voltage is v, r f is given to 230 ohm no external resistance shown here, i a 0 your what you call your this is the i a 0, r a is given 0
so n will be 2
first let's understand the case that what the case is all about and what are the requirements of this case
because basis function a is 0 by now
so, we are taking a partial derivative basically of the inductance in that inductance might vary with respect to current as well, because if i reach saturation the inductance value is going to decrease because the permeability is not a constant but given i as a constant we are trying to look at how the inductance varies one with respect to the position alone and this gives me what is the force so if you recall what we had done earlier
so this will become zero, zero
if the nstid bit set 1 then the ns bit is forced to 1 now this because of this additional nstid bit which is sent to the mmu the mmu would be able to identify or distinguish between secure world load or store request and a normal world load or store request
now we have three variables two here and one more here, you understood better prepare next time, okay better notes next time not like this on pieces of paper, , , good, ok
so, finally, the net profit will be calculated in the income statement or in the profit and loss account
8 degree into your this angle minus 120 degree right because, into 1 in to 1 this one
so so each inverter is driving another inverter which is u times larger, which means the affective delay will be t p, zero t p
now, we will discuss how to realize a voltage controlled voltage source with gain 1 or a voltage buffer using a mouse transistor
but actually it is $3,96,000
on the other hand, it is possible that the target square is not reachable
793 because this decimal place is truncated if you take up to three decimal places or here you take up to five decimal places
the scattered field obeyed the maxwell’s equations because, total field obeyed incident field obeyed
so you use fb in the second point i'm using fb and then keep reducing the value of fm2
the principal nodes here are 1 and b because these are the only two nodes where number of branches connected at three, so you have got principal nodes
so, v square actually v is 8, we have computed divided by r is 8 ohm
ok, so by introducing repeaters in between, the total delay can be reduced
on the other hand, if this is a new group of people who have never done this before; you might need to describe to step in more detail
implementation will need it, implementation means which ever will write the body of this functions the definition of this functions these codes, which certainly go in a separate dot cpp file, that is certainly needs to know what is the name of the class it needs to know, what are different methods and so on
2, so it is 7200 kva right
and now see that the switch is so, that it when it is connected to this it is ok, but then when i am changing from here to here, this will touch this resistance first before it disconnects from this is a switch ok
so, as you can see, i have seen earlier that the carry module can be implemented like this: three and gates and an or gate with the function like this
2 into 50 micro second this we have seen earlier right, that is crest value or peak value reaches in 1
somebody’s death, somebody’s separation, somebody’s school changed fight between parents, i had my one of my professors in nimhans in child psychiatry, i asked her once that i said it is very disturbing to see depressed kids and all i am talking about 94, 95
it could be a metal, it could be plastic explosive or whatever is different from the permittivity of mud
and since this is non constant, i can assign through this because is pointing to a non constant integer
except replace e f by k b t and if you do that the density of states 25 milli electron volts above the band is still a large number, 6
while in network analysis the things are opposite, there will be only one answer
so let us illustrate this with the help of an example
the signal flow graphs are as we have already discussed about signal flow graphs in the previous modules
now, say here on the time axis i mark the points where i take the samples
so, i will be able to determine the parallel parameters
it seems to imply a quality acquired through negative activities conveying a poor image or a poor health image of the speaker
you have to take this as a drop because one more thing ia what i have taken right now i have taken as a resistive load, who says it has to be only resistive
so these are the steps which we need to remember
as a special case if we say that xd that is the input is unit impulse function, we will say that access is nothing but equal to one
if it is non virtual, it will use static binding; if it is virtual, it will create code for dynamic binding, so that the binding will be decided based on the actual type being used at the run time
let us first of all examine really how this is produced so we are going to look at this graphically first as to why a 3 phase time shifted current given to a 3 phase space shifted winding why it would produced a revolving a magnetic field
as an aspect of nonverbal communication, proximity looks at how we treat their space and distance between us and other people in any dyadic or a small group situation
so, under these different projections, we have seen axonometric projection; it is a parallel projection technique used to create pictorial drawing of an object by rotating the object on axis, relative to the projection or picture plane
as i have already told you, in this particular course we shall be demonstrating the concepts using the following boards
this is a straight line and there is a built in potential vo formed at the junction
so, tapping of field coil, diverter resistance and series parallel connection of field coils
in the highest locker protocol, sealing priorities are assigned to resources depending on what is the highest priority task that may use that resource
so, what we are communicating to the audience is that ok, different disciplines and approach adopted by different discipline, it has the meaning, but as of now we do see disconnect
so, there it is, it is the check based on the permissible compressive stresses
v1 we have got 4 s plus one upon 4r s and then we will divide again by s plus 4 to find out the value of i1, now we have i1, we have i2 both are known in terms of the transfer function
what do you have here
that means; we have 1, 2 and 3 hidden lines we have it
this is fine, so i can now write this as equal to q over four pi epsilon zero r, q square over four pi epsilon zero r, and i am left with three quarters minus (refer time 10:00)
so, this at this portion that is why by dash line in this portion is shown by ideal transformer, right and current flowing through this load is i 2 and this current is i 1 and this is i 2 dash
so, if you look into this and just your what you call that follow you apply the same your right hand see if you apply that your right hand rule right, then you can easily find out that the you are what you call the direction of the flux right
now based on this equation, we can derive some interesting cases
so if the power factor angle happens to be 60, i will have one of the watt meter reading to be 0 and the other watt meter reading will have a value which is positive because 30 minus whatever is the angle cos of theta equal to cos of minus theta so i will have a positive value
however, if there are government securities or treasury securities which you can sell without a loss in the price, without the loss or change of price, then such investments can be considered as cash equivalence
exponentially decaying, you want the field to exponentially decay before the boundary
now, which is the causative current i told you, this causative current means cause of the existence of a magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit right that is why we call it is a causative current, so establishing this flux
although c4af is in minor amount but it can also hydrate in presence of gypsum and form ettringite
so let us now list on step by step the design process for the transformer
so, we had only done three items
now, hence the primary and secondary volt amperes will be equal that is v1 * i1 must be equal to v2 * i2 , that is v1 actually is your primary side voltage and i1 is the primary side current and v2 is a secondary side voltage and i2 is the secondary side current
so, i will give a capacitor to him he will connect it or he will insert it in the breadboard, and then you will see the value of the capacitance on the multimeter
you have that object this is the thing what you are getting, based on rotations one will be in a position to get, this true shape this is the true shape and true lengths
so, this green will be from it is at an angle of 45 degree, this is 45 degree ok, because these two are same, so this is at t equals 45 degree
an algorithm consists of a sequence of steps which can we think of as a recipe in order to achieve something
so magnetization is along the z axis, which is this
qualifiers are those modifications of the voice which are caused not only by the changes in the area between the thoracic cavity in the mouth and nose but also bifacial anatomy
minus delta phi 1
so, j s is flowing all the way up and down over here
so here is an example of how we can solve this equation
a coons patch, is a type of manifold parameterization used in computer graphics to smoothly join other surfaces together, and in computational mechanics applications, particularly in finite element methods and boundary element methods, you would like to really mesh the problems of domains into elements and so on
the first output is generated only after a delay of a single gate, but the second output is generated after a delay corresponding to three gates
first component of the cost is the prime cost which includes the material cost, labour cost and the other direct overheads
so, this is very important right this is very important why output offset voltage, because this much amount of voltage we have to adjust to get the output, equals to 0 when i have when i have to balance my amplifier, when i have to balance my amplifier not ground output equals to 0 then i have to adjust my output
so, this is an example just sort of cooked up example of a cross section of let us say breast tissue, which is given by light blue and it has various components ok
next is generate a load model
so, when we remove the current queen we must reset them back to 0
one is a monetary one, the other one is non monetary
and now next one is similarly let me clear it, similarly that dv by dt you take that derivative of this one just 1 minute ah that this is vt is given this expression is given 4 e to the power minus t minus 2 you take the derivative of this one right
so, automatically as that assume minus this terminal will i am not marking here, or marking for you this terminal will be plus this terminal will be minus and current is 8 ampere current is flowing like this
body language expert tanya raymond’s studied all the leading presidential candidates like bernard sanders who sure has lot of smile about after that double digit victory over hillary clinton in new hamster
they had created a plant at gurdgaon and they started manufacturing the product, product started coming to the market and they started distributing it free of cost to the people but finally people or the market rejected the product
then the actual count will depend on where the input cycle starts with respect to the gate time with respect to gate signal
this course is about programming, data structures and algorithms
you can directly relate it to, the fact that products and services can come out of the research, which produces new knowledge
full load current in the high your high voltage winding; this 3 kva transformer, so i 1 is equal to 3 into 1000 mm by 230 is equal to 13
so we have obtained the fault list for the output line z
so, the random value which is going to be present in the canary is obtained from this particular location gs colon 20 that is in the segment pointed to by the gs and at an offset 20 the random data which is present over here which is essentially that segment has is a random store
so, mov is for internal access
so, phi f m f m is equal to your 500 ampere turns that you have calculated here it is, 500 ampere turns
netlist is generated and now we will go into ng spay of spice and run the simulation once again
so, assume that this whole palm is flat
here again, one will see that line
we will see what those things are later
if we know how a low pass filter circuit is, if you know how high pass filter circuit is then by cascading low pass filter with a high pass filter, we can design a band pass filter
this is what we will be using at great length in this particular course
this is an ideal response of the low pass passive filter or low pass active filter
now, click the trimetric view
now you go for cross multiplication, you go for cross multiplication
the shorter one is connected to the ground
r is equal to q delta of r over k epsilon zero
so this is the condition for unconditionally stable
now, if you are filing an indian patent, then you would normally want the search to cover the indian patents
now this works quite well, especially on puf switch and we actually modelling such a way where the secret model of this puf can be extracted at the manufactured time but nevertheless this technique still has a limitation
and so there is there is going to be a bunch of things over here right and the pulse basis function if i call them as b n right, b n of let us call it r prime right; it is going to be some integral over a d r prime that is how we did it whatever is inside does not matter
these are additional details
so, that is the very important to understand very important to remember now the essential building block of border i c is a differential amplifier it amplifies the difference between 2 signals has excellent stability high versality high versatility immune to noise and interference signal and hence in most of the analog circuits ranging from dc to high frequency applications the it is used the differential amplifier is used differential amplifier is used in most of the most of the application when we talk about the operational amplifier, all right, easy; easy to understand very easy, right
so that is energy that is carried by the electromagnetic wave, or that is the intensity that we received
so as the tittle says lifecycle assessment it is to look at the whole cycle of the life of a material
so, the very important conclusion is that we need non linear devices
the joint using hsfg bolt when no slip is permitted and when slip is permitted
so, now we have completed different schedules
simple boundary conditions
934 meter
so i may have basically the winding rather put up only here in the central portion
in this case my boat will not melt and only the material within the boat will melt easy
i will get an oxidized silicon wafer with electrodes and su 8
6 channel means you could connect 6 inputs for conversion; 8 channel means you could connect 8 inputs
so, it is you know if i had a function like this; if this is the actual function, i am trying to make a piece wise constant approximation of this function right i am going to say this is how i am going to approximate my function
also, the current i 1 which is flowing in the network a will also flow in network b because in case of series network the current flowing through all the networks will remain same
so, it means for the factory i think we have only this much of the items
so, what we show is; this entire rectangular scooped out region we will show it by two dashed lines
minus 1 right; so this term should just give me a minus 1
now here what you have is a power divider recall we have covered power divider, 2 identical power dividers, 2 identical delay lines and 2 identical amplifiers
now this angle i may call as delta again, but please not ef is lagging behind the terminal voltage v
as for as a scientific investigation in this area of facial expressions was concerned, we have to acknowledge that darwin was the first person to suggest the idea of the universality of human emotions
see earlier, we talked about this integral control on off control, pid control all these things, so all these things can come into the picture here
because, any aspect of non verbal communication cannot be taken in isolation
so, when we are ah when we are taking without capacitor ah that that initial load studies that using this method it was coming 57 point something it was coming
so now see you have actually this is the g equal to 1 circle
so, that is why finally around 1895 people accepted ac as a preferred voltage source
on overall, the wireframe model always consists of coordinate values of vertices
so, the leakage reactance typically of a transformer will be, if i look at in terms of voltages drop, then voltage drop will be only about 2 percent or 3 percent, nothing more than that
so, we have a base here
so total it up, these three things total up, less closing stock of raw material and finally you come out with the information that is called as cost of raw material consumed
so this gives me mu zero i over four pi times two pi r times r over r square plus z square
now, 45 degrees inclination we have to find it on xy from point a
so, it's the total cross sectional area of the confined wall panels in one direction divided by the sum of the floor plan areas in all the floors
so, this is your what you call that after second iteration the voltage
ok, so these inputs which are coming after cloning, they have to be driven
now we will go to the most important technique that is called as ratio analysis
actually only 1 in about 10 people can cause these wrinkles on purpose
so, that means, your this one, your the radius mean radius r, circular cross section the of the diameter is d
as you can see, this is a test from our laboratory, you can see how the edge that is getting compressed due to the lateral force acting, that compressed toe is crushing
along with that this 4 ohm resistance was there, so 4 and 4 both are in series
083 square root of fm but this is limited irrespective of the compressive strength it has 0
so i am going to use this block to complete the feedback
this we have already seen again in the theory class, what we have seen, that when we apply the input signal to the inverting amplifier, the output would be opposite phase
this is actually making use of a known relationship to find an interval
you close the tap and one or two drops still falls in the bucket and you realize that the ripples create in the water, it takes certain time for the ripple to settle down
for example, let us look at this auxiliary planes
when the temperature is less than 27, this is my controller output; the heater is on
now see this a 0 and omega 0 are the amplitude and frequency at of oscillation
when 2 devices communicate with each other, if one device runs at a higher rate other device does not runs at that rate, this device must know at what rate the other device is communicating
now, we are back to fibonacci of 3
so, the critical aspect what this paper talks about is how would we make triggering the hardware trojan difficult
as i told you that this is the most confidential statement for the companies for the manufacturing organizations because cost reducing the cost of production is the secret for the companies
e m is the maximum value of the voltage generated, right
the open circuit test v 1 is equal to 230 volt, k is equal to the trans ratio 230 or voltage ratio 2 by 150 is equal to 2
you see blue one on the left corner, you can you point it out 3
so, i should expect three terms right; in the when i evaluate this integral ok, this just to anticipate what happens
so, add it up, put it in the inner column itself
so, a ramp is a function that changes at a constant rate right
if something is put into the way in which a product works, then that cannot be protected by a design
3 actually shows the values of a dc current and then sine sudden ac current
both kinds of variances can be avoided
so, there is a negative variance of the 2
so, separately we are considering
setup means, setup means changing of the machines for the manufacturing of the different type of products
so, if you going to figure it out to marked up to d matrix
so in summary you know what is initially given is the loaded q factor that you have to achieve
06 into 10 to the power 6 by 8 into 300 square 83
whereas, the physical property in the book itself says the pages, the ink used in printing, the cover and the bookmark are all physical goods which are not protected by the copyright regime
dry oxidation can be used for the gate oxides, while for wet oxidation, the thickness will be greater than 0
what is that integral
a because that it is chapter five
rl would be equal to under root of rth square plus xth square
this is the overall structure of the single phase induction motor along with starting arrangement
then i may call this as the electrical energy input
similarly, when j j is equal to 2, m 1 is equal to 2, m 2 is equal to 3 right therefore, s i 3 is equal to v 2 2 square minus 4 into this term minus 4 into this term into v 2 square all these voltage v 1, v 2 everything every every everything is given ah all these all these values are available voltage v 3 a every here it is everything is available right
but in between what it does is it just for no good reason sets name n to have the 17
so, we can understand how we can decide this circuits alright
so, independent sources are usually meant to deliver power to the, your external circuit
so critical in this asynchronous exit is something known as the aep which stands for the asynchronous exit pointer, so note that the asynchronous exit pointer is actually set up during the eenter instruction
here the column number is 2 and the row is 0
so, wp is 43 nanometers and wn is 87 nanometers
yes, they cannot
so the magnetic field b is equal to its magnitude, is equal to mu zero k for s less than b
no material can respond instantaneously to even a springs supposing you apply some force to it does not in one i mean there is no instantly start oscillating it take some time
so ah, we know the magnetic curl of magnetic field is mu, epsilon naught double, double t of e
we will differentiate it
so as far as i understand it is not enough if you have a good writing experience alone
when we are looking at projection of this a b line on to horizontal plane as a top view, we are going to have projection of a projection of b as apparent length which is smaller than the true length in this case
so, regarding combinational a t p g stands for automated test pattern generation
the edge, so it is more like such kind of object
so, there always be different options and based on carefully picking these options we will be in a position to really construct internal external kind of objects
right if this is size n cross 1 and this is size 2 cross 1 i can get this to be an n cross 2 matrix which is this have 1s and 0s in the right places
then what is going to happen
so, if in case you forgot this was my v 2 and this is my v 1 right
so, it is coming actually v square upon v c square
let me put down that part of the circuit again
so let see how ah abhirami is able to do that and obviously there is a consumer for this data, right
now, in this case the circuit must have one common reference, so in this case this is the common reference for both sub networks, so we will connect them together so that we get the common reference of overall network
but then we can roughly categorize the stakeholders into two categories
i will consider an input current ii in parallel with a resistance rs and this is gm vgs where vgs is this voltage
see the employee benefit expenses have dropped
so i may be drawing a magnetizing current from the armature side, if i am having a shortfall in flux i may draw no magnetizing current at all if the flux is just sufficient
so, how would one go about computing gcd of m, n
in fact, as i mentioned if you look a dictionary meaning intellectual property rights can be defined as rights that protect applications of ideas and information that are of commercial value
there is another very cute way of looking at it and that is this: if this charge is moving with velocity, constant velocity v, let us attach a frame to this charge
the person who has opted for the third position c is rather picky and choosy in terms of personal choices; for example, the type of shoes, the type of clothes, the perfumes one wears etcetera the person would be rather choosy about it
we can see here angle limits
the gamma out given like this
i think the morality emerged from this and this whole chain of mortality, immortality, right, wrong, good, bad has over thousands of years has gotten into that very deep unconscious mind for everybody
you generally represent it as delta t
its voltage was your v one
autism
so, for example if we have two processes, this purple process and the green process over here and we used the same library function, which in this case is ssl encryption
so, this turns out to be minus 200 times 50, so that is minus 10 times v
as opportunities for sophisticated ict tools have increased tremendously, it has become very easy for instructional designers to incorporate a range of these technology tools or software in the design of their e content
in the books of enron, they would report it as a profit, and in the books of subsidiaries, they will show it as a capital expenditure
so, it means you have now the your gap is 80 rupees and out of that 25% means 20 rupees should come from the long term sources
so, i can define a stack variable here or here; and obviously, before i start using the stack, i need to make sure that the stack is empty which is designated by the top index being minus 1
we have taken some wave form, but symmetrical
so, graphical representation is key for a mark and which is capable of distinguishing goods and services
therefore, the store instruction would store the contents of the edx register to the correct location of mylib int
now if i keep on increasing the voltage frequency about this f h, then i will again see the increase in the amplitude
here the value of parameters can be evaluated by now setting v 1 is equal to 0 that means input port is short circuited and i 1 is equal to 0 that means input port is open circuited
such kind of construction what we are going to make it
because i am essentially looking at the distance decreasing, the air gap decreasing, the reluctance decreasing because of which i should have the flux increasing slightly
i am skipping these two instructions, but if it is not equal then i am going through this add and sub
you can use it
so, i will have the north pole and south pole which are in the form of a permanent magnet
it means that it happens from right to left
suppose there are a lot of people on this island
so in that case i can simply say only a single phase unit i do not have to save a complete three phase unit
so, determine your what you call the node voltage is a circuit in figure 3
in the previous lecture we defined electrostatic potential and what we saw was that e dot d l was equal to minus v two
so the total delay, lets call it capital d
now, from where we got this 5 and 6,700, we will go back to balance sheet
you may also have another type of sulphate attack called internal sulphate attack, here the source of sulphates does not come in from the outside, there is already a source which is built in in the concrete which somehow creates a deleterious reaction later on in the lifecycle of the concrete, okay we will talk about this also, this is also known as delayed ettringite formation
these are examples of control systems; broadly speaking control systems can be either open loop or closed loop
in tahiti, if you are trying to tell a tahitian that you are sad and ask a translator to translate that into tahitian, they will not be able to do so, as there is no word for sadness in the tahitian language
from memory allocation point of view when you allocate 8 bytes it would mean that the 8 bytes starts from here and end over here and besides this there would be some more meta data bytes that gets allocated
if the torque had been 0, ia also should have been 0
so, this is my your so line current
ok, broadly speaking, this diagram shows how we can categorize the basic types of faults, like like in the highest level, the faults can be categorized as permanent or non permanent, and the normal non permanent faults, on the other hand, can be categorized as transient or intermittent
similarly, for the current source if you take; i mean suppose if you take a current source that i 0 u t and its equivalent circuit is shown; this is i 0 into u t
multiple right; so, if i if my cost function let us say i have a variable in one this thing and if my cost function was a nice parabola, regardless of where i start i always end up with the same point
if we are doing it construct, let us do that
let's recall the write them in terms of u, so s is nothing but c times, u, u is the energy density in the electromagnetic field over c square, which is mu over c, and the momentum flow is nothing but u itself
but even if i am reducing the delay of a gate, my timing simulation is saying that the delay is increasing
there is a delta t over here
so, when you change the radiation intensity, you can basically calculate the change in these values
it means that it digitizes the data, compresses it, and sends through a channel where two other data are also moving
it is equal to the local e at that point, which will be a combination of the applied field and the field which is generated due to this induced charges which come because of the polarization
these have to be done carefully and we will look at these next how to evaluate these integrals those of you who have done a course on complex analysis will find some of this familiar if not it does not matter ok
1 farad
so, whenever they are testing the equipment they test all sort of things so, this is actually withstand voltage
so the objective function can be three types
in a treatise, the expression of the emotions in man and animals which was published in 1872, he had propounded this idea that the expression of emotions and feelings on human face is universal in different societies
in step one, you have to actually estimate based on the p and m that you are looking at, calculate what is this quantity alpha
we can directly see source; we can directly see drain
if, if this line changes from zero to one, this will change from one to zero, but for end it will change in the same direction
it means that the circuit which has 1 particular segment in delta formation and it is difficult to solve, you can convert that delta formation into equivalent star and then you can solve the circuit which is more convenient to get the answers
so, what you did in the slightly clumsy way by solving a system of equations over here, you can do in a little bit more systematic way over here
and since the bed joint is subjected to shear stresses, the tension in the joint is acting parallel to the joint and therefore the tensile strength of the joint with tension parallel to the joint or ftp becomes a parameter that is important for us
42 milliampere and theta 2 will be 36
so the process will fail if you cannot reach t and you reach a stage where you cannot label any new grid cell in the next step, which means the path does not exist
and it needs an admin for sure, review team which makes sure that, people are not deleting content or leaving it in there, putting in content that does not belong there
we will not be using this in this discussion, but i mean there is enough literature all that you can look up magnetic frill
so, that is the basic kind of behavior that you will expect when you start exposing the inner of the object in terms of the protected data members or protected member functions
so with the help of these 3 important inputs that is the transaction cost and the opportunity cost or holding cash on daily basis and the variance of the daily cash balances if you take the cube root after solving this
maybe when artificial intelligence and robots start living then, but not
now, if you see directly from this figure, if you do not apply voltage supply here then also you can make out the thevenin's, sorry the norton's resistance, why, how you can get it because this is any way short circuited
i am writing it again so it means this is our total cost and if you have to calculate you have to add up all the direct cost then you have to add up the factory overheads and finally it becomes the 1 lakh 47,500s as the factory cost
so, if i say p b contains the address of b
so we continue with our discussion on clock tree design
ok, this is the requirement of setup and hold time
this is the normal equivalent circuit of the induction machine with v1 being the input voltage or vs whatever, you may call it stator per phase voltage
so, what is etch the window means
so, to make your deflection checks, you will have to use masonry compressive, masonry, modulus of elasticity
so, e f i is very close to the center of the band
so, by using the compensation theorem you can directly see what would be the impact of delta i impact on delta i because of the change in resistance delta r and this is what the compensation theorem says
so, you can write sin 90 degree plus theta is equal to cos theta
so, the total field is going to be incident plus reflected right
so, what should i let us let us not use k let us call this by some other thing let us call this let us say p let us call this p
now, here what do i have on the right hand side
now, if theta is positive then it is inductive; that means, if p 2 greater than p 1 loading inductive if p 2 less than p 1 loading capacity right if p 2 minus p 1 positive means loading inductive
in matlab its very very simple to generate this so, you use your command called meshgrid to generate a grid of x, y points and you evaluate the radial distance this is element wise operation and just find out your bessel j
so, can i without any detailed calculations write down the form of h there
our budget process was defective or actually we have become very, very effective while going for the actual production
so, here i rms is equal to it is because, we have seen know this under root square we have to take
so, basically one of the elements of unconscious he says that is the collective unconscious which primarily is something which, we have borrowed from our pre human stage and this is something that we all share our common past experience as a human race, but then jung also talks about the personal unconscious
o to b' first of all we locate it on that horizontal plane
so, there is something like that goes via up to this level somewhere before that
so, i have this remove the vector side
the highly hash portion these are the lines what one will be going to see
now you could have done better kind of basis functions right, you could have done for basis functions you could have done triangular basis functions, you could have done entire domain basis functions for example, fourier series
at the university we were showing that
instead of this thousand here you have 2000 and instead of this
so in this estimate, after you take this sum total, you multiply thats sum total by two, by n as a normalization factor, and you get an estimate
so, we call it append i just to indicate that it is iterative
now significance of corrosion, i am going to show you 3 case studies where premature corrosion has been observed one is the sunshine skyway bridge, tampa, florida
first of all, if you throw these two voltages into any linear circuit, what you get will be a linear combination of the two voltages
sometimes sections can go neither normal nor on this horizontal things; but some bent kind of views also one can make it
\ so, we will continue our discussion of the finite element method which is the new method which have been studying and the main idea that we want to sort of start building on is this weighted residual idea right
then they have continually monitor that and then they see that depolarization after 2 months or 5 months is actually higher than 100, it is 150
will the currents change
so they will be moving from one latch to another as if this is master, as if this is slave, but it is going through the intermediate combinational circuit
therefore, that i c actually is equal what you call this i c is equal to somewhere here i am writing that i c is equal to i m by root 2, because, this is rms value
and if id is higher than i 0, what happens is that the source voltage vs actually increases
so, this gap between them is good enough compared to 30 kilo ohm and 31 kilo ohm ok
v + is usually referred to as the incident wave and v as the reflected wave
so all that we do is we go back to the solution of the global function which was the perfect solution, but the only difference being that the needed to expose the encapsulation
so it means we have calculated the total cost by dividing it into different components like your prime cost, factory cost of production, cost of sales and finally the operating profit and the sales value is given to us so it means we could find out that this is the 26,250 is the operating profit
i do not know it, but can i calculate it
so in this lecture we shall be talking about some general strategies used to control the clock skew, because ultimately our problem, if you recall, we said that from a clock pin we have to layout a clock net which will be feeding the clock signal to all the terminal points and we have to control this skew in this overall network
so very intriguing idea and when they published this, their paper i was doing my ph
so, difference is there where that power has gone
now, here one 5 ampere current source is there a 10 voltage 10 another 10 both are connected across terminal 1 2 absolutely no problem this is also a valid connection right
so, if we now look at the whole mechanism together we do not need this kind of d init is no more, is not required here
so, so t i 4 minus i infinity t 0 is equal to actually it is 4 second because s 2 was closed after 4 second
these players had entered india after 1991 but their product took some time to come to the people or reach up to the people
the value at the node is common to both elements why create 2 variables 1 variable right
so that's why person year is clearly unsuitable to what for these projects
so, what exactly is a thermal drift
for example, if a spring has no damping coefficient and if i excited once, so what happens
budgets and budgetary control are the very important instruments, tools for again controlling the affairs of the businesses
ok, so the overall optimisation process that targets to meet these requirements is broadly refer to as timing closer
although we know that the actual drain current goes to zero here, we use this
so, you cannot publish first and then patent because, we are already covered this
recursion means, that we are going to solve this problem by solving the smaller problem and using that answer in this case directly to report the answer for our current problem
then the equations everyone knows that electromagnetic the equations are of are maxwell’s equations
output will change the moment input which the same as v n goes below v p ok
this is in the lakhs of rupees 240000, this is in the lakhs of rupees i think i have written here that is in the lakhs of rupees so, it is lakhs
everyone knows soldering and if you are not good in soldering or even if you are good, you see that the solder is not reliable
today, let us see how we can design different kind of filters using the operational amplifier
the kva rating will be 300 no doubt 300 kva, but if i look at the voltage rating 400 whatever we are mentioning is per phase
so the aspect ratio t by w was very small
so, lightning surge voltage and switching surge voltage, but these lightning surge voltages is a very severe one
we had briefly looked at some of these factors at the beginning of this module and we'll examine this little closely today before we move on to behavior in bending itself
alright, so apart from these chemical attacks we may also get other forms of sulphate attack of course there is nothing purely physical or purely chemical, there is always an interpolate of physical and chemical aspects happening but for the ease of understanding people have generally divided sulphate attack into the chemical mechanisms and the physical mechanisms
now, one this is done then another thing next one is that your this is mainly this one is theory, that is lightening which is happening in front of your, in front of us all, i mean not in front of us i mean we can see every day
now capacitor is given
23 right into 10 cube millimetre cube so the zpz we can provide which is higher than the required one so if we select ishb 200 at 40 kg per meter then we can try with this because this is higher than the required one so here we can find out the properties of the section like what is the d value say 200 mm then bf we can find out 200 mm like this we can find out all the properties now after finding the all properties from the code then we can try to find out the actual bending stress coming into the member so the actual bending stress coming into the member can be calculated based on this trial section now i am not going into details of this calculation because of shortage of time so if we calculate this then we can see the required bending strength md will be less than the m whatever we have right so design bending strength for this section will come less than the maximum bending moment acting on the member so what we need we need to increase the section size so what we have to do we have to so first we have consider ishb 200 then again we can consider some higher section where zpz value will be more than this so in this way we have to go on increasing and we have to check whether this is okay or not and because of shortage of time i am not going to check all the steps what i am going to do i am going to find out the final section so after increasing the size of the section we could see that islb 325 section will become same so this calculation i will go into details so for islb 325 section we can find out the relevant properties from is code that is d is 325 meter and bf is 165 millimetre then tf is coming 9
so essentially weak pufs are used for creating cryptographic keys, they are used together with other encryption schemes like they are typically used they are typically not used by itself but typically combined with other cryptographic schemes like encryption or hmac and so on in order to hide the crp
so i'll just switch it on and you'll see that the ring jumps out, and that is the lenz's law
so now what is the standard time minus actual time
yes, because in cash flow statement we are going to start with pbt and making the adjustments
so now you have a position sensitive device which will tell you what is the bend and this is your laser source
and therefore, this pressure would somehow make us fidgeting and therefore, it has been noticed that they are people who are acutely aware of the fact that they have to maintain an eye contact and is still there unable to do it, it results in negative body postures also
and second is face angle that we get from the specimen
so if you see this, this is the unit step function
so, the input so the input applied to this schmitt trigger is like this it increases and then decreases, increases and then decreases, it is a triangular wave input time
passive and active devices; like transistors which are active devices, and resistors, capacitors, inductors etc
now top down is the other alternative
and now we want the right most element
now important for us are the next 4 accesses to the tables by the plain text p4 to p7 so these are done at locations t0 p4 xor with k4, t1 gets accesses p5 xor with k5
so there is a direct connection of two potential devices
then you go for web based training or you go into different things where a person cannot be there with you
the problem is that these are not really such good for looking at thing is in a quantitative way they are really a very qualitative technique
these are d flip flops, so the output of the last flip flop is fed back in to the input of this x or and some other output, like here, d one is also fed as the input of x or
so, this e 2 x this is nothing, but the tangential part of electric field above or below the medium and e 1 x is the tangential part of the electric field above the medium ok
now, i am just going to subtract all of these n minus 1 terms from each other right that is why i wrote them one above the other
with this we come to the end of our discussion on various kinds of output devices like leds and ldrs, various kind of sensors and actuators
now, what we want to highlight in terms of object lifetime here are few things, one we want to see that when an object has a number of data members, what is the order in which these data members are constructed or initialized and what is the order in which they are destructed or deinitialized
mainly to represents prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones or perhaps assembly drawings where different parts have been assembled, joined together; to understand these intricate details we require sections
) the first step in doing so, is that the attacker needs to obtain the binary data corresponding to this particular program
so lets call it s one, t equal to two
in that if we introduce the gap that needs to be closed or the gap that creates a loss in the rise, we can bring in gl by 40 into the expression here and then expanding that have the total rise of the arch as a rise that is going to be compromised by the deflection that is required to close the gap
no problem because in a generator there is nothing like back emf so it is the emf constant,right
but note that power p is equal to i square r is equal to v square upon r right it is it is your what you call it is non linear right
this is very easy and why for example, you have a rainbow because the optical i mean light is travelling at different speeds and the water bubble it disperses ok
now one thing also you try to understand now in this example: so you are moving away in this path, so the amount of movement your doing away you will have to come back by the same amount again
now, if we continue using x as the variable, then we get the following relations for vl and il, that is for voltage and current at the load end
if there are two such gates, the value of c l will be doubled because there is another such pairs of transistors that are being driven
if you cut any edge, it will divide that it up into two parts
so my colleagues here who will take it up from here to build the second customer journey map, ok over to you guys
now, this you can possibly use again because of the nyquist theorem i talked about
language is never in neutral commodity paralanguage sensitizes us to the various dimensions language can have
so, if you set this idl bit to 1
so the example is like this a column of ishb 300 at 576
now, in this process this solves a basic problem of object layout in case of diamond that is this will happen if you have diamond
if you want to add up the elements in a list, so this haskell's type for a list of integers, so it takes a list of integers and produces an integer
so, this is essentially the load at which, the power is maximum
so what we are doing is we have this two sheets which i am writing, just showing by line now, minus sigma, we have the electric field coming down
it will not be able to start on its own
so, very difficult to control the field current and armature currents independent of each other, it will not be possible for me to control those two
this is how ldr works
degree means it is connected to maximum other blocks, the block which is maximally connected to other blocks
i could have made it propagate through polygon also that is i could have done it that this actually is a polygon colon colon draw
so, this part of the material is not perpendicular that is in inclined way one has removed that material also
from another angle, this computer can be visualized as compa comprising of a central processing unit, c p
but look into that in laboratory what we do that we are connected one sp st single pole single throw switch
so let us review once again what we mean by stability
so, we are confident that by doing that you are preventing problems that would occur if you just apply a passive (()) (38:39)
so, it will it will be the current division what is the current flowing through this 2 ohm resistance that is your i t is equal to 5 by current division 5 by 5 plus 2 into your i1t right
these are implicitly used to control the execution of our program
so can we move some of the gates across this flip pop to this side without changing or modifying the functionality
so, direct exchange, ah, let me recap from a producers perspective
not very hard, but we just have to keep taking care of it
so no payment for interest here
whenever there is center and a radius scooped out from that direction we show it by an axis which comes out of that object also
so, let us see integrated circuits have several advantages, first is its miniaturization; that means, it can be made extremely small and when you make something really small; that means, you can increase the equipment density
let us denote this atomic orbitals by the symbol psi of 1 s
now one thing i would like to state for the bilateral phase is that unlike the unilateral case there is not much design flexibility
so consultancy is the act of giving an advice by an expert professional on a specialized area
and because you have different material, thermal expansion coefficients will be different and that is sufficient to cause a cracking between these two surfaces
so in class like is first sam will be opening his bag, taking his notes out
although their profits, the revenues are increasing slowly, the fixed assets are also increasing slowly
in computer graphics, we mainly cover overview of computer graphics, how they have originated and what are the commonly used softwares; little bit about autocad and in detail about solidworks
so it is defined as the ratio number of detected faults divide by the total number of faults
when we study the significance of touch as a part of nonverbal communication we have to understand that the frequency as well as the type of touch is important as it communicates what we feel about the other person and also what we are looking for in the relationship or in a given situation touches can be defined as a communication, which we do with various type of touches during our professional scenario
so, let us sort of start by summarizing what we already know ok, what are we already solved
so, z p is given 10 plus j 8 ohm that is 12
1 why canõt it be 0
so, in this case and this is r f, r f is the field resistance, this is the field that this you also you can vary
if you assume it is ground in nodal analysis you we will apply right
what is the value of ic
this term is zero and therefore this entire term also drops off
and you also see that the common terminal has an arrow like this to distinguish between that and the other terminal
then we load the absolute address of myglob global variable from the got table into the eax register and finally we can indirectly load the myglob global data to the eax register
i have used dnf everywhere during this process because this fedora 23
but i do not know the electric field is sitting in there which is itself an object of computation i do not know the electric field
conducting live sessions for learners where all learners can come together or at one time point view each other’s comments, queries and learn from their peers
so, even if you want to read only one value or only one line it will actually a fetch large volume of data from the disk and store it in what is called a buffer and then you read whatever you need from the buffer
at no load if you had 230 volts, at full load capacitive you would have 240, 250, 260 volts whatever
so, we have to make sure that there is a consistent direction of the field along a given edge it cannot be that 1 element is saying this way the other element is saying this way because the unknown u 1 is common to both and there is only a unique direction to the field ok
now as a student of working capital management or student of finance you analyze this new balance sheet earlier the liabilities current liabilities were 50 uhhh 65 means salary creditors were 65, bank overdrafts was 60 and expense credit was 5
so, it is non inverting amplifier, but it is not much different from the difference amplifier
although line is not carrying power or current, but line will remain charged
similarly, how far that is from one of the edge that also we will have it
and like i said quality assurance is always there
often people think that when they are viewing our candidates official photo, they are learning about the candidates a unique traits, but our findings suggest that they are also learning about the candidates culture and the emotions it values
so, with that we are basically going to be able to write down what is the moment in the cross section supported by the cross section itself
so, norm is 3, but they can bring down maximum financing as for the requirement
so, in this case, if you come to this that ; that means, the direction of the your voltage rise
supposing, you wrote some junk code like this we set x equal to 7 and then we say del x, and then we ask y equal to x plus 5
five control signals are there
and we deactivate the input, we set vi equal to 0
this will be volts, right
four terms each exponential when i integrate, i will get an exponential the two the limits will give me two terms
fine, now we, when we model wires so we have seen earlier also in the various delay models there will be distributed resistance and capacitance values
it is actually making an investment into technological growth or innovation led growth and the state can actually now see that the public sector has a role that is different and distinct from the private sector
so, it will be i t is equal to 2 plus 3 e to the power minus 15 t ampere right
so this is like a three stage mechanism that actually is prevailing here and this on the right you see several images that are sort of supporting this evidence
so we do not know exactly from where this one and two nets are coming
so, if i go to the next section, if i go to the next section that will be the feedback in op amps
as i'll show here, divergence of h is equal to one over mu, zero divergence of b minus divergence of m
so, for example if let us say the ciphertext has a value say 0xff if the key value was 0, lookup is to the location 0xff
so, breadboard is an alternative approach is a better approach to making the circuit, and test it and then we move on to the printed circuit board, all right
so i hope, so this is we have come now to the end of this course um, this is the last topic of this course and i hope you like this course
similarly, the area element in the y direction is going to be perpendicular to the y axis and its going to have the x element, x width, d x, height, d, z and therefore in that direction, d
suppose if before series capacitor if it is v is equal to say 0
normal components is that a wise idea, when we derive our reflection coefficients from a planar interface we did in the undergraduate course what did we do
probability density function
these electrons and hole pairs are then separated by applying a reserve bias to the junction, so that the electrons go towards the n side, holes go towards the p side and then you have a current
this has already happened this has gone out of our hands
now, we will apply those methods in designing one full product that is single cylinder engine
so, any additional stuff if i would like to use, one over other i can construct
so, every time the state undertakes a risky activity, wherein it could suffer losses and it could also make gains the state is actually getting into or discharging its entrepreneurial function
you may have studied in electronic communication course in your undergrad
all the lime goes to the cement industry
so, if i take the equilibrium of the rigid block around o at ultimate the lateral force h u into height h equilibrated by summation of n n and p into length by 2 and therefore you can get an expression for h u which is n plus p into l by 2 into h and you see that this is not governed by any material strength
we have discussed that these are necessary for enhancing learning engagement to deepen their understanding for learners to get a grip on the topic and to be able to apply it
so, the first term so, remember this is going to be g and grad g those are the 2 terms
they know it that when there is a change in the income level of the people, there is upward change in the income level of the people, then certainly people are going to demand more products apart from the necessities, people are going to expect the comforts, even the luxuries
now these outputs we refer to as the next state, and these inputs that are coming from the flip flop, they are referred to as the present state
so, this structure is known as h plane tee
they collide with the atoms of the crystal lattice to form additional electron pair
x 2 y 2
2 that is also 180 watt the way one you can compute the your power, but is a resistor
as i said, you don't want to make the masonry fail in this test
sometimes if it is the numerical if it is our slip speed then we will take the difference of these 2 ns minus n right
so, 40 and 50 in parallel right whatever it will come with that 20 ohm is in series whatever it will come with that again 30 are in parallel to this; that means, if i make it like this, it will be actually whatever it comes 50 i making like this parallel to 40 right whatever it is plus this 20 will come making on it only plus 20 will come
this is the same amount we took to the closing balance for the month of february became the opening balance for the month of march and then we kept again 5,000 as the minimum cash balance
so, exploitation by giving permission to somebody to use it what we call a granting permission is called as a licence or by a sale
they will be added in the cash flow statement general expenses no adjustment discount on issue of debentures will it involve any cash flow indirectly yes because when we issued debentures we should have got cash but to the extent of discount we will not receive cash it is a f type of item it will also have impact on operating flows because it is one of our expenses but it does not involve any cash okay so i have marked it as o f getting it in operations it is plus and in f it will have minus
so obviously the rotor will look at that field as though it is stationary because the rotor itself is rotating at synchronous speed
so, from based on this, we define the polymorphic type with the virtual function
a head nod is used to show our agreement, our approval, while be a talking to other people, it also shows that we are able to comprehend their ideas and that we are continually attentive to them
this is what came up in my observation
so, figure number i have not given here if the capacitors are connected in dell tan shown in figure actually this is the figure know number is required here it is numerical
the fourth reason is exhaustion
so, just for simplicity i will take it to be an n type, so that the excess carriers or holes
as a result even if i want to get a 1 at this point, this 1 will get discharged by this path and this 1 will be modified to 0
3 right where beta is the is calculated based on the shear lag distance bs and bs is taken from the furthest edge of the outstanding leg to the nearest bolt or weld line in the connected leg of the cross section so for rapture strength calculation other than the single angle section we can use this clause that is clause 6
now, the core flux actually no load phasor diagram, the core flux is common to both primary and secondary windings in a transformer that i showed you in the beginning and is thus taken as the reference phasor in a phasor diagram
in shaded pole motor what happens is if this is one of the poles i am going to have a small protrusion in this pole
e and f there is one, i think, non other, but you think of those imaginary vertices
the only change will be the angle value
in this particular case, this exponential, the right hand side of it is independent of vs
so, p is any point any point such that op is equal to x
so all those expenses which are not operating expenses, non operating expenses, for example, salaries of the office employees
so, we have to move parallel to that and perhaps make a cut section
so, the results of a search could be a product that comes out of the work of different searchers who have searched different categories
infrastructure, right
so again, that is another benefit
essentially, you will basically have two elements in the p i r sensor and the elements
in this approach we are looking at the signal probabilities
so, you have a t m and t n which is of this form it has some a b c d, and i am going to take the dot product ok
so, if i try to multiply v and i, i am definitely going to get some negative power here
student siddhartha: dc++ is a intranet repository where, usually institutes incorporate this thing and all the students can go online into this dc++ either upload all their content say movies, documents anything since if we four of us are connected to dc++ and we four are sharing our files, say i have hundred movies, he has hundred books, he has some other content and you might be having some other content which you want to share it with all your peers
so, this the disclosure is important because the claims are drafted or carved out of the disclosure
so, this 8051 port 3
and certainly if i call the new function g, d dot g then it will call the d dot g, which is so this is the basic notion of inherited functions that we had seen
similarly at basement it is very thick, so that also we represented by hatched lines
now, z fg is equal to 1 upony fg so, it is coming 4
the difference between the sales and the marginal cost or the variable cost is the contribution and their contribution is towards meeting the fixed expenses plus earning some profits
in the steel sector, large larger market share was with the sale and then were small companies, means the second market company in the market was disco
neither income, neither expense, it's a balance sheet item
due to rg and m0 with a single resistor whose value is rg plus 1 by gm 0
now b is equal to flux density vapour meter square, i armature current in a conductor that is ampere, l is equal to length of each conductor that is meter
income tax authorities do not allow the use of lifo method
initially it was free of cost and the product was a welcome product by all who used that and finally then he thought of that i can now commercialize this the production and start selling it in the market and when he started manufacturing it he priced the one kg of the nirmah washing powder for 10 rupees in 1982
but there is no reason why a d, e, d t term cannot be here
so, here nodal analysis we have already studied
this everything you need to understand all right
we can use the same argument if you want to make a p type semiconductor
so, these would be the nodes, node voltages with respect to the reference node that is node 3 in our particular case
they have suggested that chronemics of e mail are significant nonverbal cues as all users check the time stamps
so, what really happens in a confined masonry wall is something that i would like to discuss and see how we can then extend that to our estimates of in plain flexual capacity and shear capacity of the confined masonry wall
here i cannot do that because it is the end of the domain i have nothing to the right of this
so, the first one is called a, the second is called b, and third is called c, and within the body of the program of the function a, b and c will refer to the values which are passed to this function for a given call
and especially, in a market like india, where the cost of search can be substantial, it would put the client in a precarious position, because a client would end up expending a huge amount of money for the search and then later on could eventually realize that there was nothing to patent at all
now the voltage source is 20 angle 90 degree so you can conveniently write it as j 20 in complex form
op amp itself many have noise generated by the associated passive components, but there is a possibility of a external noise that comes out of the function generator and is introduced to the op amp all right
you can actually do that, you can even put a revenue something like that and actually track it much more in detail and see the correlation for yourself
so i have put it in a different distance but inside the metallic sphere so that outside the poisson's equation remains the same: r minus d z is equal to square root of r square plus d square minus two r d cos theta
so, in case of 8085 we have seen the serial communication
so i am directly calculated
and possibly it will map 0 for say like minus 8 volt, maybe this will get mapped to 0 0 0 0 ok, then minus 7 volt will get mapped to 0 0 0 1 minus 6 volt will get mapped to 0 0 1 0 and soon ok
this this is delta e actually this is your delta e so that means, this is going this way and this delta e is going this way right
shifting body or feet position when seated, rubbing, touching, scratching, picking oneself, scratching, tapping of a pencil on the table, can be considered as examples of adaptors
so, very useful for time domain formulations, can you think of some examples where you might where the problem is naturally post in the time domain
this is going to be quite heavy as well
support for resource sharing protocols, because without use of proper resource sharing protocols, there can be priority inversions and tasks may miss their deadline
so, here if you see the opens the equivalent of the thevenin's equivalent, this would be voc is nothing but vth in series with resistance rth
and phase three is, once you have found out a path, you clear all the cells that have been labeled during phase one and the path which have been identified
if you write a c++ program and include the c++ standard library, you will simply include it as hash include io stream
so, a way to compensate the effect due to bias current is by using a resistance at their non inverting terminal to the ground of an op amp ok
so for me the honest question is in design thinking itself if you think about what we have been talking about in the course itself is that we are going through it in a systematic methodic approach, right so you have seen it in my class as well when you were in my class
so, usually when student learns cem for the first time they think pulse basis delta testing
so what the code gives you an entire set of verbal requirements which is again reproduced here in this drawing for the different types of walls
now, with focus f 2 from here, as a centre and radius b 1; so, b is here b 1 is that
network synthesis is the process of obtaining an appropriate network for a given transfer function
so that air is going to offer some resistance to the movement of the machine, that particular loss encountered because of the presence of air or wind, surrounding wind that is known as windage and this will be more if the machine is trying to rotate faster because it has to displace the wind more, so it is like fan
so if i have a fault, f stuck at zero, then also f equal to zero
so, basically, net area means gross area minus hole area
now, the complete solution will be consisting a natural response as well as forced response so you can write the total current i is nothing but forced response and natural response of the current, now natural response of the current is same as we got in previous section when we discuss source free parallel rlc circuit, so we can write those equations, so what we got
the context switching time for operating systems is substantial sometimes compared to the small task execution times
also this is the difference between these two terminals ok
some other value
if you do so, you will get the 12 i plus 2 i 2 is equal to 100 this is ah your equation 6, and another one you will get minus 2 i 2 plus 10 i 1 plus 6 i 3 is equal to 0, this is equation 7
so, when i use a word, like i said, every time when i am im pressing it very heavy on and each word, you have to go and you have to see what are kinds of rectifiers;, bbecause it may not be covered in this particular lecture
so, these are called hidden fault what we will not discuss about those things
1, zone 4, 1
i mean it is 1 2 ah your then 3 up to k th capacitor then n th
i have also put few practical exercise tasks for you on the google drive which you can download
and from the total sales value, either it is anticipated value, expected value or actual value, from that sales value, if we subtract the cost of production, then the difference is called as the operating profit, right
the current drawn by the armature will be somewhat smaller as compared to the stator current drawn by an induction motor normally at a given rating both of the ratings are the same
similarly, between g and d there is a vertical edge
so hi guys, what we are trying to do now is we will be using design thinking concept and try to build a case study on few problem statements we’ve identified what the school students are facing today in today’s generation
so, i have not heard the activity teachers now complaining to the parents, that your child is not interested in playing
therefore p 1 is equal to v l i l cos 30 degree plus theta and this theta is equal to 36
that this particular circuit will give inductor as a short circuit because it is switch is connected for very long period and the capacitor will be open circuit because it will be charge to certain value and it will act as an open circuit
so, the small side is this one
we will take this expression and modify this for the phosphorous atom with in the silicon lattice
so the gds itself is proportional to the drain current
so, you can see how important this is just a glimpse of how intellectual property developed by universities has been perceived in the market
in the last lecture, we learned about some basic assembly methods that were some standard mates available in solid works
ohmõs law states the voltage is nothing but the current times the resistance another way of writing it is; resistance is voltage over current unit of voltage is just volts, unit of current is ampere
this is also a multimeter all right
so ultimately, the bottom line is we want to achieve the greatest possible clock frequency
hmm, so this you’re primarily thinking in terms of only mobile application or this could be extended to web or
what we could do is we could still have the inductor like this and make a coupling to the inverter let us have a kind of a we will push the naming here and let us couple the inductor such that we can have interpose an isolation here and let the prevailing action of the inductor happen through the secondary
i woke up in the morning, i brush my teeth, i had my breakfast, i went to work, i came back from work and i had lunch in between, i had dinner after i came back from work and i went to bed
the fixed feature space is characterized by those constants which are given to us, those immobile aspects which we normally cannot change, for example, wall, the territorial boundaries etcetera
so you have the elastic design force which helps us establish the lateral seismic coefficient and the base shear for the building and you divide that by a value greater than one which is why you're reducing the design force if the system can give you a certain ductility
so, i can write this as 1 minus 2 ok
3 percent of the world’s population, they have been identified to have experience depression
specifically, in this algorithm library which is a very interesting library, because what it is saying that, if you are using c++, we give you a set of whole set of common algorithm
the compressed zone is now further reduced in this case like we did for the case of out of plane bending we can assume that an equivalent stress block can be used to represent the parabolic distribution of stresses
yeah, so, why it should this correspond to reality is the question right
however, if you look at wall b, then you see that the direct shear and the torsional shear are in the same direction
since it is a sticky note you can also draw little visuals even a stick figure would do fine
so what we can do, we can create 1 super node, which includes v 1 and v 2, because these v 1 and v 2 are connected through some voltage source
so using kvl again you can solve the circuits where you see these kind of magnetically coupled coils
first we learn what is an integrated circuit
this is the example of a via connection that i had said
so here the floor plan is represented by not one but two graphs: directed acyclic
alternatively you could also apply a voltage and the current that flows will be equal to v by r
i will share with you two stories
so how does a zero skew clock network look like for a typical example
so, in this case will the fields be unique there is no boundary anywhere it is in middle of interstellar space; will the fields that you get from this antenna supposing i have specified the current over here will they be unique
5 million or the 15 lakh worth of the dollars
right so, what we did there was we also wrote down a del squared phi plus k n squared phi is equal to q n, but here so, for example, i got two equations from each region
so, here i write it is v b c, so it is plus, it is minus
so, by a first you if you first apply ohms law , from ohms law v 1 is equal to i into r 1 and v 2 is equal to i into r 2
and then there is a reload mode where the recently flush data is accessed taken so that it is reloaded back into the cache
the first one of course, was to make videos short and we can put this short in quotes because it is really up to the instructor and instructional designer to decide how short they are, but the way to do it is to identify the logical pause points and the chunks
now, let us assume that the there are two eigenvectors attached to each eigenvalue
so, v thevenin is equal to 12 volt here, it is already solved here everything is solved here
so, now can you tell me supposing i solve for and find phi 1 and grad phi, 1 how will i find the field everywhere
and when you put them together, it becomes the budget instrument or the budget document
so once again, let’s go back to the quarter wave transformer for a moment
earlier we had looked at in the manual criteria, the second criterion was when the tensile strength of the unit was reached but now we are not going to be examining it in terms of the unit or the motor, you are going to be looking at tensile strength of masonry
so, sorry, i would like to make one correction here please for your reference
that means you identify the false path and accordingly you compute the arrival time so that you get a good estimate
this will be your plus, then a 3 1, then your a ah 1 2, then your a 2 3
okay, what is next in terms of, so now i know how it looks like i know what sort of have a pulse on what the product is like what they like, what they do not like, what they have and what they do not have, i sort of have an idea but i do not know how it will go forward
so, in this case what happened, the system is balanced and it is sufficient to consider single phase right
so now when it is connected to v1 then you will have some current i1 flowing through it and the v1 will be across it and you will get i1 into r after getting this value if you switch over from point 1 to point 2 it means that now it is connected to voltage v2
basis function should be can be chosen little bit more intelligently right
so, r1+ r2 dash i am calling as r equivalent and the drop in the r equivalent will be in phase with the current
so, i mean look at the various features of it what is the frequency term is appearing here in the denominator right
so, if you give 100 millimeter bond beam reinforcement, then the spacing is about 3 meters, which means you must at least have a, if your interstory height is about 3 meters, you must at least have a roof band and a plinth band
let us click that power line, then click that button hold it, drag along that line, it removes that line
a class which does not have any super class or parent is necessarily the base class and the root class, but classes like who exist in the middle could be derived class for one part of the inheritance and base class for the other part of the inheritance, and we could really have variety of different complex and hybrid kind of inheritance structure that we would like to encode and understand in c++
lets see, five is from here to here and four is from here to here
notice that we are getting these empty brackets, this is the returned value
now let us look at the critical question, why should i why should my reality correspond to a sparse solution
now, let us construct an object on the front plane
ideally this gap the resolution or the gap should be very small and ideally 0 for an ideal op amp we will say that this is equal to 0 so that means, the pattern the input output characteristics should be like this
now this domain was capital d
similarly, t1 has to, t1 may in the worst case undergo 5 units of inversion on account of t4
now, the stationary and rotating parts are separated from each other by an air gap just i show in the diagram right
that is your back substitution ah, gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, cramers rule and numerical analysis
in any element, your electron in the solid can be treated as a wave
what will be the pitch distance
he said that coming together is beginning
so, figure i will come, so figure 9 in general illustrates the principle next i will show
so, if we are able to bring it down to weekly budgets
so, when you look at commercial fdtd software, one of the most important knobs is this courant stability factor
now, off you can now see anything correct, now what are the different things here one is towards here if i go towards this side right; that is, towards the in the in the anti clock direction, if i go anti clock then i can see voltage, right
so, competition is another important factor which creates a problem which means causes the change in the demand and we have to make use of this while estimating the demand or forecasting the demand for the in the time to come
43 if this is theta then cos theta will be this that is becoming 0
just as we did over here, once i fix my f naught i get my delta t, i use the courant parameter to fix delta x ok
and from this kind of par your current source and this resistance is there in parallel, if you transform this current source to the voltage source, then this v should be is equal to i r this r should be in series vice versa right so, similarly one more thing
so, when this is done we say that rose is a specialization of flower and we can say the same thing in a reverse way
so, we look at how the epoch is defined which is defined to 128 over here as seen over here and the time period is 2 ^ 24 which means that these loops are run for a total of (2 ^ 24) * 128 times
so, it will be basically your ah it is your 25 and 100
now here in both of the cases your current is going inside the dot for reference polarity is positive in both of the sides where the dot is connected it means that the mutual inductance mutual voltage which you get because of the magnetic coupling of these two coils will be positive
now in case on intermediate batten we will means will consider same that is 3 fourth of 220 plus 2 into cyy so that is becoming 201
so, it is periodic, both in electrical as well as wavelength and as well as frequency as we shall see later
so, what is nice about this stability criteria being derived in this what i will call an intuitive way is that it is very easy to generalize this idea to higher dimensions 1d is fine a question you can ask is in 2d is the courant stability criteria the same right
that infant are basically endowed with the inborn cognitive capacity to have a subset of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust okay
and for parameter sensing, you need various sensors like temperature sensor or humidity sensor or pressure sensor
you can have single phase clocking or you can have multi phase clocking
ah from equation 60 we know the refraction coefficient can be expressed as this we have seen that tau is equal to your 2 z upon z plus z c
so we have 1,2,3,4 nodes, it means that it will have n minus one that is three branches
on upper side up to which level i can really go on the lower side up to which level i can really go with that dimension, is it 24
it's up to us
till the time the company is existing in the market, you have to pay the fixed cost
now, if i make the input more positive than this; that means, v n more positive than v p; then output will switch immediately from a positive value to negative value right
in these cultures we find that multitasking is considered as a value and therefore, a certain flexibility is encouraged
if we know that top view front view and top view, is there a way we can determine what it might be in true shape
now if there are two or more elements which are connected in parallel then they are connected to same two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them
and then i adjust the feather headed line right at the end and then i want the participant to make an inward movement, and then i say that fine will dominant hand and the non dominant hand, what is the degree of illusion when it comes to making an inward versus an outward movement and remember inward outward movement has to do with the joints, the body joints
now we said that electrons move from n to p, so that we have a net positive charge on the n side, and a net negative charge on the p side, which means there is an electrical field
it may be possible that id and bodofon joint venture is in loss
now, the state equations for the network are written by first equating the current in c and voltage across l in terms of state variable and the applied voltage
how efficiently the information generated with the help of financial accounting and with the help of cost accounting
yeah, what the child would feel to say
so we see that we are working on forces here, unlike the earlier expression which was in terms of stresses
so, you just simulated some very small part of the pulse and you have not excited because those frequencies were not generated you have not actually been not able to study your problem properly right
when certain changes of uhh geometry properties are there, say stress concentration
so, i am showing an example 1 plus 2 star 3 minus 4, if i have to evaluate this expression though we read the expression from left to right, when we go to evaluate this we will not strictly be able to evaluate left to right
so you can see that the checker board model is more efficient in terms of space, the number of vertices in this graph will be much smaller
in the next class, we will learn more about tolerances and where we use these tolerances, why they are important
so, if you do so, then current flowing through this you find out; so, total resistance here it is 8 ohm, here it is 4 ohm 12 ohm
the idea whether it touches appropriate or not is very interestingly displayed in this video
another thing you know that i s c square r the copper loss is equal to wattmeter reading because total r is r 1 plus r 2
so, it says that the field and by field i am talking about e and h created by some sources j ok
so, here we can see a drawing sheet template having certain width and a length; it is a very long rectangular sheet drawing paper
01 that is your no load slip, so n 0 will be 99 rpm
so now the internal logic will do some [vocalized noise] computation based on the applied input
in vacuum does the incident field satisfy maxwell’s equations
we have been looking at laplace's equation for electro static potentially
for c, it is public sorry private specifier protected inheritance, protected inheritance, resultant is private
so, when we are looking from this view this line will be visible and this one there is one more line visible
and, then slowly we stop at that position or then if it reaches that position at once will it reach quickly or will it go there slowly
05 times v rated divided by 50 hz due to which i am going to have actually flux under short circuit condition is less than 5 percent of rated flux
today we will be looking purely on extrinsic semiconductors
you may say that, the best way to distinguish a product or a service is by making the product unique or the service unique
so let me first, we had a label name for that and then we shall also say that it has to refer to edt01
student that she took several lines and measured using calcium to silica ratio, so these are average results and what we found that at the interface, the calcium to silica ratio is lower when we have carbon nano tubes and we know lower the calcium to silica ratio higher is the modulus of csh and i quite do not understand it and i presented this i do not know at this conference, at one of the conference where karen was the and she said, she thinks that the for us the carbon nanotube may influence the crystallisation of csh, so that may be the reason but we do not know, but we are just looking but it is very interesting that if carbon nano tube also changes the morphology of calcium silicon hydrate, so it is that really the modification at the nano scale, so that is really a good direction to do it
one goes by the name earliest deadline first and the other is rate monotonic analysis
there are path which geometrically you can see there is a path, but with respect to the signal value the gates will work in such a way that signal will never propagate along those long paths
and, i think now when you are saying the connect between academics and this; this is where clinical and academic can unit; i think this is the time when because see you find lot of academic psychologists right, but you find less of clinical psychologist
so the gate source voltage is vi minus i0 r1
so, such statements polite statements and indirect statements are the ones that are encouraged to use when you are creating these contents
for example, if it's a, there is a television serial in which you are watching and, ah, echo is tune to call a nine one, one number
so i calculate the electric field here on the axis or anywhere e r t is going to be
so, basically i is equal to your i 1 plus i 3 and v 1 is equal to your 2 into i 1 and v 2 is equal to 2 into i 3 and v is equal to v 1 plus v 2, because here it is because we are taking one source at a time here it is v 1 here it is v 2 so, basically it will become v 1 plus v 2 right so, before moving this; so in this case it is very easy to find out what is the i 1 current
so, this is going to be slightly different from what you have seen so far
now these are 3 phase currents
19 up 1
5 v square upon x 2 dash
what is within the multimeter that operates the multimeter
so what the problem is
all i have to do is, if i calculate the potential due to this small charge, lambda d, y, then all i have to do is calculate lambda d, y over four pi, epsilon zero, and the distance of that point from r is going to be r minus y, y, unit vector and this integrate a y varying from minus l by two to l by two, no components, nothing, just one calculation
now what should be the actual thing
you can't ask your employees to leave the organizations because they are permanent employees
8 ; that means, here you have to find out p and for the v a r you have to find out the q right , and therefore, you have to determine , first one , the complex, real and reactive power absorbed by the load , and b) the line currents and c) the kvar rate you have the your what you call three capacitors, which are , can delta connect in parallel with load right that, i will show you to raise the power factor to 0
after talking about the emf equation it will become clearer why we have v1 by v2 equal to n1 by n2, so we will talk about voltage and current relationships
so, this is this power is taken for each of these devices and plotted together for the same input and key
it gives you the what is the average the output, it gives you the voltage across the inductor and the old second balance that is happening and with this we can rate the these two components now let us see during this period that is doing the dts period the transistor is on the transistor is on the pole voltage here is v in then what should be the peak inverse voltage of the diode the peak inverse voltage of the diode should be v in or at least greater than v in because this diode has to withstand a value the potential equivalent to v
the question is what is the order in which the c outs happen which will tell you what is the life cycle or lifetime of the d object and the other embedded objects in this
so s reflected divided by s incident is going to be e reflected over e incident square
so, in that way, we will construct all these stop points
so, but sadness persist beyond the average change what it should be, self limiting people bounce back, but the same adjustment disorder can lead to a prolonged depressive disorder also
so when you apply kirchhoff current law, you know that the current flowing in the ith capacitor can be written as ik is equal to ck dv by dt
now this is a scenario where my focus is exactly on certain types of symptoms, certain types of leads based on which i can deduce something, a conclusion which will help me sharp in my therapeutic intervention, the intervention which intern will be help full for the client
for practical purpose is it may not be possible it is mostly very difficult to look at all the aspects but it is good to keep in mind so that we know how we are harming the environment and can we benefit the environment in doing whatever we are doing
so, if try to look at the ratio of i line delta and this is i line star, i can say i line delta is equal to 3 three times i line star right
so, we will we understand what is input impedance, right
so i am going to do the remaining four problems of the assignment number six
so, in this particularly in that basic law we will see that application of this laws, and the technique will be your what you call restricted to only resistors circuit and several examples are presented
we could analyze the variance, we could find out the reason for that
then what is the role of function generator, what kind of signals it can generate, how it can be used
so let's write: i is equal to i one plus i two
what happens during the first cycle when the capacitance is not charged
whatever i told you tau is equal to you will get 0
then we have the warehouse charges, warehouse charges are say 500 rupees
so, if we know the composition of pore solution, and we know the concentration of various ionic species, we can calculate the saturation index for any phase
now, two terminal devices or elements which we discussed till now such as resistors, capacitors, inductors are called as a one port network
and if we have the converse, that is so whenever we want to design a band pass or band stop filter we have to keep this in mind
we define two terms: one is the radius of the spanning tree and the other is the cost of the spanning tree
so, by carefully observing these views we can imagine that, may be the block the basement might look like that and because this inclination thing and because of this, it might be something like it goes in that way where the views tell us something like a flat base is there
this will come up as rupees 6513
certainly, before discussing the restricted types of inheritance, we were not we did not have to discuss this, because if you look into just the first column, since the inheritance is the list restrictive inheritance is the provides the list encapsulation, therefore, the visibility of the data members or the member functions in a derived class is simply same as their visibility or visibility in the base class
now we will discuss about that before we move to the practical part where we start doing some small mini cases of learning about preparing the budgets, that is the quarterly budgets or maybe six monthly budgets or the annual budgets
if it is not none, it is not empty
this is where i have assumed the diode to be on, which means that the diode voltage is
so, we can have a p side is ec ev and the fermi level lies within the valence band similarly, can have a conduction side we can have the n side where the fermi level lies within the conduction band
can you think of any such item
but if you take a point here and a point here, they correspond to two storage elements but they are not directly connected
so, we have formed the junction between the metal and n type semiconductor and the junction is at equilibrium
5 so it was very much required to readjust the standard in the light of actual output and now there should not be any variance once we have revised the standard so in this case once you have calculated now the standard cost we have the standard cost of standard material is 1531 and the standard cost of the material is actual cost of the material is 1660
this one it is crest factor right of a sine wave maximum value by rms value
so, in this particular case, you have oxygen that is located approximately 400 milli electron volts or 0
people have done the same method with multiple emotional states
this way you have to make it or other way, you have to make it v is equal to your slope m into t plus c right
so, we saw that for a series resonator, our input impedance should be low
so, to start examining in plain strength, we now examining the in plain strength of a masonry wall and again in a way similar to the different zones that we examined in the failure plane which was the end result of application of the manmuller criterion
the income statement will be complete after addition of the interest expense, which is compounded after the cash budget has been prepared
5 is equal to is equal to what you can do is i am just showing you that before showing this one suppose look at this look at this diagram
so, any job should be able to run to completion in one of the frames
so, there is no confusion
the value of the capacitance is given by this expression
the very first circuit sensing at the drain and feeding back to the gate, this is what we had
it brings us to another aspect of body language and that is the precautions which we should take while facing an interview on skype
so, once it is done, use control button, hold that line
he is moving
the laminations are usually 0
there are many layers of wires because wires are not necessarily on metal, like in this diagram, as you can see, some of the wires are on metal, some are on diffusion and some are on poly silicon
if the switch is closed for long time means, this switch was closed for long time right and that t your what you call t is equal to 0, the switch is just opened otherwise it was close
supposing i tell you that the number of points at which i want to evaluate my function is fixed n points you have no choice over it; can you somehow give me a answer that is accurate to a higher order of polynomial
so, it becomes easier to use it in that way
so, the title emphasises the importance of both algorithms and data structures as components of effective programs
this is easy to do, if we could only remember the sub problems that we have solved before, then all we have to do is look up the value we already computed rather than recompute it
so i can either increase the delays of the gates like t, v, i or i, can increase the delays of the nets, t, e, i
i hope your question is somewhat clarified, if not completely
so, in the case of a series motor again n is equal to k dash v minus i a r a and r s is the series field resistance where you have to add r s divided by phi
so, you know source is expensive or detector is expensive and all of those things, then at some point you will be like as well do mri right
so this is generally known as tachogenerator mechanism
i was shifting my input data at one end and they were going through all of them one by one
the views whatever we obtain we call that as either first angle projection or the third angle projection
and managing the cost is best possible under the market costing because you know how much is the variable cost which is a controllable component of the total cost and you will focus upon that and you would like to control it
however, the dcdc converter, switched mode, have become very, very popular and they have improved in quality and performance over the years
the percentage of shareholding of promoters is 45%
any good model of the transformer can be used without loss of generality now this portion of the circuit as you already know is the core resexed rewheeling circuit we have a resistor and the diode and this is of course the input and we are applying 15 volts dc here on the secondary side we have the diode d1 and d2 and lc and you can recognize the buck converter topology in the output side
so, this is part a, now let us go to part b
so, if you see, what do you think looking at this picture, where is the silicon boule should be made
when operated in an open loop condition, it must be nulled or the device may get saturated, right
namaskar, so today we will start our last topic of the course that is analogous system
so, for that, in the public, you introduce a static member function
so, you have to find out v c t v 0 t i 0 t
the next type of 2 port device that i was mentioning was a discontinuity
now, my objective is to take two names of a person fname standing for the first name lname standing for the last name and to compose the total name by concatenating the lname after fname
the others are subsets of these
so, another way is v and vplus equals to vminus equals to 0 that is also true
we will first show how we can connect a bluetooth module with the microcontroller board
perhaps they are disposing of their investments
in free space epsilon r is 1 now what i will do is, i will make it 1 minus j something right
so, hope i have not missed any branch or anything hope everything is correct i believe right
they could also be declaratory suits which can come as a part of the enforcement function of an ip centre
small right so, i can approximate this as r and i can ignore this term which is going to be very small and alright ok
illustrators include behaviors to point out outline a form or depict a motion
so, you will get the circuit like this
just to know the expenses and income of a household also, if proper financial statements are prepared, then that becomes advantages
these infill panels are typically used within reinforced concrete moment resisting frames or steel moment resisting frames and are conceived as functional partitions
and the larger triangular faces that is on horizontal plane
0 remember
so if you want to make a random know, recollection attempt the information will not will be readily available to you
it is a prima facie evidence of proprietorship of the trademarks
now there are more advanced functions like log, square root, sin and all which are also built into python, but these are not loaded by default
for and these surface models they do not have any thickness, they are infinitesimally small in thickness, their length, breadth, this height, this kind of things matters, but not the thickness
so you include this and now you simulate and see what are the effects on the various waveforms
so, they appoint their representatives which are known as board of directors, which are elected every year
so, this we said is the copy construction
what we understood is that a electron beam evaporation is a physical vapor deposition that allows the user to evaporate materials that are difficult or impossible to process using resistive thermal evaporation, we have just seen an example some of these materials include material such as gold, titanium right some ceramics like silicon dioxide alumina, but if you generate if you find a material you find a boat which has a higher melting point of a boat is way higher than melting point of material and material can be grown, there material can be gold, that material can be nickel, that material can be any chrome right
that is in ampersand 'logical and' if i say a, if i write this expression, then this logical and has a behavior that if this part of the expression gets false then it does not evaluate the second part
retailing has major contribution in economic development
so, x1 minus x2 right and v is equal to i into z that is i into r plus jx and r and x are defined here right
so, this there will be an integral minus over e 1, the derivative here is positive 1 by delta for w prime, u prime which terms will appear go back over here u 1 which two terms will appear
if you were to design this as an unreinforced masonry wall or check if an unreinforced masonry wall is feasible, then the lateral seismic force should be different because the r factor that you would use for an unreinforced masonry typology will be different
so, the overall construction gives us the front view looks like an inclined one and the top view makes this obscured kind of pyramid
so, then what is this current what is this current flowing through this branch suppose this is your i 1, this is your i 2, and this is your i 3
we are not going to pay in the month of this generally but let's make the column here so that you can fill the figure here when it is going to be purchased
so, in that case we again use normal vector in terms of p 1, p 0; taking a cross product with p 2, p 0 points
this may look like a simple question; an invention will look how it is meant to look
in this problem very naively i am going to say far field is when kr is much much greater than 1 ok
6, i could not have meant this function g, even though g has one parameter, even though g has a type parameter type which is double, which is the type of 5
now, for those who have studied a computer science data structure, you will know that any such tree this is a binary tree with some operators in the vertex notes and some modules, in this case in the leave notes
so, so, this is your ah applying kcl at node 2, you applying kcl here also , current i 1 is entering and node 2, i 3 is leaving and 5 i 1 also this is dependent current source it is also leaving, right
62 x 1016cm 3
it should be because while you are copying, you do not want the right hand side to change
now, let us see the transfer function development for say simple liquid level system where you have some steady state flow q which is going inside the tank, the water is flowing and suppose there is a small change in the inflow rate from its steady state value which will cause the small change in the head from a steady state value
in a work environment we would always find that it is the boss, who moves around using these type of thumbs, protruding from his coat pocket
you know we have done in the lectures that electromagnetic radiation carries momentum and whenever it strikes a surface that momentum is going to be transferred and that exerts a force or develops a pressure
so, this is the currenti that is no load current i 0
so electric field at the eat, the inner cylinder surface, is going to be mu zero over two k dot a and e at the outer cylindrical surface is going to be mu zero over two k dot b
firstly, a reverse logic value must be applied to x
so, instead of going into more features of python of which there are many that we have not described
our delhi metro and all that are using actually regenerative breaking because we do not want to lose out so much of energy
this terminal and this terminal of the resistor, these are in series
so the overhang portion of the conductor is not going to be useful as far as the electricity generation is concerned or torque production is concerned because this is preview of the magnetic field
while examining all these typologies, i think it is important to point out two typologies that you will come across in existing buildings
if i am calling it with a, then a and x become alias
so in case of hsfg bolt, apart from shearing bearing and tension, prying force may also come into picture
now, i will connect this directly to the induction motor, so i am going to show as though this is connected here, this is connected here this is connected here i can connect a voltmeter if i want here, of course, i should have connected an ammeter which i missed, of course, ammeter should come definitely
then gamma in or theta equal to zero, this will a straight cut short and so that in that case gamma in at theta equal to zero will be equal to gamma l
you have two half cells of the battery, one becomes the anode, the other becomes the cathode, and then current flows between the two
you can simply turn off only the independent sources
and another approximation frequently used is that because the reverse bias current is so small, this value of bias is quite small and again when i say small compared to currents you normally see in forward bias
i 2 is nothing but i 3, this is i 3 plus 3 into i naught because these are coming inside the node and i 2 is going outside the node
now, before proceeding further i mean i will come to that when the wave will reach at the end of this your what you call at the capacitor end, at that time you know that when it reaches capacitor will be where this short circuit right and when it will reach the steady state it will act as open circuit
it consists of an input source
so, this is a printf which then prints the various aspects it prints a pointer, it prints the size and it determines whether there is it is in use or not in use
so for general clock routing, the consideration is that so all operations are typically synchronous with respect to a clock signal and if we can minimize skew, so we can use the fastest possible clock
so, what we are saying is when the sheer strength of the horizontal bed joint is reached, failure occurs in this unit motor assembly that we are examining at this state and defining the local states of stresses
this amount of current that flows into input pins of the bias and resistor are called input bias currents that are called input bias currents
so, that was the complex problem which could address almost all kind of the material variances related problems
this is the maximum emf generated, right
but after the entire outer circle is over, we come back to the central evaluate phase and here we do what is called summative evaluation where we actually plan how to figure out whether our e learning is effective
it is given in the case if you read it carefully is given to us that minimum cash balance required is $25,000 to be maintained all the times
you would agree with me that in any manufacturing process 50 to 55 percent or 60 percent cost is because of the material
so one, four, one, three
so the main objective behind these clock routing algorithms is to minimize this skew, which means how to distribute my clock signal such that, from the clock source down to the sink, how i can ensure that my inter connection lengths are all equal in length
we will also connect the input and we will also connect the outputinput
that is when you actually invoke the operator there is no int that you are going to pass it is just there in the signature
similarly, construct the next perpendicular bisector from pb
you probably never find out if his clothes have stitched well or not
so, expression for energy transferred it is actually 24 joule, i think this is simple thing it is understandable to all of you right slowly and slowly you have to understand now each and everything
now, what the trademark regime did at the international event it brought in harmonization, because more than anything else brands are constantly traveling from one country to another, even before we had say the company the mercedes benz as a company or an enterprise set its foot in india, they already had their products being sold and serviced here
so as we saw in the very first stages have been for a long time now we have been seeing that design thinking in this course has four stages
so, instead of using 4 ics which is single op amp, you can use one single ic which are all 4 op amps integrated into one single ic
this is the overall board you can see
so, for specific assets like mines or like oil wells, the exhaustion is a major reason for depreciation
silicon dioxide is written here right grey colour light grey next step
in these activities what we‘ve done is we have gone through a set of task flows which might which that customer might be going through in his routine activity
5, i can multiply both of them by 10, no 4, i have to multiply by 4, then i will be able to get essentially the same base 22 ohms, so 0
this leaves two slots open for the second queen, but wherever we put, whichever of the two we put, it will block the other one
now, for example, if it is positive, no issues because that closing balance of june will become the opening balance of july and we are in a very comfortable position
therefore a series rlc your series rlc circuit at resonance stores a constant amount of energy right
now by chance if let us say the payload is trying to execute from that particular stack then an exception get raised and the code will terminate
so, let us be very clear what determines which one is 0, which one is 1 which one is 2
but if gate time is not known precisely say we know this gate time to be half second, but say it is actually 0
that could be a problem statement
so, i got curious and i said, : can i find out what is it that he is doing
so, this is my x 1 is equal to 0 right
it is on that that you will have to calculate the shear capacity if you are considering a coulum type criteria
1 e v so e g is if, we plug in that, we get a value of n i to be 1 times 10 to the 16 per meter cube
this thing you should keep it in your mind right
the second one is direct creation of surface with manipulation of the surface poles and control points and a computational advantage when people started using these computers or trying to use packages
so, it will immediately open this gate and the next phase what you will see, this is this is this will remain close, but this green gate is now open and this cell would not move
in procedure 1 we were first making an assumption that compression controls and then check whether that assumption is true for the depth of neutral axis that is estimated and then if not make changes to the way the neutral axis depth is calculated and then arriving at the area of steel that is required
so i should be able to draw it like this, okay
the default value is provided in the function definition and if that parameter is omitted, then, the default value is used instead
it actually draws some power from the and converts it into additional power in the loudspeaker
so, in this case the energy is on the y axis the reference an energy level called 0 which is the vacuum level
so i have done the hard work
so, again and again i will not come to the circuit, but everything is marked
so if i neglect this value as it is negligible then i can find out the value of izz as 346
now, price upon sales ratio, this is referring to market prices
6 times the full load torque right
its ok
so, because of which we are actually looking at the field flux control, only meant for above rated speed operation but the torque being below the rated torque value
so inappropriate retrieval strategies being used or if because you know that information is stored in an organized order go for a random search okay you are not able to retrieve the information so this could be the possible reasons of loss of information from long term storage there are two more interesting things about memory we will talk about one right now the reconstructive aspect of the memory
it is a very harsh product, it reduces the, say, life of the product, quality of the product, but since there is no alternative available in the market and the product of the hul or the hl was really not within the reach of the people as far as the price was concerned, so they were bound to use the castic soda
our line if there is a point this is the point 20 metres above hp
so, the unit impulse may be regarded as an applied or resulting shock and visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area
second device is a sensor with a micro heater, on which was an insulator, on which were inter digitated electrodes, on which was sensing film
so when both are switching together the effect is the least
so, if we want to implement this circuit, what is the first step
so, for one share, i will copy it here
in the previous lectures i have specifically shown you how we will be using stm board and here i will take you through the steps that are required to use arduino uno board, which is again fairly very straightforward
so, the flux created by this coil will be 0
similarly, in a face to face setting you would have experienced group discussions or debates perhaps some structured learning activities, structured peer learning activities, such as collaborative problem solving, jigsaw, think pair share and so on
so, we took a very detailed look in terms of what c provides, what is the lacunae they are in and in view of that we try to understand the basic semantics of try throw catch exception clauses and how does the c++ provide that
8 millimeter to the cube and area we can find out this is as 100 into 9
now, we have got the thevenin voltage, we have got the thevenin resistance so using this formula i n is nothing but v th upon r th you get again the value of norton's current as 1 ampere and this is what we calculated when we directly applied the norton's theorem
you require that the masonry unit, the code requires that the masonry unit has a minimum strength of 7 megapascals, right
and then we will continue the circuits of op amps in the next lecture
so, if you look into this problem that your power factor is given 0
so, what is the standard proposition of these workers
the reflection quiz based on the weeks lxi can be found immediately after the lxi in the same unit for the corresponding week
so if i try to apply a larger voltage it is definitely not good for the machine especially if i do it for prolong periods of time
so, hopefully this is familiar to all of you the idea of a secondary wave front from which now the rest of the, once i get the secondary wave fronts i can forget about the primary excitation and i get this excellent agreement between theory and experiment to explain the interference ok
after this what will get
so, now, that is called a dorsal view
so, you turn on the bulb, wait for 2 seconds, turn off the bulb, wait for 5 seconds in a repeated while loop
yes, you have to multiply by the volume also but if i look at the overall energy that is associated with the air gap although the volume is really really small, generally the energy associated with the air gap is going to be outweighing whatever is the energy associated with the iron core
i'm not going to put the controller in detail and just going to say this is b not trap
since a is in only phi direction and i also know that the final answer is in the z direction
but the problem comes when you have good quality infill panels, panels which are constructed well strong in comparison to the lateral strength of the frame itself
so with this you can say that the maximum operating frequency with skew and jitter will be one by this
the next would be based on the frequency, right
so, the capacitance between the inverting terminal and the ground or non inverting terminal and ground, typically has a value equal to 1
now so, this is another arrangement and observe that when i change the position of the switch ok
so, then from here, i can find out zin as equal to and this comes out to be
so, for one share they are able to generate 417 millions million sales
earlier my function that i was doing expressing using pulse basis function was discontinuous
now, side view, you can see that for connection you need to drill holes like this m one to take connection, you have to have a connection like this from this drain
what we have seen so far is l dot sort, which is the function which takes a list and updates it in place
so, power p is nothing but i x v, which can be written as v x –i1000, so we have i1000+ioexp⁡
so, when we press the first button, first is your frequency, and another one is your period
i will show you what will do with tm polarization
there can be multiple cells verying with
6 degrees
typically, in the passive mode or the output of this logic will be 0 in which case it acts as a regular 4 to 1 multiplexer depending on the values of s1 and s2, one of these inputs a, b, c and d would get switched to the output m
these are the standard textbooks what we use
but here i am applying if rated, it is generating rated voltage and i am going beyond that right, i have come from 0 to if rated, i have minimized the field when i started the short circuit test i have increased it slowly
so, if i am establishing the flux only from the rotor side, which is sufficient enough at this juncture, it does not have to draw anymore magnetising current from the stator side
now this attack works very well with the older systems like the intel core 2 duo and so on but with modern systems like the i7 like we are going to have here as well as the i3 and i5 processors the attacks are not very successful
tthe phase of the signal, and right now is 15 degree, 16 degree
i can in fdtd i can specify a source after that what supposing my task someone gives me structure and says find out the resonate frequency of the structure
this is a space shuttle, a reusable space vehicle
now it is a complicated name for a simple concept
now, i am going to have my induction motor here just to differentiate between these two, let me probably draw the induction motor winding, again i have showing it in star it need not be in star it can be in delta as well, so this how it is going to be, so this is actually the stator and here is the rotor
so, you can imagine that that would have led to a lot of work starting from the 1900s
ok, and the sat solvers that are available today many of them are freely available they run very fast and then can handle quite large number of variables, thousands of variables, they can handle
so, 18 into 1000; so that means, i 1 is equal to all the data are given, so it will be 24 ampere right
so, by convention claims are written in one sentence
here we do the same thing using the array p s array which is the array of the function pointers that can be used
so, you take the derivative of your what you call ah your for t greater than 0, you take the derivative of this equation that dv t by dt for this 1 for t greater than 0
the effective mass of the electron m e star is 0
in the interpreter there is a useful function called type
the third division that is the experimental psychology division which is basically a society for experimental psychology and cognitive science and it does know takes care of the development of experimental psychology as a science the fifth division
so we are going to have this construction the cross sectional view i have shown here
so the basic idea is something like this
those who are interested you can type subprime crisis in google, lot of articles will come and you will get more information
so, everything is written the
so, at t is equal to 3, second say it is switched off switched on and t is equal to 6 it is switched off
difference in speech rate causes problems in understanding the intended message, therefore the speed should always focus on the audience and then the speaker should be able to introduce variations in the speed
so, there is a sort of trick short hand trick you can use to remember this the e x derivative can be thought of as top minus bottom, right the top value minus the bottom value
you should be able to make multiple copies of it
so, for first case, field current was 1 ampere 250 upon 250 and in the second case, circuit the figure a the field current i f 1 will be 250 upon 251 ampere, but second case, i f 2 will be 250 upon r plus f r f
core type construction always enhances air surrounding air more, where it makes it more
because his profit to a larger extent depends upon if he is able to serve the larger number or the largest number of the customers
so in the limit everything is well behaved because this is giving me the ratio omega by k equal to c right, so life is good this is what we expect
so here victim is driven by a gate that is driving noise
so, the left hand side space is what would be called, what would be called the this the space on the left hand side
in the explicit calculation we know that field outside is e due to a dipole
now, let us try to find out the values of these admittance parameters individually
now before i get into that one general principle we will derive
hence one can easily calculate the voltage stability index of each node that is m 2 is equal after load flow studies all the results are known voltage magnitude and p m 2 and q m 2 all are known for m 2 is equal to 2 3 up to n b n b is the total number of nodes
take a simple material and i have m varying
what they are showing whether they are showing a thermal sensor, where you can see a person in night
but if you are given a save command and at the same time you are able to also do editing and other operations, then it's a asynchronous i
we will use that same delay capacitance delay model, that shown earlier
so, based on those line representation we will be in a position to understand what type of material we are using
so, this is the main line carrying the current i 1 and here, we can have the metre or so, ok
and for using the 14 digital input output pins, we need to know the following functions: one is spin mode, another is digital read for reading the input, digital write to write the value into the port
but now, we have a junction where you have a forward bias, which means the fermi level of the semiconductor will be shifted up
ok, fine, so lets take an example
so, let us make it 20 units, click ok
so, if we were to look at this wall as a ground story wall in a multi storied building, then i can regulate the pre compression level based on what is the expected pre compression level in the ground story wall
then we will look at actually voltage regulation and efficiency along with phasor diagrams also, because some phasor diagrams will be needed for the calculation of you know voltage regulation, not for efficiency but definitely for voltage regulation we will need that, right
outside the domain; obviously, because it is a non invasive method i cannot go inside the domain and measure field
so in the module, in this module 7, we have introduced the concept of reference in c++ and we have studied the difference between call by value and call by reference
now, next is the condition when you set v 2 is equal to 0 that means you are keeping output port short circuited that means you will set the value of v 2 in these two equations as 0 so b which you will get from the first equation is minus of v 1 upon i 2 and d you will get from the second equation that is equal to minus of i 1 upon i 2
so, here you get a rise of about 0
and one another type of launcher or transition that is frequently used, especially when you are going from 2 conductor waveguide to a single conductor waveguide
because of which i will have probably this magnetic field corresponding to the stator is exactly passing through the rotor and then you know completing itself through the yoke
so, we can write x1s is nothing but laplace of the integration from t naught to t x2 d tau and plus x1 t naught by s
now, a list of balances related related to incomes and expenses are given and from that we have to make income statement
so, would it be correct to draw something like this
but in a second case you will see the lines are mostly local, confine to the channels and only a few connections are across channels
5 volts because otherwise the m1 may go into triode region or m1 will go out of the desired region and it has to be greater than minus 0
these findings are from a 2007 survey and since that we find that the presence of technology has only been enhanced
as there is no physical connection between inverting terminal and ground, this is also called virtual ground
then here it is encountering minus terminal so, minus 2 and here it is entering minus your what you call ah terminal
so, how this silicon wafer can be obtained
so, that can also not be a front view
but, in that case computation will efficiency may be less in couple newton raphson method, but here we are exploiting the radiality of the network and based on that, we are developing the algorithm
i am mingling the two, i better take precautions
so, you can say factory depreciation in the bracket you can write it as a plant or you can state way write the plant depreciation
so, if it is moving with this angular velocity, then what will happen then these two sides are actually intersecting or cutting through these flux lines
that the oscillator which uses the elements l, that is inductor; l c that is capacitor, to produce oscillations are called lc oscillators
now if you just rearrange this by taking v2i2 to the other side, you will easily see that minus v2 i2 is less than or equal to v1i1
so, this will have to be known in mind and a final observation is what if i wrote my copy constructor like this and what if i passed the object to copy from as a parameter to the constructor copy, constructor with call by value mechanism and not call by reference
now you see here below 151 hertz, below 159 hertz it will again start increasing
as i said this is vcc, which is connected to this one, this is gnd, which is connected to the ground port of the stm board
thus the output waveforms looks like one shown here right
in the last classes, we have seen parabola will be constructed when a section parallel to one of the slant edges; if we are going to construct it, take a section, then we will be in a position to construct a parabola
so, let us see what happens ok
it is supposed to draw a non sinusoidal magnetizing current, but it is forced to draw sinusoidal magnetizing current
now you are left with the question of what should be the return type, what should it return, should it just return a void
the other requirement of an algorithm is that we must get the answer after a finite number of steps
so, there will be some cost for the asset and we are assuming that there is an economic value which can be measured and if exact value is not known at least it can be estimated
next, let's look at surface elements, surface area elements perpendicular to r, perpendicular to theta and perpendicular to phi
so, but still the assumption is that if they woke up early, they would be on time to the class
if the form x which we are talking about is selling for 13 rupees may be possible that more customers are inclined towards the product of this firm
you are again looking at clay brick unit compressive strength on the x axis, megapascals on the top and the prism compressive strength on the y axis
a, which is given as a, x, y, z is equal to two x, x plus two y, y minus three z, z
next is series and parallel inductors right
there i have to do the singularity little bit carefully, but it is not a problem because is green’s function we know has an integrable singularity
that is 250,000 plus 2,500
so, you have paid cash, cash will go down, it will appear as a credit transaction
if we do that, for instance, we get, let me substitute that in here, if rs is 0, we will have gm rg rl minus rl and in the denominator we will only have rl plus rg
now what do you mean by dividend yield
and similarly b your receiving end side it is z r minus z c upon z r plus z c
so, here, your direction is from reflected one from right to left this side is minus v f
so, we are done with horizontal kind of ellipse
everything that goes into the production of the cement including the extraction and transportation of the fuel taking the material out, crushing the material transporting it to the plant and everything that is involved in production of electricity because electricity is needed for different aspects for running the plant for turning the kiln for the grinding and crushing and so on
so, the samples were pre corroded and then we try to apply cathodic protection
5 into fcd value is 114
both of these at typically selected randomly
so, this is how you would start, i mean this is how you would solve problem with a perfect metallic conduct i mean perfect electric conductor ok
now if we compare it with calcium aluminate,right, which is the main phase of calcium aluminate cement, the carbon dioxide footprint is quite low
and the difference is that say in the absorption costing we take into account the total cost, variable plus fixed after that we come to the profit but in case of the marginal costing we don't follow the concept of profits to state way
people also say sometimes when, if, if you are caught on a thunder storm, go inside a car which is made of metal, then you will be shelled it in any distributors outside and this is also known as faraday's cage
it may severely affect the functionality of that, but in case if we are going to make it a smaller one this this is small size, but this one large it just comes out of that object
therefore, it is wrong
and that maintains a specified voltage between these 2 terminal between this terminal it is your, this voltage is specified right between this 2 terminal right
so, you can see that the power it this e cross h term over here e cross h star can be real can be imaginary right and we will have both parts the complex number
92 determine the following the capacitor size required
delta not is equal to
so, we looked at materials, we looked at simple materials which used ohm’s law right and after that
so, i am integrating over the primed coordinates ok
so, this position indicates 10 milliampere, this is 0 ampere ok
so, some transient imbalance will be there
i may supply the voltage until maybe, you know if there are 1000 turns i may actually supply the voltage only until 980 turns
yyou have to find what is fh and what is f fl, right
if a member function is not virtual, and it is redefined in the derived class as we have say then the latter definition will hide or suppress mask the former definition
then you try to identify the criticality of the nets, which of the nets are critical, give them higher weights, so whenever you place them, give priority to the higher weights of the nets, right, ah
so, i really do not have to take that into consideration, when 10 ampere is flowing through the primary winding, this may be 0
in that case the projection on the vertical plane a’ b’ gives us only the apparent length, not true length whereas, it is projection on the horizontal plane gives us complete information of that line
shear behavior, the deformation capacity is significantly lower and that's why the ultimate drift is about 0
these are the four operations of stack empty top push and pop in c given as global functions
so, again it is moving, again will come when a will come to this and b will come to this
so, if you're comparing the outcomes of the design, which would be the structural system, using different codes, you have to be clear of the philosophy that is adopted as far as the structural design is concerned from one country to another
so you can see in the figure the xs is the input to the block having transfer function f1s
so, initializing the data members of udt will also need the existence of a copy constructor without that a data member of that corresponding type cannot be defined
so, when r prime belongs to v 1 you do not recognize it yet, but this is actually nothing, but huygens’s principle ok
now let us look at a particular and very simple fault attack where an attacker could determine 1 bit of a that is 1 bit of the private key a
so if i want to refer to this as a phasor then what i can do is i can try to look at the projection along this axis and try to plot it, for example i am looking at time t equals to 0, at that point i am having 0 value, if i look at corresponding to say 30 degree point, this is 30 degree, i am going to have half the value of the peak, so i can actually project this as though a vector is rotating continuously with respect to time, so when i had time t equals to 0 if i actually specify this vector somewhat like this
so, when we will continue subsequently with trying to solve this equation using the fem framework clear so far
if there is nothing, it will be straight away connected in that way
problem is little difficult, because what happens now
so, we will have to be careful in dealing with that
a value of 0 in this file indicates that aslr is disabled on this system
so let us see now if i have a ring which carries current i, alright, now if i solve for b del cross, b equals mu naught j, then b on the z axis is in the z direction and it is given, as we've already seen it just now, mu naught i divided by two, radius being r square, r r square plus z square, raise to three by two
this question actually is not so simple while our intuition says that assignment should always copy the value
we get the 2 and 3, 5
once you start investing money into patenting then the money is like it will incur expenses not just in the form of prosecution and registration, but also after registration they could be money that is required to keep the patent alive through renewals; there will be renewal fees
so, this is what we are doing and then we got basically w0 equal to v0 i0 cos phi 0
and we will see in a minute what a tuple is
and of course, we will not study ac transient as far as your as far as i can say that first year engineering syllabus is concerned right
so, the maximum number of variables that can appear in an equation is 5 right 1 common plus 2 from the other 2 from the other 5 right
so, it makes life simple also this is the two cases, but we will not use this perpendicular and parallel notation, we will just use te tm ok
let me talk about what is a microcontroller board
based on the orientation or based on the primary flat and secondary flat, we are talking about primary flat and secondary flat
current source will become 20 angle minus 90 degree divided by 5 that is the resistance so it will become 4 angle minus 90 degree or in complex form you can write is is equal to minus j 4 ampere and this current source will be in parallel with 5 ohm resistance
so, if we are rotating this horizontal plane by 90 degrees would like to show the projections what we do is, first we locate a', b', a'
i hope i have made myself clear
at the right most boundary so, there are the scatterers are to always to a left of this boundary
and now we have within the point, we have these two attributes x and y, means every point looks like this
the task scheduling support, it's seen the task scheduler is a central aspect of any real time operating system, and therefore the real time operating system should support task schedulers like rate monotonic scheduler, earliest deadline first scheduler, and other custom task schedulers
so, as we have already seen that modeling of passive electrical elements we have discussed resistors, inductors and capacitors
now one thing is clear: that there is a majority major part of this net
now input signal is applied for inverting terminal, let us see configuration using ideal op amp, alright
so, parts per million is 10 to the minus 6, parts per billion was 10 to the minus 9
so, both the cases element actually is absorbing the power right
c is given; f c is given; then r will be one upon 2 pi f c into c, i substitute the value and for the value of r, we know that r1 should be equal to 1 or r2 should be equal to r1
so, this is the fermi dirac statistics and this tells you what is the probability of occupation of a given energy state as a function of a temperature
so, how to target the problem
so, the order in which you supply the things to format does not matter
let us create a string which as whitespace before and afterwards, so let us put some spaces may be a tab and then the word hello and then two tabs
so, i can also write down kx can be written in terms of cos and sin
so what we did mention was that this particular cache memory had a cache line size of 64 bits which would indicate that the lowest bits of the address, the lowest 6 bits of the address comprises addressing within the cache line size which is of 6 bits
so, i will it will be discussed in i mean not in detail in brief at first year level some ideas we will get right
so, here it is it is 0 for t less than 0, and it is v s 1 minus e to the power minus t by tau for t greater than 0, this is equation 50 right
in fact just from symmetry we can write down directly what will be s 2 2 if s 1 1 is given by this expression s 2 2 will be something like this
now if you compare the normal mode of operation versus the sgx enabled mode of operation we see that an attacker could have attacked either the application os, virtual machine or the hardware in order to gain access to that secret key
now you could assume that the wall has zero tensile strength or assume that fmt is a finite value
we will try to analysis the circuit and try to find out the currents which are there in the various branches of the network and the voltage across the components
textbooks, notebooks and another thing would be my account basically where user would usually go login into the system
lets say: this is your v d d metal line, this is your ground line
the way i write personally is i write a word i draw flowcharts to around that word, then try to make up the whole lecture in flowcharts or couple of words itself and then make up the whole lecture for myself looking at those words
so these are the two signals which we have computed
i'll be applying a force in the opposite direction
so, vth upon rth plus rl would be the value of current i and then the square of that is i square and then multiplied by rl would be the total value of power which would be delivered to the load
so, we have to keep in mind that not all circuits can be converted into the equivalent z parameters to a few of them are like we discussed with the help of ideal transformer example
so if you want to express it as a percentage, multiply this by hundred
566 and as we have to take atleast 0
after seven iteration it will be even less, and so on
so, when i swap star x and similarly star y, it is actually b
answer is no, you cannot
when i say a forward problem what do i mean that, you know your given the permittivity let us say your also given the e incident
h naught
suppose there is one line surge impedance or characteristic impedance is z c 1 and line is bifurcated here and this surge impedance of this line this side is z c 2, this is also z c 2
so, we started developing the other anodes that we could put into holes, and drill holes you can put in a grid formation like this
so, we have found the value of v naught
so, we can change this; however, we will have to right click this and select float
so, deception or deceptive similarity or something that could deceive people still remains at the centre or still remains the focal point of trademark law
02 second, right
5 this alpha value is the imperfection factor that is 0
the first two inputs are going from one to zero at time, t equal to zero
contiguity is the nearness
please understand the moment i say it is over hauling torque that means this has going to be a negative torque because we are talking about breaking
so, you use a gaussian current
w 1 w 2 and w 3 and interesting thing this thing you have intentionally taken the this load is unbalanced because z a is simply 15 ohm , similarly z b is 10 plus j 5 ohm and z 6 minus j 8 ohm
then we found out that say the fixed cost was expected to remain the same
so because of which you are going to have all these three as co phasal because 360 degrees is actually you know you are not going to have any phase shift at all, so if you look at the third harmonic for a phase, third harmonic for b phase, third harmonic for c phase
then sketching h t minus lambda is the key to the convolution process because it involves reflecting h lambda about the vertical axis and shifting it by t
the same thing i am expecting, that you should bowl like this, you should catch like this, you should bat like this
it is not like saying that a heap implementation is always better than a sorted list implementation for a priority queue
so, a is spending much more on cost of goods sold
now is when we go to the discrete world
the usage of visuals must supplement the e learning content so, as to maximize learning for the learners
now i am going to describe the evolution of the push pull converter using the forward converter
secondly let us go to the next example here we will see in the examples of what i was saying till now, split attention there is too much of text on screen, your audio is playing i can see the audio down, i cannot even shut that
now design process so design process as we have calculated earlier here also we will get similar magnitude like 2
theta is the angle between the z axis and r and therefore you can immediately see that cosine of theta is going to be given by z over r or z over square root of x square plus y square plus z square
the resistance r g is variable that means, this resistance r g is variable between 2 and 55 ohm that means r g actually that means, if you write like this that means that means, your r g is lying in between these two, and 55 ohm right
so, what do i need to talk about
why do you want this
now the process of over learning basically means that you keep on keep on keep on repeating it to an extent that the whole process becomes automated, okay
the other line what we are going to use is now we have this point, this point, maybe i would like to remove this part of the curve here
so this is going to like this: what about if i take a symmetry place wire on the other side
the fermi level will shift from the center of the gap it will shift closer to the conduction band for an n type semiconductor and closer to the valance band if it is a p type semiconductor
so, area of this one right if it is rectangular 1, it is l into b
so, we made a stencil right, this stencil was the yee cell right and from here we got the so, called update equations which allowed us to step the fields in space and time
now, whenever we have a junction between 2 dissimilar materials, we said that there will be potential which depends upon the work function
module 02 lecture 13: conic sections v conic sections, there we have learned many things like a horizontal slice to a right circular cone gives us circle, slant edges gives us ellipse, further parabola, and hyperbola
iif you do n ot understand what is bnc connector is, just say multimeter probe or frequency generator probe, oscilloscope probe, right
and last thing that i will finish with one statement is that when you connect the inputs suppose you ok, let me say it in a different slide ok
but, what has been returned is a reference that is the address of x itself; the reference of x, which is an alias of x
it is just a scoping rule, class also does scoping, but it does scoping with class semantics
so, this would be short circuited and the same current will flow in the branch keeping other parameters same
so here, as i had said, we are not working at the circuit level, so we are looking at the design specification at a much higher level and by using a suitable state encoding, we are also able to minimize the switching activity even at this higher level, right
as far as the designation of the strength of the brick, it typically follows the compressive strength
array is a container; it is a collection of data items with the specific behavior that all items are of the same type as we have seen
so, if you all the everything is written here, but i will show you how we are making it
how much was the cash sales in the current month
so, it will it will be your what you call i 1 plus i 2
then on this 60,000, how, interest will work out at the rate of 10% and that interest if you work out at the rate of 10% on a amount of 61,000 rupees for a period of 3 months that amount works out as how much
so this integrator is like an eye control and you can also make a pi controller by also including a proportional part of the for this controller
ok, so design for testabilities are very important technique which is part and partial of chip design today
so what should be our so called performance driven design flow
for instance, supposing the task at hand is to prepare a hall for a function
of course, the serviceability limit state is the other aspect that needs to be considered and in this sort of a situation what we are really looking at at serviceability conditions is displacements for example
if you know the two 3db db frequencies, you can find out the value of ql and then once you know ql, you can use these equations that we just derived to find the values of the to design the resonator
that difference can be captured only if you use a nonlinear approach to estimate the response of the wall to lateral forces
there are several algorithms which are generic in terms of algorithmic strategy like finding maximum or minimum of two numbers or searching a set of data items which can be compared, but depending on the specific type their codes become different
the basic characteristics of a state variable formulation is that the linear and nonlinear systems, time invariant and time varying system
central executive, articulatory loop, and visual spatial sketchpad
now, it is much easier to measure experimentally the h parameters of such devices, then to measure their z and y parameters
often times what we see is, that we can respond 24 7 all the time, some people expect that some people would never expect that
so, next is example 5
in the next module, we will take up the other cast operators and move on
and then is the fixed expenses
so, if the box is placed at the first quadrant system in which if we are assuming another object is placed; something like this slot block
so what are the difference between network and circuit
the relation between the speed and the torque in each case can be found out right
in this case, offset is the best option to really go with
now, so what is the access specification issue
2 ghz broadcom 64 bit cpu, along with that it has got 1 gb of ram, wireless lan, bluetooth, ethernet and usb
so, instead of a waterfall design wherein you have certain steps and you go from step 1 to step 5 one after the other and then you have a closure
welcome to another module of this course ‘microwave integrated circuits’
but ideally the implementation should not be visible outside only the interface should allow the user to interact with the implemented data
so, if i want to just apply this trapezoidal rule to find out the whole integral from x 1 to x n, i just have to add the contribution for each of these segments correct
so this would give you a lot of insight into the rectifier circuit, rectifier filter circuit in cell
you are saying that between a and b, there is a big jump in direction
now, i would like to join that one with other one, again i click that one, click that point
while on the left side shows the corresponding assembly code that gets complied with canaries enabled
so, you can have bed joint reinforcement acting as shear reinforcement but they cannot be as effective as a construction where vertical steel is provided to account for good anchorage of the horizontal steel itself
so this is the diagram, so here
and therefore the magnetizing current rises up linearly like this
similarly, in the other example, what i did, i took a parallel plate capacitor and i said there is a current which is coming in which is i t
so, which means in this diagram this is equal to r i plus r meter and if i have anything else i am also including conductor resistance that may be negligible, but and if i have anything else in series
so, this is the work function of the platinum, this is the work function of molybdenum
so, this is your kvl so, that is minus 6 plus 2 into i because v is equal to ir, r is equal to 2 encountering plus terminal; so, 2 i here also plus terminal
now we know from this for t greater than 0 we know that i t is equal to i infinity plus i 0 minus i infinity e to the power minus t by tau right
so, in that case that you have to what you call just i told it passes through the neutral axis
what this means, for example if i have an entry, if the entry is let us say, arm, it means that this particular object file or executable was compiled for the arm processor
we write that down as h0 by l, this m by h, the ratio of the bending moment to the shear force expressed as h0, h0 by l, and therefore this expression for lc brings in the shear span ratio, shear span of the section of the wall itself, the shear ratio of the wall section itself
so, the user who has not tested the concrete is not really ensured of the quality, so there is always a benefit of doubt that we have to give to the user, there is also the always this unknown or the feeling that something could have gone gotten wrong
so even experts in finance could not understand what they have written there
we know we can write v+x in terms of the voltage at the source, vo like this
gesticulating with hands and other different types of hand and finger movements are relatively less seen in a country like england, where using ones hands too much during the speech is still considered to be inappropriate and rude
so, in this first demo we will actually look at the basics we will see how this stack is presented in a program and we will also uses a tool called gdb which can be used to actually debug these programs
so that is your now and another thing is the electromagnetic system is an essential element of all rotating electrical electric machines in our electrical engineering we see, and electro mechanical devices as well as static devices like transformer right
now 20,000 units were issued during the month and we have to determine the value of closing stock
as i have told you this is the usb port through which you can connect to the usb port of the pc
for forward let me take r2 dash by 2 and x2 dash by 2
once you realize that there is replication of finding people theorize it
if you see this one, this a, b and star, this i represent as first the two leave notes, then the operator on top a, b, star
so, when you see this symbol here right this is under root
5 and less than 84 so from this we can say that the section is plastic right so section is classified as plastic now we have to check for bending strength so bending strength we can calculate that is mdz as zpz into fy by gamma m0 zpz value was taken as 104
say in that h 2 minus h 1 is positive
so charging, discharging time will be the predominant delay here: charging the load capacitance and discharging the load capacitance, ok
so, with this you can simply calculate the value of p as a multiplication of voltage and current
maybe it's for a month, maybe for a quarter, for six months or say for your one year or even more than that, depending upon the type of the budget, how much we are going to sell in market
we will discuss security and other related the features as we go along in the next class, thank you
so, you have search algorithm, we have sort algorithm, we have min algorithm, we have average algorithm and so on
and in the third case, you have to look at the right part of the array
and if you can adjust the width of the channels, which in standard cell is possible, then hundred percent completion of routing is guaranteed, which is indeed a problem in general routing case, say
so the literature also refers to this test in some parts of the literature as conventional tensile strength test of masonry
so, what i do is, i take the ones which i have newly marked and add them to the queue saying that these are being newly marked
are now going to next two heads the next head is investing activities this also bit of we have discussed last time so all those activities which are related to long term assets like fixed assets or investments they would be included here in investing activities
so, each equation solved separately for each region ok
but if you are ah if it is your what you call, if it is more than ah 2 3 4 or 5 say something it count, then you have to follow certain techniques
so, the first equation will become curl of this write it in this form first let us write it del by del t of d ok
first of all we will have to calculate that how much is the cost of material, how much is the cost of labor and how much is the cost of the other direct expenses without which the production is not possible
i am only modifying ra, if i am increasing the armature resistance by including some external resistance i am going to have more and more drop in the form of ia ra drop
so that 1
when we are evaluating the content and at the same time, we think that this might be an important message either to us or more to the other person often we are talking to in addition to be associated with the evaluation of content
k is actually the constant, i cannot write this as ke because ke when we write, we write phi multiplied by omega
now of course i am sure all of you are familiar with this set of equations
so, now, if we measure the potential difference between this side, between this side and the other side which is behind which we cannot see, then we will see there is a potential difference
so, this is how we can create a virtually moving magnetic field without any physical object being moving ok
so this could include all he is notes and that textbooks for that relevant topic of study
then we will use the time shift property and we will write the laplace transform of the second term that will become f1 s e to the power minus t s
so, in this case r thevenin is for coming around 0
but we would like to utilize the maximum portion of the iron effectively
utilization due to t2 is 1 by 5 and utilization due to t3 is 5 by 20 which is 1 by 4
and another one was called the mesh and overlay system
it will be very fantastic to have a chip which can test itself and it can tell us that will i am good or i am bad, so i do not have to do any testing from outside
because of charging and discharging of the capacitor and inductor simultaneously and in opposite polarity; so, capacitor is positive then capacitor will charging the negative polarity upper plate and again it will discharge inductor will charge sorry magnetic energy a magnetic energy collapses; electro static energy again comes in to picture because capacitor again charges with opposite polarity
so, continuing plus discontinuing both the profit after taxes are added and you get the final result
so, we will give a title, this is a comparative statement
so, today we will continue our yesterday’s discussion on mesh analysis
this is what backtracking is all about, we keep trying to extend the solution to the next step if we cannot we undo the previous move and try again, and in this way we exhaustively search through all the possible solutions, but we do it in a systematic way we do not go back and randomly reshuffle some of the choices we made before we go back precisely one step and undo the previous steps
next is example 7, a 25 h p, that is horse power 6 pole, 50 hertz, slip ring induction motor runs at 960 rpm on full load with a rotor current at 35 amp of 35 ampere
if we want to open the older one, there is option like part1 2d
first term is a constant, so i get immediately l, l and l contribution from x, y and z and therefore i get l cubed from the first term plus for the second term
8 which is greater than the band gap of gallium arsenide which is 1
let us do that step by step on our drawing sheet
so, suppose if a machine is likely to be used for four years, in a productive and an efficient manner, it may have a total life of five years, but in the fifth year it may face with lot of accidents or possibility of more repairs
now, once you have written a differential element as it is called the next objective would be to find out what is the total change; let us say when i go from some point “a” vector to some point over here “b” vector
first let us see the qualitative qualitatively how does this circuit works
but, what i have passed is actually a function
so, once i have interdigitated electrodes then what is my goal
so, in general for mth term, you can simply say that it is k n minus m
so, generally power generation in three phase circuit nothing will be told here just giving you some flavor, because our objective is to study the three phase circuit analysis
6 has been encountered 8 different function headers or function definition has been seen by the compiler
if i have to calculate if i have to say it is vf whatever i am applying, vf is a dc voltage vf is a dc voltage and rf which is the field resistance
now for example when we manufacture different type of the products in the same machine, then what happens that sometime two products are not same in all respects
so, v 3 is equal to v 4 is equal to 50 volt right
so, when we look at metals we have conductivity or we have resistivity of around 10 to the minus 9 ohm meter
i will still see some output voltage in the output output we can measureoutput
so if i connect an n type and p type in parallel, then both zero and one will be transmitted without any degradation
17,000 plus 35,000
the first one is we always begin either with front plane, top plane or right plane
now, usually we give this the the sharp corners we avoid it by going with chamfering this chamfering we can go with 1 mm with 45 degrees
so, we have 5 x 1018 boron and 1016 arsenic atoms on the n side the whole life time values are also given
so, i will have a del squared let us call it e incident because there is nothing to scatter the field
so if i can take that decision early enough, then i can disable the remaining computation
so, here what you can say for node q
now, all these options being together in close proximity gives a feedback or gives a message to the users that they perform a similar function and that is where another example can just be useful in finding it out
i have already created a sample here
so, here if we are rotating that object by that certain angle; this one, we will be in a position to view; that one, we will be in a position to view
in therapeutic relationships a good eye contact is associated with a better and more successful recognition of psychological distresses in patients
because the resistance is a small it will just have all sorts of different directions of current flowing all over the core which is called as the eddy current
therefore the radial distance between this two will be same the angle between two forces will be same therefore the stresses the resultant stresses at this point and this point will be same
so, let me clear it, so
so you have concrete right at the top then you have bricks, road and payment materials, glass, wood and steel and we find that if you compare a unit weight of this different materials all of this being construction materials we find that concrete has the least embodied energy
what will taylor’s theorem can taylor’s theorem be used to give an approximation for first derivative of a function yes what should i do
on the other hand, if i now calculate the potential, which is a scalar quantity, calculating electric field becomes quite easy because i can just take the gradient of the scalar quantity and obtained the electric field on it
so, we should also know how they are made or how they work
81, your 98
line integral right the divergence theorem helps us to reduce one dimension
so, when it comes to undoing it for a instance, now we want to undo this particular thing now this when we put it had only one white square, there was no free squares other than this
so, i y 0, so this is 0 basically circuit remains only this part
and the projected sales are given to us on the right hand side about the past about six months, starting with april and ending with september
we saw in the case of silicon that n could be more than 7 or 8 orders of magnitude higher depending upon the dopant concentration, in which case sigma would just be n e mu e
now if a circuit has 2 or more independent sources the one way to determine the value of a specific variables that is may be voltage or current is to use nodal or match analysis, which we discussed in the previous week
what are your, where do you search for videos
so, the moment you give me delta t my delta x is fixed right
similarly, when we were calculating divergence and things like those, and when you use divergence theorem, we took surface area as a vector
so, which means that the c2 here is a right hand side operand which will become c and the c1 here is the current object which is star this
similarly, this distance is going to be h square plus r square, so the magnitudes of the forces of the same and by symmetry you can see, that they are horizontal components are going to be in the opposite directions and they are going to cancel and it is only the vertical component that will survive
so, in the case of unbalanced system, i a is equal to say current here, this current is your what you call this current, this is i a current, so this current is i a right
now, we have to see what isthe drop in this particular segment that is between a and b
so, we assume that yes there is a fixed transaction cost when you convert the cash into marketable securities and marketable security into cash
so, guys i hope that you understand what we have studied today
put all these things and add them together
in such a case, if these two are large your mobilities are also large and hence the conductivities is also higher
so, you can just substitute that in an expression, 1020 by 50 by 100 which is 2,040 milliseconds
so for a given floor plan there can be more than one slicing trees possible
so, the advantage of using this is it will require lesser space compared to single op amps right
so in my circuits if i have a scenario where there is a, lets say, and gate which is driving a and b, i can directly take the and of these two without any corrective steps, simply bit by bit, and it becomes zero, one, zero, zero
this kind of next to each other if we are showing at the same level at the same level such kind of things what we call chain dimensioning
now this total input power is equal to 0 for a lostless medium so if this is 0 then implies that this is also equal to 0, in other words we have the summation of an square is equal to the summation of bn square
adjustment disorder i think we have called it as illness, but it all depends on the dimension thing how much you suffer in face of a live event, how much you can now here something beyond secondary comes in
i declare it as instead of telling it as digitalin, i mention it as interruptin, and the name of this object i have given as “wheel”, and for pwm out i am calling it “motor”
so, that the numerically approximation is more or less correct right and once i have got this then my favorite expression is for your rcs what was it equal to limit r tending to infinity 2 pi r e z scattered e z incident
so the torque is going to be very high if i do not include any external resistance
then we have to transport again in transportation fuel is used the truck itself is used so the truck the manufacturing with the truck also correctly should be taken into account and then we had emissions, so this is the aggregate
so, it should be b j and if a i and b j work then you go to a i plus 1 b j plus 1 and so on and whenever we find two letters which differ then the commons adverse starting at a j has ended and you so from i j i have a common subword of something
when i am talking about the data processing instructions we are talking about carrying out various arithmetic and logic operations on data
suppose you have this figure you have n number of capacitors and across each capacitor is voltage is v 1 v 2 v 3 up to v n in between some k th capacitor that is also there right
similarly, this is another important equation whatever is the condition at which we are talking about the slip
so, you will have cell line storage
and this covered all the repulsive and attractive forces
using that strategy what we are going to construct is o to p6 we will measure the distance
so, v cos alpha is equal to put small v and i cos beta you put vi right and because your i i i cos beta you put i because, we have taken the vertical and horizontal projection that phasor diagram everything is written
so, i call this as the cross magnetizing effect, so the armature reaction essentially create 3 effects on the overall flux profile at some point it is creating a magnetizing effect, so i should have actually seen an increase in the flux, but already i am operating close to saturation
i would like to refer to a very interesting article by karen stollznow
it will amount to one and the same thing, but the fact is you know x n you know x n
in the same way g k chesterton, has also expressed similar reservations when the presence of too much smile on a human face makes it rather kindly at first glance, but at the second glance this same presence of continuity smile makes a person look rather cowardly
so, this formula is something we used before to calculate the width of the depletion region
so, we will do this again later on in the course if i take these first two equations and i solve them together outcomes the equation of a plane wave or a wave
so again for gate array, your placement should be good enough so that your routing can be completed
so because it is algebraic manipulation it is ah little difficult implement
06 upon 447, so 179
so this is essentially the way we are going to analyze the effect of an electric current when we consider a magnetic circuit
so, suppose, we wish to have this latch in the center of the shaft, to have this we have the mate advanced mate called width
in other words like before we can write m itself as a times d and n as b times d for some numbers a and b, because m is is multiple of d and so is n
so, one way to think about this is higher the temperature faster the electrons and holes are moving, because they have higher thermal velocities
so, particularly this function and this, the laplace transform, in case of frequency shift and frequency differentiation will be used most frequently when we will do the inverse laplace transform
bbecause it is within that band of 159
so, now let's try to understand why the ac is important in our circuit analysis and why we want to study
while if you see the second part, it has the sinusoidal part which has a frequency of twice the frequency of voltage or current
so this is all about the todays lecture about the steel as a structural material
so, regardless of; so, what should this for when alpha is equal to 1 what kind of a curve i will expect here, straight line, curved line, angle, vertical to x axis, y axis, 45 degrees what kind of curve do i expect; straight flat line right answer is equal to 1 right
it is converting it to it into something which i am not comfortable with or it could be that implicit conversion finds that given an object or given an expression there are multiple possible conversions and it becomes ambiguous to which one should be taken
room temperature silicon in air creates a ‘native oxide’
now, immediately if we are projecting these lines, in this direction similarly in this direction if we are projecting the other views will can be constructed
the interviewer of course, maintains their role and social distance from the interviewee and then you go ahead with this very interview
so, in general and electromagnetic problems are very challenging because of these induced currents floating around everywhere and this is one rigorous way of dealing with it when the geometry is very general need not be some very specific thing ok
so, it was a disadvantage of abc ok
so, volt for two winding transformer that your v 1 minus v 2 into i 1 is equal to i 2 minus i 1 into v 2, as if if you if you if you go like this as if this is one winding, this is your one winding
so, this say this the interrupt service routines the internal external interrupt service routines can be interrupt sources can be integrated with the system and we can have the service routines for them for getting various jobs done ok
nothing is flowing through this and and this is open means, i 3 is equal to i 1
so, how i am made it from this diagram only i will not go for left and right right that this portion of course, will come to this portion right, but it from here only we will try to make it look at that
so, we have not defined it in the code
the most important are the standard techniques, either internal standard or external standard
so, i simply apply that this identity and my signal flow graph now simplifies
but it definitely not a good option to feed the induction motor with unnecessary harmonics that is not a good option at all
and, i would suggest that whenever you are using some standard library component, please look up the manual to see what all other functions that component has
so, for the same object the 2
it could be at the lintel level, it could be at the, it's provided at the plinth level, the lintel level, the roof level and if you have a floor above you also provide it at the sill level
there are three heuristics which are proposed
that is we cannot have there is a single tem wave that can propagate through a medium
first of all we have to eliminate the need for multiple dc bias sources we have to make sure that our circuit works with a single battery
when you pull the seed crystal there is formation of this silver crystal and then you will see a boule which looks similar to this one or it looks similar to this one you see, right
so, if f comma g is equal to 0, then f g are orthogonal
there can be another parallel wire running like this, there can be another parallel wire running like this
so, to go more in deep, another ratio is calculated that ratio is known as quick ratio or sometimes it is called as acid test ratio
there are 16 external channels that are connected to the input/output pins and out of the 16 channels, 6 of them are available on the arduino connector pins
so what i started with here
so, this is how you can see the change in the amplitude,
now in this expression if you set gm to zero, the answer is rg plus rs
so, these are the answer phi 1 phi 2 phi 3, this one the answer you please all the reluctants everything computed
we had the opening stock of the 40 kages opening stock at rupees 3 per kage
no changes are permitted and long term plans are made based on this documented requirement the design is made on based on these documented requirement even test cases are written based on this documented requirement and therefore any change to this requirement will require changes to all documents and therefore those who use a waterfall model they heavily discourage the customer to make even the small changes but let's look at the observation of frederick brooks, who is one of the gurus in this area
if we are looking at that in the 3rd angle projection systems, the same cylindrical object in the 3rd quadrant we are placing
so this will be a simpler circuit so you have to just apply kirchhoff's voltage law and find out the value of voltage v1 which comes outs to be 2 volt in this case
i’ll be like yes, i have but i am not able to recollect, i am not able to remember where i kept those notes
ok, and we will see later that where we talk about the compaction of the responses
very easy to understand band pass filter once you know how the low pass and high pass filter works
because profit to any manufacturing organization is not only from the production and sales, it is from the non operating activities also
this memoized recursion tells us that we will store values into a table as and when they are computed
so, how does patent law decide or how does patent law determine that there is a difference between normal talent and that of a genius they nearly look at the fact whether a skilled person who is an ordinary person in that field could have come up with the invention
so you will not have a dropping characteristic at all, you will in fact have in a synchronous machine a steady characteristic like this, i mean it cannot come down it should be a straight line, horizontal straight line
same way a queue may be also a list, but we only want the add and remove queue at opposite ends and we do not want to confuse this with the list operations; we do not want things like append and extend to be used indiscriminately
but all edges of the clock need not result in a change in the signal state
so, here also if like i make say a small a dot in reading the pointer position see i make an error of due to say parallel x error, i make an error of say may be 1 degree
since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy right
if you find that we have reached an empty node then we do the equivalent of creating a new node here we set this value to be v and we create a new frontier below by adding two empty nodes in the left and right rather than just having none
so, within that now you have your audience in front of you there itself you can do so many other things
so you must very carefully choose your lens if you are choosing a p i r sensor for heat detection, for detection of humans and um, for example
can you do both
if i can remove v 1 the small price i have to pay is the surface fields on this
this computer can represent my behavioral few
so, actually whenever positive and negative charges are separated energy actually is expanded
so, what we discussed
so, you can imagine situation
so, in this case qt is equal to 0
so here, you have 3 variables if you use branch current method
so, first select this circular portion, then go to this line, click this one; then there is option like thin feature, change this 1 mm to 0
this is exactly like a schmitt trigger right
so, now if i have a problem, which you can see here
now i assume that the network fails, right
these methods for tracking 2d human form or motion open up new ways for people and machines to interact
so we find that i test equals rg plus r s plus gm, we test r s by rg plus r s
if i want a parameter to be input, i make a call by value; if i want the parameter to be output as well, then i will do a call by reference because then the changes done in that formal parameter within the function will also be available in the actual parameters; because the actual parameter and the formal corresponding formal parameter enjoys the same address
9fuatn by gamma m1 so if i put the value of avg as 1440 into 250 by root 3 gamma m0 is 1
in our next video in our next class we will see some nice demonstration of this fact and then we will talk about the energy meter where these two phenomena’s are used ok
so, calculate j then a then h and e that is the general philosophy that we follow right
this guy is fully known because all that i need to know to specify this other node location, which are known because i broke up the domain into known node locations
see, what is what we have input signals he completes half cycle here, then quarter cycle here, then another quarter cycle and then half cycle here
so, we i will explain when 1 is needed and when one when the other is needed ok
so preparation of that table with regard to standard cost and actual cost and calculating lcb i will be doing in the next class
again, it's easy if you think of v10 being changed to v10 plus delta v2, v2 being changed to v2 plus delta v2 and so on
a very important aspect which is essentially related with the way we interpret body language of others is that it is always interpreted in clusters
please understand that if is going to be somewhat proportional to the flux, so if this is proportional to the flux, the torque is proportional to phi multiplied by ia this is what we said, so i can say indirectly this is approximately equal to some constant multiplied by if multiplied by ia
second case would be the case when network has dependent sources
) now, let us look at some very simple aspects, so, let us say what would happen if we print this particular line, so, printf percentage x, buffer 2
so, basically we looked at all these method of starting common to both the motors except for the last method where i am going to tamper with the rotor resistance alone
so is the case with memory and therefore the time taken no in the next phase is no different from the time taken originally to memorize the information, okay
so, this is my u i; i is equal to
how does this quantity come about and what does it mean
so this is a multi step process then solve that problem and modify that in your prototype
1st order
so, it is 10 angle 30 degree into 5 angle your 15 degree because current conjugate so that is actually 50 angle 45 degree right
it is a simple smile and because the two lip corners go upwards symmetrically, it means that it is a genuine happiness
so, i am connecting it to d3 for controlling the motor rotation, and d4 for sensing the optical interruption from the opto coupler
we can borrow from the scratch terminology here and talk of designing for low floor high ceiling and wide walls
that forces the zinc to corrode and protect the steel reinforcement
so, you can go and read this interview, he talks about i mean a little bit of history of maxwell’s equations and where he thinks it is going in so on and so on, do read this thing alright
one of the reasons, this silicon has now come to dominate the micro electronics industry is because we can actually control the conductivity and the electronic properties of silicon by doping
so, we can use our flip flop like this before; before this input i mean; so this input will be passed through this flip flop and then we can use it ok
i will come to the, of course here we are looking at the equivalent stress block which is the same as in a reinforced concrete or a reinforced masonry stress block that we looked at where the axial force, axial force resultant, the axial force is equilibrated by the stress block of with a into t into 0
in overriding, whenever you talk of overriding it means that you are trying to attach two different definitions to a function by the same name and necessarily the same signature
so this means that if you plot this characteristic there will be a part in the second quadrant which means that the device is not passive
we are keeping setting it aside
we have now created the roadmap, we have set the goals and targets, we won't to walk on that because once the road is decided, the path is decided, then a map is decided, it's very easy to walk on that
now apply continuity equation
so, the choice of this 0
so, in next lecture we will try to find out, how you will utilize this knowledge in analyzing the circuit
what i am applying is v1 what i am getting here is e1; i can also call that as e2 dash no harm in saying that, right
now why i am saying is that in this grid representation, the size of each grid, this size of the each grid, should be large enough so that it can contain the line that is running through it and also the separation
so, this is that value of the input power for which the value of the gain will be 1 db lesser than what it should have been
so, v c 0 plus is nothing but the v c 0 minus, because at the time of switching the voltage cannot be change instantaneously across the capacitor right
of course, we do not have a format here; it is a constant string being printed
so, what is for example, let us look at part by part, what is the inverse fourier transform of this beta tilde
so we take profit or loss for the period and divided by number of shares
so, 16 is here 16 i 3 minus i 4 because it is we have moving like this, this 16 i 3 minus i 4 because we are moving clock wise we are moving in the super mesh right we are moving like this like this right
now, release your mouse button
the constructor needs to be called by value and so on so forth
swap may be one specific instance
under gravity they are basically distributing the load, the loads or the forces coming from the floor to the peers and have to be provided with lintels so that if it is unreinforced they don't crack
so, once we plug in the numbers, i am just going to write the final answers, but you can just go through and check
let us see next one which is our flicker noise and then we will see burst noise
as far as properties are concerned when you have hardened the compressive strength matters, the strength of motor matters, the tensile strength of motor matters
the underline pedagogical design principle here is that a formative assessment that is we design learning activities that is specifically intended to generate feedback on performance to improve enhance and accelerate learning
so, i have just equated n and p
segment i mean
and as i have seen with a large number of my students, in students mind the thinking always is that i is an integer possibly its value was 2; j is another integer possibly its value was 3
there is a switch statement, which actually checks the value of variable “state”, it can be either 1, 2, or 3
first of all i would like to thank you for spending your time on listening to these lectures
so, this is under fixed assets, under non current assets
that is the clock width constraint
so, notice that all the terms on the left hand side and the right hand side have one factor in common which is e n i there all exponential so there will be multiplied with each other
so r and q combined will correspond to the total are of the chip
standard namespace, so we have been talking about this that, all c++ puts all its standard library symbols, classes, functions, everything in the std namespace
so, how many yee cells have i drawn 1 or 4
it means that, you always start with an index 0 and take as many elements as specified in the second parameter
so, what we will do is we will get i plus n k for the largest n such that i plus n k is smaller than j, but if i go one more step, if i go to i plus n plus 1 times k then i will cross j right
what is true about sigma one, sigma to two, q one and q two
so, we have made two pins as rx and tx for arduino, which is pin 10 and pin 11
immediately after you do the schematic you have this, you should have this and then of course edit 0 1
it should come back
so, for the moment i stop here and the remaining schedules we will prepare in the next class
in that case if you see the response for current it would be exponentially decaying because of the exponential factor of e to power minus factor which you have
now what we need to find out
now, consider the magnetic field of a dc motor you know there is no current in the armature conductors the lines of flux path is shown in figure 10
so, from 12% to 17% see npat is bound to be less because this is before tax
and we saw that it was very interesting to that, it was a very nice correlation basically
so, one example of a coupler, a very simple waveguide based coupler is suppose, suppose we have a waveguide with the partition in between and suppose this is our input port, let us number this, isolated port is usually represented by the symbol 2, coupled port is represented by the symbol 3 and throughput by the symbol 4
so, that this is the fermi energy of an intrinsic semiconductor
this is sim900a gps, gprs modem
so, it will be v upon z1 plus v upon z2 plus v upon z3 right therefore, i is equal to y1 plus y2 plus y3 v
so, if i do connect it in series with rl like this, i will have id0 times rl and rl is 100 kiloms
and of course, i is always going to be less than or equal to j, because we are doing it from left to right, so we can assume that the segment is given to us with two end points where i is less than or equal to j
so when we create metal or glass crystals, what you do
now, the way we do the current division same way the phi 2 actually phi 2 1 right, phi 2 is equal to this one it is phi 2 1 is equal to you can write the phi 1, this is the total flux into r 3 divided by r 3 plus r 2 the current division diode and here also flux division
now, if i look at it from the top, as i said earlier, this is how m looks all over the place and best way to find divergence is using its definition, which says that divergence of m integrated over a volume is going to be equal to the surface integral over the surface of this volume
i am doing a down cast and i have done that cast in terms of the way c allows me to do the cast which is the forced cast
so going this way, i'll get one value which is exactly opposite of something
number of flip flops is about two thousand two k, then your overhead will come to about six point seven percent
so to understand this, let us again take this conductor, which is supposed to be solid and e zero inside
if the objective of the university is only to create new knowledge through research and to disseminated, not for profit
this arises simply from stokes theorem as follows: if i look at this boundary and make a very small loop here, the e field on this, the side like this, on the side like this, then e dot d l is going to be equal to integration
so, this is closed this is closed and and this this is your node a, this v means your v infinity right the steady state value at that time this this one it is short circuited right
so, the scenario is a class may have one or more constructors as many as it wants through different mechanisms of overloading, but it must have only one way to destruct and there is a profound reason that the things are defined this way because obviously, once when you are about to construct an object, you certainly have choice, you would like choice in terms of what kind of object what initial values for parameters and all that, you want to set and based on that it is quiet logical that you may need different mechanisms or different parameters sets to construct the object and therefore, you need a number of overloaded constructors
so, for the top one, we always have to intersect generator generator line and the equal division made on one of the generator
and all of them are correct of course, they are merely rearrangements of the same expression
the very fact is the society it is still 10 percent by social political condition 20 percent should do it, but they are not that means, because they are not having an illness, because
so if i am going to have ef leading, i can say the power is flowing from ef towards this side, this is the direction of power flow right
this dotted line that i have drawn over here is the outermost boundary which actually it does not really exist, so i am i mean it is far away, so let us just call it s infinity
now, it is given n 1 is equal 300 rpm, n 2 is equal to 375 rpm and i a 1 is equal to 15 ampere this is given from which, from these 2 equations from these 2 equations, you can find out i a 2 will be 18
how do you do that
to look at the second type of equality that list3 and list2 are actually the same physical list in the memory
that is the group which as to be assessed and treated right, now
so, there are exactly like those secondary sources; because what is the location
so, this is also very important point because whenever you want to present phaser in present sinusoid in phaser terms, it has to be first converted into cosine form
this is the energy consumption again you see that there is a trend similar to what we saw in cement the energy required for an opc m30 concrete goes down slightly when we have lc3 again because we have reduced the clinker and even more when we have ppc because lc3 require some energy for calcination of the clay which is not required for ppc
right hand side will give me 1
whereas in rheostatic breaking i am dissipating that energy in the form of heat, so i am not utilizing it
now, said that if we do a reference parameter, that is if we use call by reference, then the parameter actually is input and output parameter
once we have that x, y, z information; it will construct at the background a parametric variation p of u, v; any point on that surface can be interpolated using information of first point p 0, second point p 1 and third point p 2
another entry is the machine details, which processor was this particular file compiled for, it could have entries like i386, x86 64, arm, mips, and so on
we all know that we want transistor in our amplifier to be highly efficient
if you are saying that you will be using a rom to store your input vector, to store your output response, you need ah rom of a very large capacity, large size, because for a modern this circuits circuits let say you made a requiring millions of test vectors and and in the circuit there can be hundreds of outputs
however, it shows interest friendliness and curiosity because it is relatively mild
if we do not balance it then the danger is that if we keep inserting and sorted sequence then we keep inserting larger values it keeps adding on the right child
theorist were working in the area of nlp suggest that the natural eye movements that accompany thought processes are never random
now we will go one by one
human centered design is an alternate name for design thinking
now, i had mentioned this when i wrote my first book in 2007
you must be knowing that today we have the power companies
this is important because, trap states can usefully trap the carriers and these have a longer lifetime then the electrons and holes in the band
there is a shrinkage of the order of six hundred in this case six hundred to seven hundred micro strain
so, there is a trade off on what material you choose in order to get the maximum value of the power
the maximum we can do is to use a material which is of very very low resistivity
i mean if it happens that from the tower and their line insulators also connected, there will be flash over between the tower and the insulator to one or more of the phase conductors
if you remember that was our operator equation on which we have studied the method of moments right
1350 mu h, which refers to the mobility of the holes in the valence band slightly smaller
then, also can you see this green line, if i extend it will not intersect with this black line
what articulation means is that learners need to express their ideas, explain their actions, their reasoning give reasons for why they arrived at certain decisions and so on
98735 minus j 0
in this show we find that the protagonist doctor cal lightman who has been modeled on paul ekman, the famous psychologist and his colleagues in what is known as the lightman group take up assignments from different parties and most of these parties are the local in the federal law enforcement agencies and they assist in investigations and normally they are able to reach at successful conclusions and find out the reasons behind different crimes
so, technically meep is implementing this turn on function using tan hyperbolic function and as i mentioned there is a open source we can go and look at the code and see all that information
the analog out you can connect to one of the analog input pins and 5 volts and ground
if p x is the average, which the median
rilem is a place where researchers meet, it is sort of an association that researchers in construction materials and structures and systems meet, work together to bring about new reports, bring about recommendations that could lead to standards
and so, let us consider of a situation and so, i particularly request you to listen to this particular topic very carefully because this is one topic which i myself had confusion or doubt for many years ok
the destructor will go through
to draw parallel, perpendicular, and inclined lines, we use these drafter along with set squares
instead of writing total capital, we will say a's capital, b's capital, c's capital
so, what i am getting in the x plate is not really h and not even im in amperes, it is rather im multiplied by whatever is the series resistance i have got
one is pogics 1 which deals with system interface, that is what are the system routines and what are their parameters and the semantics what it does
in the next module, we will see how using these resonators we can actually build the narrowband filters
so this is the 1st equation using kvl
sometimes it is meeting, sometimes it is not meeting changes in parameter values of transistors resistances over time
so, you will get basically after simplification all this things you will get v 3 is equal to 0
right, but what i have achieved is that earlier there are two nodes that were high activity, but now there is a single node which is high activity, right
so, that is the idea rather than then moving like this, if we represent circuit, if we represent the source voltage source or current source right, by we multiplied by unit your step function, how when we will solve the circuit at that time we will know how it behaves, right
now you may want to switch on the ah camera to actually catch the face of the person who, on which you want to start either recording or use it for the purposes of authentication, in case it is a door access system
if i apply c equal to zero, the second term vanishes and the c bar becomes one
we are in module number 4 lecture number 35 on orthographic projections
integrating over v 2 right
so, v phase by c ideally, i am just stimulating vacuum only; so, ideally this ratio should be 1 right so, this is 1, and here what i will plot is delta x to make it sort of normalized to wave length because as a frequency changes, everything delta x will have to change i will just do this the wave length that this electromagnetic wave is going
now, the conversion part is something which is often neglected in an ip policy there could be instances where the routine manner in which patents are filed by filing a provisional because provisionals are normally filed in a hurry there is some urgency to be met and you file a provisional, but then following it up with a complete is something that would be done within say 12 months time
we have seen earlier that ni depends upon the band gap ncnvexp eg2kt
equal stands for engineering change order
so what we see is that this is our hardware trojan, we have the trigger over here and this e value is what gets leaked to the output of the multiplexer
now, one thing that you will notice is in these equations what is the variable of integration
so you are going to have a very large value as synchronous reactance which tells me when i calculate regulation eventually the drop could be pretty large
you are not having cancer, but we still feel bad
so, how an aerodynamic damping can be used
now, the difference can be 1 volt 2 volt 4 volt anything, but the output will be same as 12 volt constant, it is not going to change ok, but on this side left side v p is less than v n
now, how much is the flux linkage of this coil at any particular time
now this is just an example
so, add to this, you look at the effect of the equilibrium for the gravity forces
but, the slip at which the maximum torque occurs that has r2 in the numerator, which means as i increase r2, if i increase r2 like in the case of a slip ring induction motor, where i can include resistances from externally okay
we know v equals to i, r and we know v by r equals to i, which is equals to d q by d t
we are not immediately going into depths of static polymorphism
well what is important about these constants are let me just write it over here you said this as a j into something ok
so, let us take a little different and bigger example
after that we will go construct a metric 10 thread
if it sends either from this number or from this number, then it should work
so, p 0 to 7 goes to this latching of latching of this lower order address bus here and the data bus is connected to d0 to d7
we are looking at the rate monotonic scheduler and we had looked at some issues, the schedulability analysis and also we looked at the transient overload handling and so on
this one we consider as 1 winding and this one, we consider another winding right
a much more useful problem in practice than the longest common subword is what is called the longest common subsequence
this is the more complex sub problem among the three, say, horizontal and vertical channel
a non preemptible resource is one where once a task is using the resource, we cannot preempt it any time that we need to another task to run, need to wait until the task completes use of the resource
so, if this is the case if this is the case, let us let us actually implement the circuit implement the circuit on the breadboard on the breadboard and let us see what happens what happens to our output voltage when we apply 5 volts peak to peak sine wave
so, that is a very common requirement yeah
but in case of line search algorithm, the concept is somewhat different
say 4000 your, a 4500 upon 225 voltage in a step down transformer 50 hertz, 50 hertz means the frequency, right f is equal to 50 hertz
although most of the flux will go like this may be, one or two of flux lines will go like this and go like this
we all know that c has a possible use of a boolean type, which is a type where we say that it can take a value, either true or false
it can be a chip, it can be a circuit which consists of several chips
the current cannot change instantaneously so the value of current i naught will be 5 ampere
so the interconnect delays we have already talked about the r c delays and other things
we discussed different type of the variances, material variance, labor variance and overhead variances, and all those variances were linked to the direct cost or the variable cost
i means again, let us argue that i am applying one thousand test patterns to a circuit
so, the market control as envisaged in a us model or anglo us model is not very active
this is inevitable if i use this
now, what happens if there is some other object in the vicinity of this antenna, that object will also have some current induced, i mean the field will fall on it, induce some current that induced current in turn will radiate another field, that field will come and fall on this antenna
so, therefore, vn can be found out using potential divider rule again this is v o this is 0
now you could go three levels, four levels and get more out of this case
and if i do this, the car will get started, sample composition based model
so, if you want, we can have more turns ok
so, this is 1100 favorable
but then somebody can think of a purely incremental model where there are no iteration in which the system is just developed in small increments and given to the customer but the customer feedback is not really taken to change the existing functionality there is no iteration in a incremental model, the software is developed in increments and delivered to the customer
that is, there will be no component of magnetic field along the direction of propagation but the electric field along the direction of propagation will have to be nonzero
so, all the expenses for any company are to be put under six heads
now following the steps we will go through this example and we will be able to understand how to design a splice ok
so, this is the order; however, trap has lower priority than the hold signal used for dma so will come that, so there are if you remember there are 2 pins hold and hold acknowledge available in 8085 so they are used for a particular type of data transfer which is known as direct memory access or dma
and then here voltage is your ah v 1 and raise 2
it is actually different relaxation times t 1 t 2
compaction is a mechanism which drastically reduces the number of bits, like we mentioned, ten to the power, nine to thirty two or sixty four
for example, up till very recently in japan listeners are taught to focus on the neck of the speaker and avoid a direct eye contact because they wanted to pay respect to the speaker
so in case of h parameters we were having v2 is equal to 0 that is output port was short circuited
obviously if there is less time involved in preparation, then it means that the number of notes that need to be shared should be less
so, memory is an important factor that is to be decided when you develop and embedded system, number of ports and their types
and the task at hand, the best examples of mnemonics is, rhymes and jingles
so, force is now connected to x1
because as soon as otherwise as soon as we switch on back emf will not be there and you if you make it at a very small you are what you call where is i mean it is at a minimum value
there if you to see your what you call the design of this synchronous generator i mean, when the repair is or something you will find it look so beautiful that you are what you call that is a in first synchronous generator in the power plant right
16 times 10 to the 5 meters per second
so, they like a visual aid
say we have 2 networks in series, i am calling these 2 networks to be in series because they have the same currents flowing through them, so this is network 1 and this is network 2
but when this wall deforms, the bed joints are now going to be subjected to a state of shear
in terms of the circuit connections, there will be a connection to power supply
so, 49 gives the total response of the r c circuit to a sudden application of dc voltage source, that is r c circuit we apply assuming the capacitor is initially charged right
so, by examining the value of whatever is returned we can check whether the update we intended worked or not
here we have considered the amplifier is your non inverting amplifier
so; that means, the your reaction field is f2 we have drawn right in the diagram of the rotor is always stationery with respect to the stator field f1 or the resultant field fr right so all these things are remain stationary
is there some does are you reminded of some way of evaluating this limit as r tends to 0
so the core and the coil are separated only by the insulation
so, we can see this is fixed in the center and it is in the middle of this plane and this particular plane
so, i have say one coil, which is like this and see i have another coil which is here and let me have another coil, which is like this ok
so what i am saying is that this problem can i modulate equivalently as three bodies b one, b two and b three which are connected by three springs whose spring constants are k equal to five, k equal to two and k equal to three
now 20 30 and 60 you here what you call they are in series; that means, 1 upon ceq say is equal to 1 upon 20 plus 1 upon 30 plus your 1 upon 60; that means, ceq is equal to 1 upon 20 hope it is readable for you i am drawing on the circuit, 1 upon 60 to the power minus 1 just reciprocal of that that is why minus 1 is given right
so, what is expected here is also a double value but what i have provided, i have provided an integer value
so, all of them are ultimately added together clearly because i assume that all of them are connected in series, ultimately
this after cut whatever this center one projected on to that
there are other ways also iõll show one of them
so, this is just some facts which we should all know
so, i am not doing it here, but please do it
let’s take the quantities, if i say that at 100 percent load i am going to have i1 square r1 to be 100 watts let’s say
the most significant of that is from the c++ program, if you have used bool to specify your boolean value, anyone else who reads the program will be able to understand that this variable cannot take any other value, other than true or false
so, if this e goes to element 1 3 or 4 what will happened
notes might be an activity that he might do in this particular
just for comparison, if you look at the value of kt, which is a thermal energy at room temperature, kt has a value of 25 milli electron volts
you will say 1 ohm is nothing but 1 volt per ampere
some part will still get reflected right if you look at your reflection coefficient fresnel reflection coefficients there is going to be some as long as there is a difference between n 1 and n 2 between two mediums refractive index some reflection happens, but that reflection i can control by controlling the refractive index of this green region right
looking in there, we wanted that to be infinite
they had to join hands, but they were both these three companies were sure about that one day, geo will have to start pricing their services
and if you for example you your your miss a waste your time in analyzing the other direct overheads, other direct overheads are for example say how much you can say it is 2% of the total cost of the product
so, this 48 and 16 will be parallel equivalent is becoming 12 ohm right so; that means, the circuit is coming like this is your 12 ohm and then again 12 ohm is in series with 18 ohm because 18 ohm resistance is here
if the windings are heavy it will be very difficult to actually make the winding manually or even machine wound windings around preprocessed core
so, that is why this power output power output generating unit 1 and this is power output generating unit 2 and this side is frequency hertz, it is given in hertz, right
for example, if g is equal to 1 upon r, right
so, meter will indicate some value, but this circuit is not disturb
in that case the easiest thing what one can do is join each and every point, perhaps pick these points join it by a line
something, like if i am saying this is the vertex perhaps there might be one edge, another edge is coming, another edge is going; that way a network will be constructed
similarly on the glass box because, this is the front view kind of direction
so, this is the new position of the v s dash right
when that goes to zero, your equilibrium comes merely from the axial force level and the geometry itself
a profit and loss account is a statement showing incomes and expenses
because your learners will be able to relate to it, because they have just learnt it and later on it will only may being more useful to them
if i say, name 1 colon colon v 1 2, it will associate here
so there will be one word for lying a, one word for lying b, and so on
so you get i 2 is equal to minus 2 by 3 i 1
so you can combine both of them and represent by one single block and then the block will be f1s into f2s
tem modes are where both the electric and magnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of propagation
similarly, we saw that we could form p type by doping with group 3 – boron, aluminum, gallium, indium
so, depending on which of these conditions held when this definition was executed, later on the value of f will be different
the unit vector is going to be in r 1 2 direction of magnitude unity, if i write like this then you notice that force on 1 is in the direction opposite of r 1 2
it is to be made sure that all the goals mentioned in the intended learning outcome was embedded in these learning activities in one way on the other
so, the roots of the characteristic equation which we just discuss are refer to as the eigenvalues of the matrix a
and the difference voltage vd is v0 by a0, which can also be written as vi, the input voltage times k by a0 divided by 1 plus k by a0 now, what happens as a not goes to infinity
now, i will be connecting this speaker with d3 and one with gnd which is the fourth pin from this side
there are a few aspects that you need to understand from such a hysteric curve
if t 0 is equal to 0, then it will be v 0 right
so, let us note 100 mm on page
c99 introduced explicit boolean type and that is given by the name underscore bool, where b is written in capital, but that since that is not a very normal natural way to write bool, it has also provided a new standard library header called std bool dot h, where three macros are provided
so, these are the thing have been asked to and you have to do it
and add fixed cost, if you add the fixed cost in this, that will remain the fixed
so, this 2 are added, so that is why your this thing is there right, similarly here right
the next example is provision for tax
and analogous tp the previous case we can do this whole thing using a while instead of doing it with recursive thing
now, you see, from natural optimization point of view, why should we unnecessarily make a gate larger, the channel larger
so, we will assume that it's a two port network
robin boundary condition what did you say yeah our usual abc absorbing first order abc i can apply it over here that works anyway for i know it does not work for evanescent waves, but still it does something
so our estimates of the wire delays can be quite inaccurate
similarly this transposed term will also vanish
so, acm would change; in this case when i substitute the value; this is the new value; 0
a concept of wall density is introduced and this is something we will again speak about when we talk of assessment in the next week
it will go in investing activity, not in the operating activity
you need very very relevant information long term formation and there you don't need only your accounting information
static timing analysis is a software tool using which you can estimate the worst case delays in a combination circuit net list
so this is your circuit, initial circuit
so, the total value is 60,000
so, what are the minus points
so, it is a useful visual aid to keep track of traveling voltage or current wave as it reflects back and forth from the end of the line because it will be you know sending and receiving end in it will be reflected back and forth
it may occur when either a person is engrossed in one’s own thought and wants to cut off from the whole situation or on the other hand wants to in a way block others from the sight and from the cognizes itself
which is the stored energy in the because of the stator winding carrying a current of is the second one will be corresponding to the rotor which looks similar
but we have seen earlier that k is equal to we have seen earlier the k trans ratio is equal to n 1 upon n 2 therefore, r 2 dash will be k square into r 2, right
so, we have two writing modes; ‘w’ for write and ‘a’ for append
now, we understand what a initial value of a radiable with in a certain scope are what is a meaning of having a kind of initial or default for a parameter
so, the force current analogy the mathematical equation of the translation mechanical system are compared with the nodal equations of the electrical system
so, strength and inspiration for excellence in work comes from within
so, you see that if i connect this meter to position 3 then the shunt path or the parallel path parallel to the meter is of a lowered resistance value compare and this or the other path meter path has r m plus r 2 plus r 3
so after that there will be a delay of the flip flop, delay of this flip flop plus delay of the or gate, delay of the or gate plus setup time for the next flip flop before the next clock can come
so, whatever the dimension we would like to really specify that we can do that
so, it has always two foci centres; f and f prime
instead of that it is a common practice to tabulate the things
either it is stmf401re or another device
now, she is back into the integration
a shorted termination by definition is just that, it is a short circuit
primarily it is due to the calcination of limestone which is used to manufacture portland cement
so that means, that if i ground by the terminals, i will see some voltage at the output, even when we apply similar currents to the input terminals inverting and non inverting terminals
so, this is based on per unit or percentage expression of the impedances, resistances, reactance’s and so on and so forth
so, here point a projected onto vertical plane, this is the vertical plane
you still take it to be d x x
so, these in this right top view diagram over here these are sort of we can imagine four nearest i mean in one yee cell all the four values are involved in calculating h at a future time instance right
so, the question we would like to ask is has the value of y changed
so here, as you can see, if here you cannot follow this standard cell kind of design principle, left to place this block individually on the silicon floor, so after placing will have to interconnect them in a suitable way
so at every point you are going to have a transient response, you guys have studied rl circuit response
similarly, here also we have seen know this is delta p tie 1 this we have also you have seen know that previous ah previous ah block diagram ah that this one modeling actually
so, that i get this
so, that passive ah your what you call this ah your v r whatever we have taken that passive sign convention right so, this is a source free rl circuit, now if you if you apply in this loop the kvl it will be v r plus vl is equal to 0 you apply kvl
and when the cloud to earth; current path also established, lightning stroke has happened; a charge will be trapped on the line
so that is why we see that in most countries in india typically we will find the cement plant very near a limestone quarry
now if you are asked to find out the phaser value of minus 4 sine 30 t plus 40 degree, first what you have to do, you have to convert it into a standard cosine term
so, the circumstances that the individual experience they are artificially induced there, but the participant is not removed from the natural habitat is not brought to the lab center
i am just substituted everything that i know and i know that finally, i am going to take the limit let us call this i 1, so, i 1 i am going to take the limit epsilon tending to 0
of course in the elastic cycles you do not have energy dissipation and as you start seeing damage in the wall, that is when cracking is occurring and there is energy dissipation
no in fdtd again there are two formulations, total field formulation and scattered field formulation and depending on the formulation, we will apply the boundary condition to only the scattered field or the total field
so, this is how it will go
but here, the, the, there some gain, which is twenty voltage, given the electric problem
so then the simple relationship, simple inverse relationship that exists before doesnõt exist anymore
so, we have 2 2 major points to keep in mind while we determine the initial conditions
whether you have tried or not
ok, and on top, v d d and the n n d, the bottom, the ground line should be running
if you look at current ratio, you will see it was from 1
so we could connect it with a positive incremental gain in general and even a direct connection was okay
so, now this one determine the voltage across the 5 ohm resister for the dots given in the diagram, then reverse the polarity in 1 coil and repeat
so in those cases we can use the h parameter variables which we will discuss in today's session
the third point, to produce isometric projection; one has to worry in the object, so that its principal edges, whatever the edges we call principal edges, for example, if i am choosing a edge, b edge, c edge, these are arbitrarily i am choosing
we have a function which we call stupid which takes essentially takes an argument and return it, so it does nothing
so, this will give you the laplace transform for nth derivative of our function
we will click on this exploded view
i addition, i am showing some pins just for illustration: one here, one here, one here and one here
so, we learned about there are three varieties: one wireframe model, surface models and solid models; so, now, we are going for this surface models
then variances are ought to be there and whether the variances are is controll controllable, non controllable, acceptable, non acceptable that it is a very difficult situation
these are holes involved and perhaps it might be going into cylindrical shape that is a reason we have this dash dot kind of lines
now just dividing the numerator and denominator by k+ square root of k square 1, what we will get is this
similarly if we consider capacitance, then for omega is equal to 0, it will be infinite impedance reactance and for omega is equal to infinity, reactance will be 0
the wavelength of the light is given, so lambda is 450 nm and intensity per unit area is 1 milli watt per centimeter square
boda phone and idea have entered into a joint venture now that they have started feeling that is very difficult to sustain in the market on the basis of their, say on their own, single individual identity in the market or as a single entity in the market and competing with each other, it will be very difficult because they won't be able to compete with their alliance
so, this switch has been in the position a for a long time and at t equal to 0, it is thrown to position b; that means, in this problem switch was at position a for long time; that means, circuit has reached steady state right circuit has reached
actually, this part of cash flow, that is operating activities part, is very much similar to pnl
and whatever is oq, that represents the final condition
for f equal to f0 okay, the input impedance is z1, hence gamma in is equal to 0that is one simple definition
we are in the realm of inductive definitions, recursive functions and efficient evaluation of these using memorization and dynamic programming
so, 2 0
so i am going to have a moving part which is also probably made up of iron and it is probably going to be connected to a fixed frame somewhere through a spring, this is not an inductance because as an electrical engineer we always think it is an inductance
e b has a value of minus 7
suppose r l is 8 ohm you have taken, now if you change the r l is equal to 10 or r l is equal to say 6 right, every time you are changing r l that means, previous analysis, nodal analysis or mesh analysis or super position whatever we have done; every time you have to solve the whole circuit every time you have solving the whole circuit, right
sales value given to you is 300,000s
so, this is the first qualitative characteristic known as prudence
in the inner surface, if i look at the inner surface, the area vector is pointing invert because area vector is always taken to be going out of the volume
so, this is v m and this is your i m
so let's calculate this flux first
so total energy in volume v was equal to v k square by two, which has now dissipated and gone out through the surface through pointing vector
then we will be looking at expressions for torque, power, etc
along with independence came a big divide, partition of india into india and pakistan
so if plates are subjected to only yield stress then we can find out the cross sectional area as total pu which is pu1 by pu1 plus pu2 by fy where fy is a yield stress of the member
so, when the processor as executed correctly in this case when r0 is equal to r1 then a performance is gained because the speculated instructions could actually be committed at a much more faster rate
c is also proportional to the length
these are common and now design batten plates using weld connections
we do not want to look at the implementation and ask whether it is a list or not, because we do not want the implementation to determine what is allowed, we only want the actual operations that we define as the abstract interface to be permitted
it is possible for a semi conductor to conduct electron but, we have to give some energy
second technique we have to look at continuous changes is what is called chemical shrinkage and this measures the volume changes
so, the no load current has two components, one is core loss component of current, which is in phase with the voltage, the other one is the magnetising current, which is at 90 degree
and n is that speed of the your what you call that your rotating field
so in terms of writing people actually improvise more while writing than on typing or using a fixed information
it should have been somewhat like this, it should have started from the origin, obviously
well, you cannot put p into q because p is already occupied
so you have seen the techniques used for electrostatics when we had a polarizable material in a electrostatic field
27,600 kg is right
ultimate ultimately, if you make this one and integrate, you will get the same result
and as it entered the marth's surface, the vehicle, which is the sojourner river, it was surrounded by airbags, slowly it dropped down onto the mars surface
ok, so the two problems are the same in case of standard cell design
now at the location evp that is a frame pointer minus 12 bytes is where the canary location is present
what are we using
because this company is a big company in birla group, they must be having lot of subsidiaries and have held shares in that subsidiaries
for example: either by showing movies or animation or by asking students to reason and make predictions in what if scenarios
so, did i leave out anything
so what you can say, equivalent capacitance of n parallel connected capacitor is nothing but the sum of the individual capacitances
now, so i would remind you to some of the pitfalls this is one
right, and this is what dijkstas algorithm does
so you first look at pass transistor
for example, let us use sketch fillet
so, for that purpose what we have to do is
the force on charge small q due to the positive charge, will be along the line from capital q to small q in the direction shown by red
so, when the rotor is blocked we are essentially looking at let me first draw the diagram corresponding to this
so, this is the way how you have to distribute your total sales collection part
so i will have to call this configuration have 400 multiplied by root 3 divided by 230 multiplied by root 3 volts, so the primary line voltage becomes 400 times root 3 and the secondary line voltage becomes 230 times root 3
so, this is an example of the life cycle and why we have to think about the different aspects when we are talking about concrete
05 electron volts
nobody else can manufacture the gearbox for maruti or suzuki
so, i can if i use the pseudo inverse i am basically saying give me the minimum 2 norm solutions, where one and the same statement
certainly you will need to write a very complex font in malloc because you really need to say how much memory you want, malloc returns you a void star pointer, you need to remember and cast that to the int star
it shows a defensive as well as a negative attitude with the help of the folded arms; however, the superior attitude is revealed by the thumbs
where you have op amp and if you have the resistors with dc power supply, then you can perform the experiment quickly, right
so that is that part is in the income statement
so, similarly in this case also if you do not have dependent source, you do not have any independent source in the circuit you cannot stabilized the value of current i n
so, we set the queen entry for row i to j and then we mark the corresponding row column and diagonal to be one and when we undo a queen we set the queen entry to be minus 1 and the row column and diagonal entries to be 0; these are all exactly what we wrote in the pseudo code that has been formalized in python code
if there are any shaft seals, how they really look like; based on these hatched lines, based on the material elements, we will represent these complete full sectional details of that machine element
so, this is the reason why we should all study psychology and perhaps i am able to communicate to you that why psychology is essential for you and thank you for taking this course
and inside your cells are growing right and your use your media
you can see here equity dividend is constant
and in order to build a ring oscillator pub, we would use many such ring oscillators and 2 multiplexers, so, in this particular slide we have shown that we have used n ring oscillators, we have 2 multiplexers and a counter and 1 bit response
again, i want to remind you this minus sign, the curl of b equation, whether they are changing with the time, not changing with time, electrostatic, magnetostatic, everything is described by these four equations
because it is forced to draw a sinusoidal magnetizing current, i am going to have non sinusoidal flux and that non sinusoidal flux is going to induce a non sinusoidal emf that non sinusoidal emf and sinusoidal voltage that i am applying cannot really balance each other
a boundary condition
now we know we have studied 2 types of oxidation in thermal oxidation, one is wet oxidation and another one is dry oxidation
so if i write kirkoff's current law equation here let me call this v o, okay
so once he is done with preparing everything what do you guys think he would be doing first after
once these points are noted down draw a smooth curve which pass through these points
the next we see is that the if statement is entered an x is used to index into the array and cause one block of data corresponding to array[x] to be loaded into cache so this data you can assume is loaded into cache and into a register which we denote as i
so, next you come to the capacitor and inductors
now, the function ft may not have a laplace transform at all points
if vdd is fixed, if the supply voltage is fixed, then if you go on increasing rd, this vds will go on reducing, the operating point vds will go on reducing
softcopy at that point
questionnaires very popularly used it can either face to face, it could be done telephonically, it would be sent by post
so, if you substitute we will come later we will see the solution how thing, but this is the equation
i know that if i have a finite set of squares at some point, this process has to stop
so we again go back to the market and if market says yes this is what we asked for, now we are going to actually analyse and we are going to make a proper design or an outline around it and make it a solution to their problem
so, derivative of each term so first term will become 1 by r; second term will i mean the term in the bottom will become minus 2 by
remember, operating point is some point for which you find the solution
and we will mate it up, and we will lock it
because you form cracks
let us call this one x axis, somewhere y axis
and as i told you that there are large numbers of psychometrics tools available, for practical reasons we have limited time and there for restricted ourselves only to 4 popular psychometrics tools
in quantum mechanics psi represents the wave function of the electron
ah just 1 minute here one or two small thing you have ah what you call you have to understand right first you see this x 1; this x 1
so, we can shift this v out maybe here or towards the left maybe if you want so that is also possible ok
so, this is going to circulate a current through the field, initially, i may not even connect the load i will say let the voltage built up then only i will connect the load, until then i will not even connect the load in all probability
so, finally, if you draw this circuit, so i n is equal to 3 ampere, r n is equal to 50 ohm, ,and this and you want to ah, we want to find out the current also through that 50 ohm resistance
so we have to compare or make it comparable
the other way is let us look at this one, giving the height of one side perhaps this one length of taper and slope of the tapered face
the circuit is not complete yet
you can convert arrays to pointer
so, some of you see where this is going
similarly, for energy, we say that if we can experimental data is best so we would take a piece of coal some pet coke or diesel and do bomb calorimetry so bomb calorimetry gives us how much energy is produced from a fuel
if we can make it more efficient this the numbers would go down but it looks like we are already done our best in terms of cement plants most of our cement plants are very efficient and you cannot do much more
4 456 angle 22
so, the direction is fixed
as i had mentioned two modules before that this is our total outline of discussions on casting
so, i have if i change my problem i can relax my requirements on the accuracy of solution
therefore, the voltage across an inductor is 0 thus an inductor acts like a short circuit to dc right
so it means that you can say that current through an inductor cannot change abruptly
yeah, so, dl is this
what about strength
so, i is to denotes the fact these are impurities
l a is equal to 17 meter centimeter that is 0
so, for calculating the labor idle time variance, we will be using the formula abnormal idle time multiplied by the standard rate multiplied by the standard rate litb
the important thing to note is the first component that we have been placed, we have see placed in the window this will remain fixed and it cannot move anywhere
so, with hope hope there will be absolutely no problem for you just just try to basic few things you keep it in your mind rest little bit of assumptions and all this things automatically one after another will come
the vertical wires run in another layer and connect the horizontal wires block connects to the nearest vdd and ground
finally, we are showing the output voltage
so, if you come to the screen what you see is an integrator circuit whose output is proportional to the negative integral of the input signal with respect to time
if you remember, we have discussed provisions when we discuss the balance sheet
i can write we can write i c 1 plus c 2 up to c n dv by dt or i is equal to c q dv by dt ; that means, c eq is equal to c 1 plus c 2 up to c n sum it up; that means, when resistor are in the series we are summing r 1 plus r 2 up to r n say when the capacitors are in parallel at that time their value will be that thing will be summed up right
minor variations of the pinch or the precision grip, help us to underscore the delicacy of the situation as well as the significance of the argument, which we want to pass on
so, these meaningless type of assembly of letters which does not allow you to make a mental representation because they are nonsense, therefore they are called nonsense syllables
there is one port which is called the input port there is another port which is called the coupled port, there is another which is called the through port and one which is called the isolated port
you can take a pause here, solve it and then we are going to check answer for every transaction
so, all the people who crowded around a person what a copy of a bestselling book equally enjoy the intellectual property right, they were able to use it without affecting the right or without affecting the enjoyment quotient of the other person to use it at the same time; which would have been different if people were crammed into a room
here what was the difference how did i do it
first term u 1 u 2, second term u 1 u 2, right hand side is going to give me one more u 1 and some constants right
so, ok let me a so, let us now focus on this circuit ok
it is an individual’s, self reported evaluation of feelings of love or joy or pleasure and contentment and it comes from several positive interactions within environmental stimuli
now in these equations, if you set i 2 is equal to 0 that means you are setting output port as open circuit
these are the cash sales
vc, a voltage across the capacitor is of importance to you because that is the voltage that the load will also be seen and this actually would be the filtered voltage
if we want to do the demodulation, this is the modulation function, if we want to do the demodulation function, then also couplers come in handy
when you have to have low pass active filter, you have to have an amplifier
there are two different notions of equality whether the value is the same or the actual underline object that we are referring to by this name is the same
let us move on and quickly talk on the constructor destructor
this is the unfavorable or adverse
so, m e star for gallium arsenide is 0
the entire lot of ip into 2 categories from business perspective, you have the limited life ip where the duration is limited after which it falls into the public domain and people can use it and you have the unlimited life ip where is subject to renewal it can be kept alive forever
it is not at the
25 and 2, or just above 2
now, at the same time you can transform this signal flow graph into block diagram
so, theoretically this quad nature x is component; it can be made it to 0 right because of i q is equal to i c
so, this is a pass band, and this is the stop band, this is also stop band, this is what it means by this sentence
it is generally 25 kv, what is being transmitted there is 25 kv
it is revolving this way, this is a and this is b again, it will horizontal position at that time voltage generation will be 0
in positive photoresist area not exposed stronger, negative photoresist area not exposed will be weaker
and so, the next thing i could do is pick each one of those frequencies and re run the simulation with the narrow band at those frequencies that will excide only that mode and not the others right
obviously, the phase velocities omega by k which is c in vacuum; now, i want to answer the same question, but now on a in a discrete world where i have discretized phase and time
we just assume that the device is described with currents as functions of voltages and derived the constraints on the incremental parameters
so, the copyright term of a work extended throughout the life of the author and for an additional 50 years
in the 1st part, we will be covering what is noise, how to characterise noise and inthe 2nd part, we will be discussing about noise circle and how to achieve a particular noise figure
instead of saying m percent n as we said before m percent n not equal to 0
so, in that case length is you have considered 1 meter, this is t 1, thickness is t 1, this is the diameter of the conductor dc same here, same it is here dc, and with ice it is as we have seen before dc plus 2 t 1 right, and this is wind force or conductor covered with ice right
so, you can imagine in this case and i am sending some incident wave over here if this i have this blob over here, if this blob were not there what would happen to the wave from here
so, when t is increasing finally, it will reach to the steady state the 2 right
so, for thevenin equivalent the equivalent circuit for rth that is thevenin resistance would be you will short circuit all the voltage sources because they are you have 3 independent voltage sources
so, in these cases you will see that the courses are more than 1 and number of wires are also more than 2 to connect to the load
now, we argued before or we mentioned before that a balanced tree will have height log n
so, in this case, your this is v infinity is equal to 10 volts
we do not consider the paths like
now, formats of observation method are what is called as naturalistic observation
in test 2, has one dictionary entry with dhawan as a key and 27 is the score
the way we have done it that you you you are what you call both current are entering into that dot the magnetic circuit whatever you have studied, right
first question you would ask is why did the copper was there in the first place
the sms alert will be sent to your mobile, and again with a delay we are providing
all others are all other assets, accounts receivables, unexpired insurance, inventory or cash
you have actually returned a local variable
when you make the comparison between these two, so the result is going to be variances, right
now join t and p points
you can see the circuit which is shown here, circuit which is shown here right and the signal that we are applying is to the low pass and high pass filter you can see here correct
at the capacitors of the active high pass filter, this capacitor is connected to the resistors connected to the inverting terminal
so this is a sudden change in the slope during this point
so, this is one this rule will not tell to anywhere right this is just to if you want keep it your mind, then you will find things are very simple right
so, in this particular mechanism, because of the rocking behavior, deformation capacities or the ductility that is available in the system is significant
so, we had a substantial turnover in 2003, where new rules were frame
if you apply a pulse in soc the conversion will start and internally there will be 8 clock pulses
now the total complex power decipated by an n port network can be given by this relationship
now, as the switch remains closed for long time, capacitor can be considered to be an open circuit by nodal analysis
so for example you have a foundation standing in under the ground and you have capillary suction of the water from the external environment and test method that reflects that is sorptivity test which is again a standardized method as far as astm in the south african durability index procedures are concerned
so both the approaches either you use the net based or path based they has to go hand in hand with the placement algorithm
let us take a cylindrical object, this one
due to fabrication error, they can even come closure
so, suppose let us say you have this circuit ok, you have this op amp based circuit
now, let us take one example
so when you divide d s by n s and you simplify you can represent h s as sum special plus some residual divided by denominator
so, when i combine these two equations i must combine them keeping the vectors in mind right
so, basic understanding of these 3 functions helps to make sense of the first order circuit right
you can just have a look at what is impairment
this is typically how we would like to think of a data structure, we do not want to know what is inside the black box we just want to specify that if we do a sequence of button pushes and we start supplying input through the input box what do we expect to see if the display
so, we have 4, we can take any 2 temperatures, and take the ratio of n i at these 2 temperatures
this a will be three
therefore, and impedance of this branch also also given all this branch given so impedance is z 1, it is z 2, it is z 3 this is given therefore, ah if you if when you write the equation v a is equal to v o ; that means, these voltage these voltage v o minus i 1, z 1 right
so, we will get 400 hertz
so, i can say, i am going to integrate over the surface and what way is the surface normal pointing the surface normal is coming out of the board ok
so, same philosophy will be applied
the assumptions that you have mentioned if you can validate that, whatever you need to validate that, so this is going to be barebones skeleton just to validate your assumptions okay, then the next round you can sort of build, you know give it enough meet to make it a complete system, here we are not there to make a full fledged system and see how it works that is not our aim, our aim is to check with the users this is the first level of testing, you can do multiple rounds of these but the first level is to just go and see what is it that my users want, are they comfortable with this idea
so, how you will say that it is repeating after every time period capital t
so, keep this fixed and keep changing
if you are designing learning materials for an online course you know where it is on a platform like this nptel course
and it did not work
solve as many problems as you can, then go to the laboratory
then what are the applications of op amps, what are the application of operational amplifier, it can be used as an audio amplifier, it can be used as a signal generator, it can be used as a signal filter, it can be used as a biomedical instrumentation and numerous other applications, numerous other applications ok
so, as you are very familiar for concrete you have m20, m30, m 35 and so on where the characteristic compressive strength of concrete is used to designate the strength of concrete, the class of concrete
next is exposes substrate to secondary electron radiation you see that there is a drawback
what is the best way of constructing these data points
now, i am clearing it now current from here from the source from the supply it is i 1, but part of the current that i 0 is going herei 0 is equal to your i c minus j i m
so, what we said earlier was that in a realistic scenario imagine you know an antenna i connect some voltage source to it ok, some rf source, i wanted to broadcast some information
so del square, v equals rho
let us calculate e one and e two by gauss's law
suppose the results are balance sheet p&l etc
that's the basis of the design at the ultimate limit state and this is achieved by the use of partial safety factors
now if you recall, we have already seen in the theory class, what exactly the inverting amplifier is right
so, guys now you know, what are the band reject filters
so, 100*100 will be 10,000 rupees for example, similarly the 1 security for 10 rupees then same way you have to buy 1000 securities from the market
if you remember when we discussed about phase sequence we told that a, b, c sequence will have the angle difference of 120 degree and the p phase will lag a by 120 degree and c will lag b phase by again 120 degree
so, you do not need to worry about that it is been proved mathematically no problem
even in the scattered field formulation i am imposing the boundary condition the rbc which is correctly true only for normal incidence not for non normal incidence right
this gives you gallium, again depending upon the value of x you can have a direct or an indirect band gap material
so, if we are going to add these two distances, it is supposed to give us major axis 70 mm
so, you get a panel with a joint which is not perpendicular or parallel to the edges and that's how this is actually been carried out
now this implies that the assumption that masonry compression controls is wrong and therefore the estimate of k is wrong so we need to go back and look at a situation where the stress in steel is governing and estimate what is the corresponding k and then estimate the compressive stress in masonry
you can use any formula which we have discussed till now
no before i do a time update
since the load is balanced so the magnitude of currents i
so, far before we came to fdtd was we looked at integral equation methods and then we looked at fem methods
now, why do i state that as far as the pm interaction curve is concerned
there is no protrusion from the rotor side
this is the connection diagram which is fairly straightforward
then we look at 3 and look at 7 rather and we find that 7 does appear so we add 7
and now we have a special bonus for you which we’ll show it you in the next video, so stay tuned for the next bonus video
so, in the derive class, what would happen to the visibility of these members and even downwards when i go further below from the derived class what will happen to the visibility of those, so that is defined by this visibility matrix
business and other professional activities are planned within time and diverse understandings about our preferences can also cause confusion
the whole set up moving along the direction of wind and also we can see the motor rotating as per the speed of the wind that will be coming
and this is the explanation for the inheritance related inversion
so pavn is the power available from the network it basically means the maximum power that can be supplied by the network to the load
now we are decreasing the frequency we are decreasing the frequency and you see that when we decrease the frequency, you concentrate on your peak to peak voltage alright decrease it further, decrease it further, decrease, it further and you see now suddenly you can see that the voltage is also started decreasing
similarly, if you think about this centre of the upwards flux, so this is the center of the upwards flux ok, so here this is also the centre of the upward flux
so, first you take an example, say example – 1: a transmission line conductor has been suspended freely from two towers and has taken the form of a catenary that has c is equal to 487
so, what the reinforced masonry section of the code actually talks of is three types of walls
so, let us confirm our intuition, let us calculate the curl of a over here
similarly, construct on the graph sheet all the way down
once, we have that point, we have that curve again we locate a true length on that axis, which makes a horizontal line
so, you have to be careful in terms of deciding arc up to which point level you would like to really go
this is called as a negative variance
i am just discussing matching concept because this is a base for p&m
so, now, this is our ct this is the equivalent circuit of a transformer practical transformer
so, this represents the operating point for the circuit
now, we have incident light that falls on your material, so that generates electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band, because of a reverse bias these electrons in holes are separated and they contribute to the current
similarly here also it will be v by 40 this will be v by 40 right
one is a stator, the other one is a rotor
we will see here, the you can see this particular latch kind of thing is movable to any web there and it is not fixed that of as of now
the current sources is there in both cases with and without object the only difference is the objects presence came to be known due to permittivity term that is the only difference right
1 percent right
easily you can construct a decision tree like this and these are the values
and we can see the signal from what we call the solid part remains more or less constant over time
you see what happens; the bulb will switch on for 2 seconds and will get switched off for 5 seconds, it is switching on 2 seconds switch off for 5 seconds again, it switches on for 2 seconds again switches off for 5 seconds
these are the vertices
so, let us see again from the top, flux lines entering like this ok, motion of the plate is from right sorry i seduced my right hand right hand for getting the emf
so, this can be i of synchronous machine, one let me say this is i of synchronous machine two
so what we do here, in every pass of the simulation we simulate the fault free circuits as well as w minus one of the faulty version
i can think of it like this, and this i know: give me a field e, uniform polarization, gives ne a field minus b, over three epsilon, zero z, plus of field
they are not opposing each other, they are essentially aiding each other
at the same time, the tension which is exhibited through the positioning of the knees etcetera also discloses a lot about the anxiety level a person might be feeling
that is the fixed expenses
we are given the information about the factory cost and we are given the information about the, say the selling and distribution overheads
so, we have a line a b line and this is auxiliary top view
in case of b 410 standard units were required we have used 380
the force on the upper plate is going to be e time sigma per unit area
so, if this condition is true then it does not do anything; if this condition is false then it raises an exception then it will the throw and a certain kind of window out and tell you that this has happened
let us take this small example where we have my global data initialize to 32 and in the program, we increment with the global data by 5 and return that value
so, let us what should we what we can do is, we can write define something called a equivalent current and what is equivalent current
now from these terms which can you think i can ignore anyone term from here given that r lives over here and r prime lives outside
now i would like to represent this zl on the primary side or i want to transfer the impedance from the secondary side to the primary side
in the case of solids the boltzmann function is a good enough approximation of the fermi function
so, we will start with net profit, make adjustments here, add and less, they will give you operating cash flow
these h d l's provide ways to represent both the inputs as well as the outputs of the various steps in the design flow
you will use ohm's law and whatever the current is flowing that is i y and multiplied by the resistance 4 would be the voltage at node a
now see, here you may be little ah that why you are using fault simulation along with test generation
because, in order to implement the global function we had to provide all these get set function
you see, you have this standard cells like this and this space in between which is their
similarly ib will be lagging by 30 degree from ibc and ic will be lagging 30 degree from ica
stoneys equation was developed long time back summer, early nineties, ninetieth century
similarly, by changing this over here to say 64 i will get a string of length 64
first let us look at the component that flows through the bjt
so, now this this is one way
they are kind of rogue cells
it's not a very, it's not a major amount though in terms of percentage it's a 173% increase
so, it is 4 into 1 that is your 4 volt right
so, if the maybe had estimated that for manufacturing the product or one unit of the product say the total cost of the production would be 10 rupees
085 you have seen and input is 18
it has an initial value 15
so, it is this system of walls perpendicular and walls parallel to the direction of lateral action as shear walls and the flow diaphragm plus a system of bond beams
now it is a kind of a colony where every house has different color and yet some houses which are of similar color
a study of creighton university conducted in 1999 found that employees who were wearing uniforms in different shades of blue felt calm and they also felt more hopeful about their professional roles and competence
and also we have another course which covers not only the structural characterisation but also lots of aspects of cement chemistry and you may also be interested to follow this from epfl
so, this is one way to make sure that when you access a value from a dictionary, the key actually exists, you can use the in function
is the steel reinforcement going to be placed for out of plane moment capacity in the center of the wall along the thickness or is there a possibility of having two reinforcement bars placed at the farthest edges within the cavity
so, if the address where this memory has been allocated is 200, then p will have a value 200
in this class, we will see what a photoresist is
and do you have the habit of writing while you are preparing for exam
and airtel can stop others from using its own mark, this is not the case with a patent if the patent is expired or revoke for whatever reason, when everybody can use that acknowledge
the concrete producer says okay let us look at how to optimize material combinations for sulphate durability choosing the right type of binders, water binder ratio, choice of mix design and so on
5 is not the age for the kids to even separate from the mother’s body
here is another example, which is less commonly used
second terminal from here, and third terminal from here
so, before proceeding to the mechanical modeling, let us understand what the analogous system means
because there are 7 on one side, there are 7 on other side
let see, ah, what static timing analysis this process actually do
because it is working at a very high speed, it is working 1500 rpm
if the i x is the current through some other branch some branch x a and i x is changing to a v 0 is changing; that means, it is a it is actually called current controlled voltage source because these voltage source v 0 is function of the current, that is why it is called current controlled voltage source ccvs in short it is voltage controlled voltage source vcvs right
so, do you think that this is the big difference or a significant difference where the incident field is being introduced into the formulation
and then we have rd from drain to ground, we have c2 and rl
so, usually these studs are always be chamfered
so, for i x what is the value
so, with this so for example, you know i have supposing i wanted to evaluate integral x d x d y
you can be a doctor, you can be an engineer, you can be a manager, you can be a pharmacist
this axial stress ratio is going to zero for us
so that is pretty easy for the common source amplifier with fixed vgs bias
8 degree is there, just you other way you add 360 degree with this, just the way you show vb va that vc lagging minus 240 degree
third, we have deposited chrome gold
that is we have only one electromagnetic wave which satisfy the tem conditions
we have seen this and it is packaged
we said the rotor can be of two types, it can be made up of electromagnetic in which case we call it as wound field
so as an example, supposing we take s which is some csv output and we split it into columns on comma, and then we can take join string and set it to the value comma and then use that to join the columns
so if it has to be attracted the current should be strong enough to nullify the action of a spring and it has to dominate over the spring’s mechanism, only then it will be able to pull it
now, if v 1 it is difference operator
once we have these points, we join them, so the top part of that ellipse we will get
and net flow through surfaces perpendicular to the z axis is going to be partial v z over partially z a b c
but in practice, you also don't want the voltage across the transistor to become very large because it's after all a nonlinear device and that will cause non linearities
he is a pioneering figure in cathodic protection of concrete structures
us structural domain says some kind of net list, inter connections of registers, adders, gates and so on, maybe higher level modules, processor, memory
now this one if you think that your rms value this is the peak value
the rate of change of load with respect to frequency that is your del p l upon delta f can be regarded as constant right, then delta p l delta p f will regarded as a it can be regarded as a constant
something which is very familiar to you, you would have seen it in high school, undergrad alright
so we also discussed that in mathematical term, we can write it as limit t tends to infinity, ht is finite
so specifically we are going to have two portions in the electrical machine, we are going to have one of them as field system the other one we call that as armature system
and when vd equals vs, this function will be 0
let me assume that they are working on 11 kilo volt
as you can see with increasing dosage of fly ashes and slag, we can see a systematic increase in the opi value which shows the positive benefit of having pozzolanic reaction due to fly ashes and slag within your system which improves the resistance of the concrete to gas permeability
so this is a way of accounting for your in one way bending action, vertical or horizontal the clamping forces that can come because of arching mechanism available in masonry
indeof is on
of course it will be affected by the bond but the test protocol gives you the possibility of working with a single unit construction
same way we cannot also find operation amplifier or ic which is ideal
we will right click over here in this change transparency
what i am giving you as a bit of short cut one short cut compared to what most of the books have
see, i take that this is divide by 1000
so, machine will rotate in the opposite direction here, it is shown the in the clockwise direction
the western european and north american countries few time as a linear vision
next, in bringibg this charges, i also done work against potential due to q two, so it be q j
take positive
so, assignment three will basically take you through the, what these calculations, how these calculations evolve, but also the basic assumptions with which these calculations have been made, but it's iterative and empirical based on tests that have been conducted on reinforced masonry and an understanding of the distribution of stresses in reinforced masonry wall cross sections but considering a non linear pm interaction we've actually considered a non linear pm interaction implicitly in this approach itself
so, what this means is that for a particular segment for example the stack segment one can either write to that particular segment or execute from that segment
that means it's reflects direction on or there's a pie face change
let us see what to do when things go wrong with our programs
so, when you are trying to learn a programming language, you would like to start programming and not spend a lot of time understanding where to put colons, semicolons, open braces and close braces and so on
they know that if an operator has a differentiation or an integration then that operator is
you again repeat the process, merge this two vertices and you
so, now i know everything inside this
in order to do so the first thing we observe is that if we subtract a and a~ we would get 6 2 which is essentially +4
and therefore it's possible that you can have a rotation at the base if a crack is already formed at the base
i think this is very interesting because for calculation of depreciation we have seen we want to estimate useful life of a particular asset and that will be the basis for calculation of depreciation
so we will be looking at another demonstration for how the heap works, we will take a small program you could actually download this program from your virtualbox and run this program preferably from your virtualbox
this is my 2 d this is my two variable problem so, my contrast x is simply x 1 x 2 and what i can do is i can plot this for different values of x
this is actually what we're talking about in this case is the joint failure, the joint shear failure
you can either neglect the contribution to the moment capacity by the tensile strength of the masonry or introduce that into the calculations but that's going to be a very small quantity
there cannot be a flow of current in this fashion
hello, welcome to week 5 of this nptel noc course, microwave integrated circuits
now, how do we configure the circuit so that this automatically happens
this is the t logic delay, and then you take care of this skew and jitter
it is often in news, often for wrong reasons that lack of corporate governance has led to some fraud as has led to some problems
so, by unscrewing this, this measuring scale can be rotated and any incline direction also it can be assembled
logic simulation tool is a software that takes a circuit netlist as a input and our test vector as a output
and in this itself, we talked about two types, in one case, the rotor and the stator in between whatever is the air gap that is going to be uniform, completely in which case we call it as cylindrical rotor
so, this is v 0 is equal to 1 volt right so, in this case this i 0 current is entering
so, this equation 1
because this n is a actually stalling speed right stalling speed means it is the speed for which your torque is maximum right, so this is 630 rpm
so, please go through the format two three times
and i put a third charge q at a distance x from them, this is q
so, now we can try to understand the whole problem on infinite solutions why are there infinite solutions
so, if you see on objective if you something like this or objective like this or you can and you will see this is where you fit the objective
so whenever you have some kind of negative slacks somewhere, you have to adjust the delays somehow to make this slack either zero or positive
so, agatha christie is known to have written many murder mysteries
so, so this way dots are used to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage using this dot
so, if you see the expression here, s square plus 12 is there in the numerator and in the denominator we have s into s plus 2 into s plus 3
84v, and i cannot pass the frequency, see the voltage is decreased
so, a flux also it is not it is not visible quantity, only you feel it right
this current let me call it i ok, but if we can write the 2 unknowns as v o is 1 of course, this is output another v p minus v n ok
so with the two differential equations available we can now proceed to work towards a forced displacement relationship
and now in the back tracking, once the sales budget is in place, then the back tracking requires that now you prepare the production budget
like we will see that some of them are integer linear programming based
so, the anode end through a resistance is connected to 5v, and the cathode end is directly connected to pin 7
but in terms of the private members you do not have the privilege of doing that
before we learn more on that let us do a reflection spot
and there are some cost metrics that are quite important, like non recurring unit cost matrix
so, this are the three systems that one could consider for when we are assessing cement
therefore, this is the z axis, carries the uniform surface charge, density, sigma and is rotating with angular speed, omega
one, we can use our protractor divide this 180 degrees into 8 parts
now, let us understand the close relationship between thevenin circuit and norton's circuit
but there may be some saturation involved, there may be some other crossover involved because of which it is not a linear reduction as compared to the armature current been increased
so, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 equal parts we have
the frame is the stationary part of a machine to which are fixed the your what you call this just see this diagram
so, the initial term was 14 years which could be extended to another 14 years
if you do not know the true solution how will you answer that person
so this gate will have thirty three
so, suppose this a b c all of a sudden this, your this, phase is open right
8 degree right
if you calculate this labor mix variance here total for all the three categories of the workers, this will come up as how much
so if i have so many turns like this, all of you know that thumb rule basically that if i am having probably a current in this direction, my finger show direction of the flux lines
cancel
so, same as whatever it is the equivalent one is 5
inventory budget means raw material
right, now it may be because of lack of tuning, it may be because of the financial independence, it may be because of violence, but these are small causes
so, t 1 and t 2 values are known, n i values are known, for example, your t 1 could be 200 kelvin, t 2 could be 300 kelvin in which case the n i values are tabulated we only unknown here is e g
so there are so many techniques, you can see, that people use to control or reduce the power dissipation in all possible ways: at the level of transistors, at the level of gates, at the level of architectures, at the level of algorithms
so, i am making a representation assignment here
normally when we are looking at a synchronous machine i told you that the winding structures are extremely similar for induction and synchronous machine right
alright, now, since a is a constant vector, this part drops, this part drops
so, we have explained the step unit function that for t less than 0, that is your u t is equal to 0 and t greater than 1 sorry t greater than 0, that u t is equal to 1
color combinations also available there, which one can really use that
if they are in shunt like this
0 and 0 right so only these two term survive
so, this much of ohm
just think of that there are number of data members in a, in an object
this is similar to gauss's law for electric field that said that over a suface, e dot d s was equal to charge enclose, divided by epsilon zero
so, you have to see in your time convention which one to choose again
so this is what we see in portland cement paste
so, if you take this example find the equivalent capacitance between your we have seen between terminals 1 and 2 of the circuit you have to find out the equivalent capacitor load
due to higher frequency range, these oscillators are often used asfor sources of radio frequency energy ok
so, they are different decisions which they have to take over a period of time and accounting is a discipline which helps managers and different stakeholders of the businesses to take very relevant and useful decisions
so, this is just a simple double hetero structure base laser
since, the difference is 0, the vo if you if you really go on understanding how the equation comes into picture, if you find out that once you solve this you can find vo equals to 0 minus v 1 by r 1 into r 2
now in simple terms reciprocity in terms of the z and y parameters that we just defined is that z i j is equal to z j i or y i j is equal to y j i
if you have two currents coming into a node and those two currents are unequal, the difference will flow into a parasitic capacitance
but the basic concepts behind these isometric drawings are first of all identifying these principal axis, principal planes, suitably transferring these lengths from each of these views onto these principal planes, through intuitive approach we will join remove the lines and get the object
the incremental quantities are obtained from small signal, incremental analysis which is linear
there are computer packages which are available to construct that and what we will learn is how these softwares, the background of those softwares really works
so, in the operating system you would have a function like this and importantly for us there is a condition, where we check whether this randomize va space is greater than one
lets try to work out this
so let's start preparing the cash budget for the three months starting with the month of january
two and three point at any order
if you just um hold it right so it looks like a ladder will look like a you are what you call the squirrel cage right
so, it means this information for the august we are going to take so it means we are going to take this information for how many months
so, naturally if the current will flow therefore, mmf will be there in the rotor right
oculesics help us to understand what is the level of comprehension of a particular topic
this will be only one, only this
so, it is a because, we will make only for this portion this portion over a half cycle
so, the question is i have interface i 1 and interface i 2 i 2 has coordinates 1 s y 1 right
now, first is a torque current characteristic
so, it's a gravity frame and in many cases reinforced concrete frames even in seismic areas are defined as gravity frames because of non adherence to the code or because many of these structures were constructed before the code actually had specific seismic design guidelines
so, string alright and f is the applied force alright
but by extension it is also associated with the objects whom we touch and the sense of touch which is communicated in our association with inanimate objects
the next point is we have to use compass to mark v s is equal to t s; v, so locate this point as t
7 into 10 cube right and then ixx iyy we can find out right say ixx is equal to 9870 into 10 to the 4 millimetre to the 4 and iy is equal to 510
so, this was the case that also was published on ideo and this demonstrates empathy through observation
so, let me write input impedance of this difference amplifier is this 2 times r 1, where r 1 is this resistance ok; and this is for this type of connection, i repeat for this differential connection without common ground, right
so, if i have, i am having probably it is bound in a particular way it should be manifesting itself the dot and cross in the it opposite sense to that of your armature current that is all, so they will be connected in series with the brushes themselves normally, so if i am carrying only 5 ampere of armature current i want the compensating winding also to create a flux only corresponding to 5 ampere
so, this basis function is non zero only in a some domain of the entire domain it is not nonzero everywhere right that is why the word is self explanatory that is why it is called a sub domain basis function
so, i am doing this change of variable from x y to u v right
in both of these cases, i have a homogenous differential equation which is g double prime equal to 0 solution is linear both sides right
the reason why the diode is connected in this way is, when this switch is on, you will be using this base drive to turn on the vjt
for hard real time tasks, as long as the task completes within its deadline, there is no special advantage in completing it any earlier than the deadline
only at the interface
so, this is actually external electromotive force emf, typically represent by the battery figure 1
so, we look at some of the types of photo detectors and then you will look at a comparison of their gain and the response time, response time is given in seconds
so j is the operator which has the value equal to under root of minus 1 which says that when it is attached to one particular value, then this particular value will become imaginary terms and this will become real term
that means that using positive photoresist, we can retain similar pattern which is on the mask
right those are called higher order elements
so, this explains, while silicon is opaque because visible light has a wavelength less than 1000 nanometers, the visible range is from 400 to 800 nanometers, which means silicon will be able to absorb the visible light and produce electrons and holes
so, for we have not done that so now, let us see how do we evaluate let us say, so which is the equation that we are trying to do
something on the profile plane pick it the projection, rotate that profile plane by 90 degrees
so if you just calculate the wire length here, so it comes to ten
when a high priority task becomes ready, the low priority task must be context switched and the high priority task must run and that should be of the order a few microseconds because the task deadline is hundreds of microseconds
75 plus or minus 0
now if you if you your what you call if you draw the ah your that your long line short ah your short line, medium line, long line those phasor diagram go to that short line phasor diagram then if you take this is reference, this is reference, this is my v r, and current is lagging so this is my current i, right these angle is theta
that is why i connected resistors like this, not resistor like this
is the gap as you have defined before between these two values upper trigger point minus lower trigger point
now deferred means something which is not due today or in the current year which is due in later years
and then we also discussed that real poles lead to exponential functions and complex poles leads to damped sinusoids
5 ohm therefore, e b 2 is equal to 250 minus 0
now to start with this particular series, i have very interesting demo for you
so after placement is done, so the locations of these cells are well, they are, they are aligned to a grid
now as far as the shear design is concerned, how do we go about the shear design
and here we can see the impact of the different loading techniques in terms of this preferential orientation
this is why this is a very challenging research problem and realistic tissues realistic landmines and all they will have high contrast right
so, now, we have to , compute that this this angle angle between current and voltage this angle is alpha this angle is given here alpha
so, next is consider the circuit shown in figure 15 prior to t 0 t is equal to 0, the capacitor c 1 is charged to a voltage v 1 is equal to 100 volt and the other capacitor has no charge that is v 2 is equal to 0 right that is uncharged
third, one cannot be combined in the form of x plus v t alone or x minus v t alone
parasper means mutual cooperation has been given very much of importance
like a black box has a public interface the buttons that you can push to update and query the data type to add things, delete things, and find out what whether the data type is empty and so on
when cmrr is equal to 10 raised to 5, what is the answer
so, this is my phi hat that is what this coordinate system looks like that
you can see that this current source is gm times vgs or gm times vi minus i0 r1 and that itself is the output current
so you used to give your hard copy, notebooks itself or how did you share it
but, we know we have derived it that q 0 is equal to omega 0 l upon r that we have done is equal to you know 1 upon omega 0 c r that also we have done
ceo may not have time, of course ceo is overall in charge of everything but ceo has a particular importance for heading the the finance team of the company then we have already seen there are independence of the director but the independence of auditors are also very important so here we have got auditors which are appointed technically by shareholders but if auditors listen to everything of the board then the independence is lost that's why some principles have been brought in like auditor should not provide other services to the company so that auditor is independent same auditor if auditing for so many years they become too much familiar so you need rotation of auditors so like these various principles new principles are coming in the corporate governance there is one more type of control known as market corporate control now if the company is not doing properly, now there is a market for voting shares and that gives the ultimate control
we have discussed in last slide the mems is nothing but micro electro mechanical systems, that in most general form can be defined as miniaturized mechanical and electromechanical elements such as devices and structures which are made using micro fabrication techniques, alright
kid is more interested in the noise this, he is not interested whether this glass is kept here nicely or not
so, the electric power utility companies measure energy in watt hour or kilo watt hour right
this is a vector quantity
so, silicon actually has a lower band gap than gallium arsenide
we first one: i already mentioned that we do not need an expensive automated test equipment
5 e v, so that carbon is really an insulator
having specified that, now we look into the internals of the classes, if i have to support these member functions, if i have to support the functionality that i want, what are the data members that i will need
so two alternate designs are shown
so, it will be to divide by kr both side it will be 1 plus 1 upon kr into s right into delta e is equal to minus k upon kr into your delta f ir your what you this k, k will be cancelled therefore, and define that t g is equal to your what you call 1 upon kr you define t g right
file manager is different okay account would be profiling that student
so, if you make v and what is the value of v o; at this moment v supply ok; so i can write this as v supply
so, let us look at that also
suppose if i place the modules like this, this numbers indicate the gate numbers
so, supposing we have a value x, name x which can take a value 1, 2, 3 or 4 and depending on whether it is 1, 2, 3 or 4, you want to do four different things with which we called f1, f2, f3 and f4
now, here i should mention that the c that you commonly use is known as c89, c89 is a first standard of c that was created by ansi, the standardization organization and subsequently in 99, another standard was released, this is called c99, so most of the compilers today follows c99 standard
to make you think, visualize things better, let me make in the conventional sense: here is my boundary, here is my z axis, and here's is the charge: q at a distance, z naught [u12]and i want to find potential v, x, y, z in this volume, volume above
so, now let us look at a few more issues
but we update that list inside the function and then if you run it then it does print the value 7 as we expect
whereas, if i am going to have field in the rotor, i will only have basically the field winding which is a dc winding probably and i am going to only bring out these 2 and then i am going to connect them to slip ring
second and the most important concept in op amp is the virtual ground; what is virtual
so, when you talk about oscillators have you ever thought about our body right
so that completes the voltage control current source including biasing, and to ac coupled the current you need an inductor, but you can use a resistor and then take a penalty in the actual fraction of the current that goes to the load
reluctance has decreased lambda has remained the same
many small embedded applications use schedulers like cyclic schedulers or table driven schedulers but more sophisticated applications use event driven schedulers
so, if it is a relatively stable change what should it lead to it
the second point is visible edges behind the cutting plane should be shown
this one when you come that r 1 3; that means, just hold on this is 1 and this is 3 try to find out r 1 3 this is actually r 1 3 then it is star right basically is nothing, but r 1 plus r 2 because other side is nothing is there open
if you bring that other things suppose i want to take it to the secondary side the primary parameters that many things will change including your rp xm everything
i have 3 volts and i have vs and r s which is 100 kilomes in series
now you have the other process which is the attack process which is doing the prime and probe operations
so, next is superposition principle so, this is something like this
so, what will be non zero over here
we have 23 volts here, 20 volts across rd
and let us first try away the simple scheme
so with this we have seen a number of techniques using restructure, ah, netlist, so that some you can say characteristics, which respective timing can be improved, because we need a lot of this kind of corrective actions to be taken
similarly, here i am showing you another industrial process, something like conveyor belts
and how the standard library of c and c++ are used in c++
now, this object is already gone this is been freed up
if the first one is smaller than the second one, it will return it true and otherwise it will return a false
manufacturing process is very simple and the firm has a complete, you can call it expertise in manufacturing those a and b
so as long as the arguments in the load instructions and those of these subsequent instructions are independent it would be possible for the processor to actually execute these instructions in an order which is quite different from what is specified in the program
and on the third axis, the z axis if you want, is the rotation of the load with respect to the bed joint
what about if i am looking side view projection for this point for the same configuration
so, there is a possibility that a particular asset can have two values
so, you have a what you call collective images that people construct and then you map the individuals story over the collective story content and then you interpret it that is nomothetic approach
so, it will be look minus your delta f right this one ah and then your what you call this this is delta e input is here
even for film animations and video games, these days people are using cad software
so, we can convert it into a scalar equation
so, the isometric views, top view, front view these things, you will have it by clicking that
this is exactly as we said like, before, like, saying f is equal to square
we have changed only the portion corresponding to core reset part
now, it is showing that there are some devices, as i have already connected previously
this part is the earlier part and now this is recursive part
it will come after the normal calculation of tax
so this is g
so v1 and v2 we both are applying separately to a resistor r, let us take 1 dc source and we have resistor r, we have another dc source and suppose it is connected thorough some switch
some of the other types of functions which we find associated to strings are to check properties of strings
so, we looked at analysis, we looked at accuracy and in accuracy we looked at for example, dispersion numerical
they have calculated permittivity for healthy tissue unhealthy tissue blood fat cancer all of this thing is tabulated
because if you have surplus cash keeping part of the cash is cash remaining you will invest in the market in the marketable securities right
so, we can then revert to this except statement then say oh if there is key error when i try to append s to scores of b then create an entry scores of b is equal to s
so anyway, ah, this is a circuit
the relay circuit is the same, and this is the additional circuit we are using
only thing is you test test it for impairment if that particular business or product has lost its value then we will write up goodwill we will call it as an impairment but for other intangible assets we will charge depreciation that is known as amortization the calculation is same like for
so, what will it do
similarly these are the time average and the ensemble average
on the bottom axis or the x axis, you find that the customer visits, these are customer visits, when they are few, you have low revenue
so, what went wrong in this scenario
so let us start first with rearranging some of the components and see where we can put the transformer
these days, essentially, because it is extremely difficult to detect whether an ic or a processor or a chip is having a hardware trojan present within it
i will introduce microcontroller boards, we already know what a microcontroller is
they occur with very little awareness
they, though, require some additional hardware, so you are increasing the cost in terms of area or in terms of number of gates or transistors, but this is quite acceptable
so your voltage source will be 20 angles, 0 there will be no change in registers
so, we add few terms in the polynomial and subtract few of them in the polynomial and rearrange in such a way that it looks like s square plus 2 alpha s plus alpha square plus beta square
do you remember what is liquidity ratios stand for
how do these pm interaction curves stack up
rights creation and enforcement is the domain of intellectual property law
you use on your keypad there are buttons like up arrow, side arrow, another side arrow, and down arrow
so here, first we will find the value of zth
you will find that the trademark holder will, in most cases mention the amount of time money and resources, the trademark holder has spent in marketing and advertising
so, the minority carrier which are electrons will get attracted towards the gate, because gate is positive
now, go to features; what i want to do
now what meltdown showed is that with a simple attack exploiting that features of what speculation actually provides a user space program would be able to read contents of the kernel space
because first the flux actually faces, you know a particular slot, corresponding to particular slot the north pole is aligning itself
so, after adjusting the waste ages of the 15% this was expected to be 1,700 kgs so it means standard rate is rupees 4
so i am showing three standard cell rows right now
now, using the poisson's equation, del square a equals minus mu naught j and therefore del square a x is minus mu naught j x and del square a y is minus mu naught j y
so, this works out as 8453088
so, this is the final state diagram which you will get and this will represent these particular differential equation
now as we have seen in the previous gadget when the return executes, we have the address of gadget 3 taken into the program counter and therefore the processor would execute gadget 3 instructions comprising of the mov byte 0 to the offset of esi plus c
next, what we want to do is calculate or right down expression for potential for a charge distribution obtained, an equation, just like the electric field equations for the potential
so, anxiety is qualitatively different is not it
so, 10 by 10 into 100 percent; so, this will be 100 percent; so, huge error 100 percent error
i mean very i mean it is positive side all the ripples will be positive side i mean just hold on
so, it means in order to obtain a schwann cells your source animal source has to be a matured animal
so let me write this as torque electrode magnetic torque divided by k phi multiplied by ra
if that is the case the way how this line is supposed to make 30 degrees, but it should not intersect vertical plane, it should be parallel to that
so, this whole thing is pml and this is my computational domain my object ok
today we will go into owners fund, then we will see the process how the balance sheet emerges and then we will go to discuss what is a profit and loss account
now what i would like to do is with from this environment i will go and adjust these parameters
suppose i say that the input is smaller; then it will be on the left half 0 to 7
so we have now discussed all four cases sensing at either drain or source and feeding back to either gate or source
one simple solution is put an impedance in series here
you know have small chunked modules and also more visual, less text
because accounting period of the firm ends up on is secondary year that is a january to december should there accounting period ends on 31st december
and also because we have been using the same transistor parameters, in fact i didn't even mention that, as usual, mion c
and a good value to remember is that when id 0 is 1 millie amp, that is when the operating point current in a diode is 1 millie amp, we refer to it as the diode being biased at a current of 1 millie amp
so now this is im and this is ic please note that one is resistive current and one is inductive current, so if i show this as a the voltage applied to a transformer for example i am going to have actually, whatever is my ic somewhat like this, which will be in phase because it is resistive current, right
the idea is not to really to understand how exactly it is done, but it is good to know
lets see with the help of an example, but let us see how we insert faults
so just to summarise once again, 1st we find out ql from the given conditions
so, in this case actual price for the actual usage, so what is actual price for actual usage here
let us say you are giving a speech, then i would be sitting here in a distance as an audience i am in your public space
and he is trying very hard
the owner has a copyright in the design, which means the owner can take action against other people who make copies of it without his consent
so, that is our numerical convergence right
some failure can happen in this interconnection or this interconnection or this interconnection
that is through mergers and amalgamation because now it will become a cheaper company for them to take over
so, let us apply so let us switch back to the overhead camera ok
1 second ok; let us take 10 second
so this is instant t1 so i may say that originally it was carrying a current of i, slowly it will come down to 0 and then it has to go the other way around
now, if r 2 dash is separated from r 2 dash by s to replacing the rotor copper loss as a your separate entity the circuit model is shown in figure 8 a right
so, this is curl of h, what do i relate this to
so in reality there is no reinforcement coming to the picture here
these electrons move to the n side and the holes moves to the p side, because of reverse bias and this gets detected as a current
so, let us consider there is a line ab, and we would like to divide that into equal segments; perhaps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal segments we would like to construct
similarly here, it is between ground and the terminal
7, 3
so checkpoint heuristic is a very quick method to do this fault collapsing right, and this is often used in practice
another one is piezo resistive, applying force or pressure will show change in resistance,
a wiki is a good way to get students to work on a collaborative project which may need several days or several weeks of work on it
so, the higher figure will mean that the in relation to sales the operating cash flows have been low
so, similarly the other side also it can go like this
so, we can write it in either terms
i told you that at the past in the past at some time, capacitor will remain uncharged
as of now we can see these two are not aligned parallel to each other
see, this function was not there in the earlier multimeter
once again here in this case for a, if you drop of vertical line here this will be the value of v p something let me write this something ok
so, an inclined plane on which one will be going to fix a drawing sheet and a compartment to keep your reserves like pen, pencils, and drawing equipment
6 that is 5 kva right because power factor is 0
now i have shown 2 methods of doing this, one using quarter wave transformer quarter wave transformer and the other using normal transmission lines along with shorted stubs
second term will be now you can see the pattern delta to 2 delta
now, the energy stored same as before in the capacitor is given by minus infinity to t p dt right
you know there aren’t any ten micron pores in that
now, the order in which you take these cells for placement: it can be either random or driven by some heuristics, like, for example, ah mean at every stage you have been, you consider all the remaining cells
i am 25 years old
similarly, i can write here current whereas this will be in amperes and here it is going to be flux which will be in webers, right
each time we can start with 1 and each time we find a larger common factor we can discard the previous one, we do not need to remember all the common factors we only need the largest one
so when you convert, let us say that the phase voltages are van, vbn and vcn and we have already discussed that line line voltage of wye connected source leads their corresponding phase by 30 degree and root 3 times the magnitude
so you have to do wet grinding but of course not with water
always check that you are getting a physically meaningful solution over here
if i say that if i want to achieve a speed greater than 1500 rpm that means i have to go for a voltage also which will be higher than this normal rated voltage
let just confirm this
so, basically whenever we find v in the tree and that can only be one v remember this is not like deleting from the list that we had before where we were removing the first copy of v in a search tree we have only one copy of every value if at all
so this is local skew
so is divergence is going to be the sum of the partial derivative of x component with respect to x, partial derivative of y component with respect to y and partial derivative of z component with respect to z
o’conner has found that frequent gesturing is highly correlated with people who were perceived by others to be leaders in small groups
there is still a comparator and a d/a converter, very similar to a tracking type adc; just the up down counter is replaced by a successive approximation register and this implements actually the logic, which we mentioned depending on whether the output of the comparator is 0 or 1 it takes a decision
and what is the common mode gain
for non profit organizations like trust and societies it is called as income and expenditure account
now that we have understood how we perceive things, we are now moving a step ahead trying to understand that having sensed the world having perceived the world around us how do we learn things
and the roll off rate for this one is minus 20 db per decade
so it is very important to characterise those strands to meet the acceptance criteria, to be used in the structures
we have to select a ; select a line which shows true length for example, 30 mm side supposed to be the true length if that is the thing, then we have to pick such kind of line
all standard library headers in c++ do not have any dot h in their file extension, this is for a historical reason which i would try to explain at a later point of time, but please note that io stream dot h should not be included and the last box in this matrix that if you are writing a c program and you want to use a c++ header certainly is not applicable because you cannot do that c++ has a lot of features which c does not support and therefore, such a use cannot be done
so, v 2 is equal to minus 160 volt
there are other fancy things like s dot title
now, when you make a cut, as i have said, you do the cut considering the cut size minimization problem
so, that is why this is written as v s u t
and what he did was he wrote a big long letter to the then president of or the story goes from the internet
so, this let me just give you the name ok, because i cannot write this big expression in the small space
suppose, this is 0, this is pi and this this is 2 pi
but a you can move, but it still remains eleven, it does not reduce
it is a little known fact that the feet are two of the most expressive parts of our bodies; let us see what we can discover about what our feet and legs communicate
the units here are crucial n c and n v the square root of that should have the units of centimeter cube or per meter cube
if the impedance is 10 percent calculate the regulation at full load for power factor 0
as long as the different tasks meet their deadlines the real time system would have achieved its goal, there is no point in completing the tasks very fast that is not the objective
because three times whatever is the single phase unit directly you can multiply because each of them will be able to handle a kva corresponding to the single phase kva rating
and, even the small amount was enough to increase conductivity by orders of magnitude
now this particular board is mbed enabled
you need a contact between polysilicon and diffusion
this is one of the main advantages of three phase using three phase system right
so basically you got a family of curves
so, we are supposed to pay salary on 31st of the month or 30th of the month
here a simple priority inversion occurs when t2 is simply waiting for t10, but then the unbounded priority inversion occurs where tasks which are of lower priority than t2, they start executing because they are higher priority than t10 and t2 undergoes many priority inversion, one due to t10 initially, then later due to t5, t3, t7, etc
no the boundary conditions in maxwell’s equations
in the last lecture, we have learnt the basic elementary methods of mating that are available in solidworks that are generally used in assembling the parts in product design
wwe increase athe voltage, it will just detect the peak it will detect the peak
there will not be any floating value anywhere
so, in this part where we are talking about various digital voltmeters, so we have studied linear ramp type voltmeter and dual slope voltmeter
so and also you can evaluate fault coverage and you can compare alternate sets of test vectors, like you have, say, two test cells, t one and t two
intangible assets are those assets which you can't touch or feel
x = g
and after that, when we went for, say, adjusting for the amount for collections and payments, so we are left with the excess of deficit of cash
and again, there is a heat sink
so, v infinity is 60 volt; v 0 we calculated 30 volt 60 volt e to the power minus t by 8, so it is 60 minus 30 into e to the power minus t by 8 volt right
so, whenever we have a drawing board, to hold this is the board ; we will like to hold the drawing sheet on that drawing board, this is the paper
satisfiability problem is a very well known problem in switching circuits where, given a boolean function in some special form say, for example, the product of some forms the sat solver will trying to find out whether there exists some combination of the input variables for which your given function is equal to one
so, you have the steel rods running on two sides of the wall which is then tightened and then the jack can actually introduce the necessary diagonal compression and then you make measurements along two diagonals that being one diagonal and that as the other diagonal of course there is going to be a certain difference between such a test and the laboratory test because of this area which is still in contact with the with the wall because if you if you isolate the whole, it's as good as taking it out, taking into a laboratory and testing it
so, those variables could be global, those variables as we will see could be static members, those could be the parameters that you got as alias in the formal parameter, those could be dynamically allocated values and so on
this is the vector quantity
and also, while doing hand calculations, we will assume vd not to be 0
so, i am going to have normally in a stator if this is a and this is a dash i am going to have between these two i will have exactly 180 degree shift
because at the at the start this part is 0; that means, ultimately affecting impedance is getting reduced because of that starting current is higher because this part is 0 right
but actually when we procured the material from the market we found it for say 13 rupees per unit
but one kids are developing the certain fears which are natural fears
this is a cash operating profit
we knew the helmholtz equation we knew green's function right and when you how to deal with singularities go over the three building blocks which we have buy now very comfortable with ok
they tried to introduce the fruit beer also but couldn't succeed in the market
now this network that is that between the transistor and the load is called the output matching network
this is not what nature as given as we are doing these manipulations to get these desired objectives out of it that is
similarly, if it is if the base is inclined at different directions, we will have a view in this way
so, this way you can draw the circuit, even you will see one or two problem that how to solve using this kind of circuit right
so, what is this what is an interpretation of this general equation that i have
so, this is this will be true when we are having say interfacing using say normal operation so say when we are having say this is they
because, i need three points to uniquely specify a parabola right
so, though it was not very formally discussed and organized, c also has this kind of a concept in terms of function pointers
in today’s rapidly evolving landscape of creativity, we can see how artificial intelligence and machine learning plays a role
and no other material, right
no, see the amount of information is fixed by the size of the object
if id is greater than i 0, then this voltage goes on increasing
15 by degree centigrade into 50 minus 50 which is 50 which is equals to 3
items which were related to ca or cl or related to working capital, they are yet to be treated
if you measure the area fraction on a surface it is the same as the volume fraction providing the sample is statistically isotropic, you do not have very preferred orientation and providing your sampling is big enough
so as of now, this approach also like on a cantilever say, for example, here you have a cantilever having embedded electrode or embedded electrode systems
so, we do an insert kind of thing find the position in this case m to swap with k after swapping it we take the suffix after the new letter we put namely m and we reverse it to get the smallest permutation starting with that letter m
now, you see we are moving towards understanding the integrated circuits and how we can fabricate a mosfet
so, in this period this is connected to v r
so, what we will do is pick a line from somewhere of certain mouth, it goes there all the way down end
so, it would definitely entail a huge amount of loss, right
and as we have just discussed, it executes through the initialization list
so, this circuit is better ok
an uncontaminated concrete will have very high ph which is about 12 more than 12 and that is the reason why we are actually able to use steel in concrete because at this high ph steel does not corrode or it is very protective when the ph is very very high like this
it can help us in planning our answer properly
but lets say there some constraints regarding this cells
so, activity planning can be done, level of activity planning can be done looking at the profit potential, looking at the contribution of any product towards the profitability and then taking the decision accordingly
second stage is partial section compressed and we have an estimate of the maximum compressive stress
now, first one is journal
now we are going to start with discussing, in fact brainstorming how this prototype should be, what
now this very transformation, at the level of retina, the rod cells and the con cells, the light falls and the cis configuration becomes in the trans state
so, what we are going to do is that we are going to traverse the heap and look at the various metadata contents present in the heap
second cost is the works cost when in the prime cost you add up all factory overheads then it becomes the works cost or the factory cost and then when we add all office and administrative overheads then we calculate the cost of production and then we calculate add up the selling and distribution overheads in the cost of production then finally we say arrive at the cost of the product to be sold in the market or you can call it as cost of sales
for example, you learn how to ride a bicycle
mention it, it is a circle
now, when we find out the short circuit current we will come to know that short circuit current is nothing but the norton's current, how
so, we are talking about just a single op amp
and only this term and this term will be remaining, so that is what we have kept here only the remaining 2 terms, so since this is also a reciprocal network we have defined our network like that
so, that is how these two functions i mean that is how the green’s function can be written
and then there is an accelerating gear grid then there is a deflecting plates and here is a bending magnet
now the derivations for these terms are given in this book by pozar, as mentioned in the syllabus for this course, if you wish you can go through them
so, unknown and are they functions or just scalars
so now for calculating the labour mix variance, labour mix variance or the gang composition variance
so, this central part is most ideal region is the best region where the precession of our measurement will be most it is accuracy will be most
so, if z cd is very small, then we are connecting a very small resistance impedance across a high voltage source ok
you can only refer
now before that we have to first find out the value of rab, that is equivalent resistance across terminal ab
so, that is that will be your what you call v1
23 this is the 13
from this direction, we have to observe the top view of the car, that means, we cannot straight away see any wheels, we cannot straight away see anything like these inside of that parts
so, here just a conceptual understanding as to what is an income
so, this will become; so, a constant 5 will become a constant 6, which is not possible
and, we will also see the state equation in the today’s session
so, b square j j minus 4 c j j is approximately equal to b j j, right
so, now, i focus only on this candidate function
i 1 is again 0
it is going to be 1560 rupees 1560
whenever we have given that your what you call that sinusoidal and phasor and that emf equation were the beginning of the single phase circuit the same philosophy right
and self stressing system, you have significant expansion that leads to significant compression, we will come back to it
means we know it that the labor worked for 2,000 hours and 12 hours work was 120 hours total labor hours 120 hours there was no say production or the machines could not work or the labor could not work for that we have already calculated the labor either time variance so it means now we have to find out that what actually is the standard time that is 1 880 for which actually the labor has worked and we have to compare that with the actual time and then we have to see that whether it is same or any kind of the difference prevails in that
but x, you cannot change within the function
so, you again call the next one which is the destructor of the base class which will print b
for simplicity we can write v 1 as in place of v 13 and v 2 in place of v 23 because we know that this is always be with reference to reference node
this is based on a standard design rule called mosis
you should typically choose a number of receivers to be at the sampling limit
so the failure surface is not the shape of the failure surface is not unique
therefore, whatever it comes; that means, it will be ; that means, if i draw the equivalent circuit of this one, suppose, then i have only one , your 100 volt source and one resistance is like this, forget about this part
here is a technology enhanced learning metrics which includes effectiveness which entails learning of content and skills, it includes accessibility which entails reaching to large numbers and diverse groups attractiveness which entails attracting learners by engaging them, motivating them and visual attractiveness
secondly, is this e m is this current that is flowing is it dc
this is a third situation in which a thorough structural assessment becomes required
at some point x, y, z with x axis this way, y axis this way, z axis this way, and this is point x, y, z
so, imagine that you have a test setup where you set the value of vgs to be 3 volts and vds to be something so that it is in saturation region and you can measure all kinds of things about the transistor
first, is skew
so, 2 ohm 4 ohm and 2 ohm this 3 resistors are in series
and you can also try what happens if it is in cutoff
so, quantum optics is a very interesting field as well; those equations look a little bit different, but the idea is the same
the next step is to take a mask to do the alignment and the exposure
the 1970 act was after india became member of the world trade organization in 1995, the act amended three times, in 1999, in 2002 and in 2005
but i have 2 floats i will get a float, division, on the other hand will always produce a float if i say 7 and divided by 2 , for instance where both are ints i will get an answer 3 point 5
so, that is why this is the phasor diagram
if m e star and m h star are the same, if these 2 are the same, which means n c and n v will also be the same then e f i will be exactly at e g over 2 or, if temperature were 0
so, in this case, it is coming basically, it comes 2 upon pi after simplification into i m is equal to 0
so this method, ah you can see, is very simple and, ah, pretty obvious
so, i have just taken the volume integral approach here this is the field observed at a distance r prime
16 degree per unit and z 3 is equal to 1
so, easy extremely easy, now you know what is the voltage at the output of this particular variac, correct
now we have spent say 20 million rupees to buy a plant or to install a plant and the production capacity of that plant is how many that is 10,000 units
so, what do i mean by inside the medium
4 degree ampere , right, , and for wattmeter reading power p 1 it will be v a n i a into cos theta v a n minus i a ; that means, ; that means, your , for this wattmeter it is connected here
once it is done mark these points, p5, p6, p7 and p8 is always be at a
it is also an invitation to communicate, it shows attraction if one over does it, it can also be an intimidating gaze
you can also see how closely it resembles the source follower circuit
when you prepare the profit and loss account, the first part of that firm that profit and loss account is what that is the trading account trading account of the firm trading and profit and loss account so upper part is called as the trading account and lower part is called as a profit and loss account so what you take here you take here the direct material you take here the direct labor and you take the direct overheads right here then we take here buy sales we put here two it is two and then we put here first the sales and then we put here by closing stock right so this total amount of the production this this means the defects the total amount of the production the firm has part of the production is sold in the market and part of the production is available with us and kept as a closing stock for selling in the next period and from this total, for example this comes out as 1 lakh rupees, right
so, if we give the number 8 then we will get one solution like this the it turns out that you can actually change that print board function i would not show you the code, but to print it out in a more user friendly way
so, the box in the glass box method car might be in any inclination, but if we are going to decide this one i would like to have a front view i would have placed the car in that direction
so, all these promotions and conversions are also used for overload resolution
so pleasure information goes in this direction: pressure data, but temperature data we will perhaps not go all though it is coming from the same node
here, for an object of this shape this one what we have shown as 1
so, in when you design the circuit you make sure that you are you are output voltage is 0 when your input terminals are grounded
so, actually this whatever value we choose right, that actually determine the steady state frequency versus load characteristic of the generating unit as shown in figure 6
this is a common one which takes the object as a call by reference, as a reference object
you can have irregularities on the brick surface and therefore there will be concentration of stresses in some points and smaller level of stresses in other points
so compiler, at the compilation time at the static time could not have decided as to whether a colon colon f will be invoked or b colon colon f will be invoked this will be decided later at the time of execution that is why this is called late binding
and i am going to have this as the power factor angle
so, thereafter f we draw these lines here also we draw these lines, draw this vertical and so on
so, this is scattered field far away either in 2 d or 3 d right
the third thing is: you are bound to live in a world where there has to be interoperability
but one thing you remember: but these two dummy junctions actually represent the same net
so, these are respectively the voltages between line abc and the neutral
so now if you see this particular equation the relationship between voltage and power is not linear
so, there should be no confusion about this ok
and it can be administered to anybody who is ten years of age or above now what happens here you show the card and you ask the individual to narrate story to construct and narrate a story
so, if i have a hindi speaking group i will have to have the informed consent form which is either only in hindi or english and hindi, if i have different language group, i have to take care of the language of the participants so that whatever is a retained in the informed consent form the participants can understand it easily
specifically in this experiment we will be interfacing a relay, a speaker, a ldr and lm35
this is your what you call that ah that diagram, that you are here is delta e this is the delta e this output of the governor right and, this is going to your what you call that your turbine then generator right
so, it will be 20 because at this point say, this is point a, this is point b, we are trying to find out r thevenin, so it will be 20 into 20 by 20 plus 20 this is your r thevenin you have to find out
now, as i said, p average can be computed by dividing the energy divide with this time t
and for illustration, let me assume that the supply voltage is 15 volts
so, here we are saying h z is equal to 0 here we are saying e z is equal to 0 ok
you can see there is a motor down below and there is a wheel that is connected to the shaft, which can rotate
so, let us now consider that my v non inverting that is voltage in non inverting terminal is 1 volt voltage at inverting terminal is 2 volt
this is quite simple to understand
so what is done for those cases is that single segment pi model pi model is used for estimating the l more delay in those cases, short wire segment s
for example, in a family a child may be taught never to look angrily at his father or never to show sadness when disappointed
for all you know, presence of the panel in the basement or in the ground story would have actually saved the structure
so to get some insight into the operation, this is good enough
so similar to the setuid we also have a setgid, given a group identifier which sets the group id that particular process, now every time we fork and create a new process, which i will process would in the group id in a very similar way as it inherits the uid of its parent process
we will talk about this definitely when we talk about transformer in a greater detail, is that clear
can you think of any such example that a particular item is in balance sheet and because it is in balance sheet it will come in cash flow without coming in p&l
now what we have to do is, draw a vertical line through this p
but it does not know what that type is, what it does not know how the type is implemented and it does not care because it is just looking at a reference
now, what you have to do
so, although it looks like the lengths are equal, but there can be some parasitic, resistance and capacitance effects, right, and these parastics may not be the same for both the lines because it depends on the lines which are running parallel to those lines on the same layer across different layers
all these are restrictions that the owner of the copyright can impose on a person who has purchased the book
and all i have done is to replace this two port with the small signal linear model of the mos transistor
the starting point is both colored yellow and green
so, p m is equal to 80 kilo watt, so p m is equal to 1 minus 0
in this video we had a brief introduction to intel sgx in the next video will look at how a move from a software perspective and see how applications are written how the sgx mode is used and how data can be transferred from a normal mode outside the enclave into the enclave and get the result and so on, thank you
so, once again i am writing for you v is equal to v m by root 2
so, machine cycle is one twelfth of the piston clock and this piston clock is divided by sorry the machine cycle is divided by 16 so, that will give you the delay for the timer
once again these numbers are different, because you have electrons that are moving in the conduction band and holes that are moving in the valance band
what i am saying is something like this: take a multi input gate
so, it will be of interest for us to know cost of material consumed is what percentage of the revenue
so, let us try to calculate the current ratio
it may be possible that some of the material is already available with us in the godown
answer is yes because company has paid cash for it
if f equal to zero means both e and c are zero, f zero means both c and e are zero and d zero means anyone of them can be one
so, this if, whereas this is going to be ia, which is flowing from my armature supply
and this standard is hierarchical, so you can work it at the chip level, p, c, b level and also the system level where there is there are multiple such boards connected
impedance of free space right
learning basically is relatively stable change relatively permanent change in the behavior which is basically a byproduct of experience, fine
and what this means is now that, we can also use g of a, b, c and it will mean the same as f of a, b, c
so, here also if the ratio is higher, the company is considered to be more risky or it can also be calculated for a particular project
in c++ certainly it is come out to be a built in type
let us see for this simple mobile phone class how do we make the definition, so we have created the class with the name mobile phone for each of the functionality that, we see they will have to be some member functions associated
then name after dividing that ao, ae into same number of equal parts, let us say 5
now, let us see one more term; what we have seen until now, input offset voltage, then we have seen input bias current
so, if you look into the circuit here it will be v l is equal to l into di by dt and here v r is equal to i r right
so, now let us proceed further, let us now put in now what does it that we have to choose
so now, what we have done
so, this thing from here to here , from here to here right, from here to here this is my x l and from here to here this is an x c
so you do not need to dry the sample at all and in fact, just the opposite
so, though there is an improvement that the inventor has made with regard to the internal combustion engine, it will be very difficult for people to ascertain where that improvement is, unless the inventor himself tells the world as to what was the contribution that he made
if this block, we will like to project it
now let us look at some critical waveforms
so, because q c is we are taking at a kilowatt
the dynamic nature of nonverbal communication is best studied during interactions only and therefore, this parallel with linguistic meaning in terms of words, sentences and paragraphs has to be kept in mind whenever we look at the body language and try to interpret it in others
you will always encounter the rms value
so, we are showing that one as hatched lines
now, you see vd set equals to vgs minus v t we know that
r1 = r2 = 10 kilo ohm
for example, so i was discussing the three types of conductor, three types of microstrip lines for analysis
so, it is consisting with the definition of del h and these e x, e y, e z they are captured in this del e del e term ok
i am doing the integration over f d r plus now i have an integration over f d f
now, what would be the value of t equivalent circuit parameters
so, basically whenever the current flows in a particular element it tries to oppose the flow of current
but when we get to this point at which the all the capillary left, pores left are these inter hydrate pores, you see the gel pores are just stabilizing
so, we can now dope a p type material in this silicon
i would say few requirements, so i will take a fresh page and i will start with a requirement
see what can be there possibility that we have given the standard input, two units, three units, four units of a, b and c products and that the raw materials
so it means 1,000 into 10 kg multiplied by 2
so, this is the voltage that means, voltage from 0 to 2, it is a time varying
375 units with plus or minus 0
we can look at this aspect of our behavior in crowded places, elevators, trains, seating arrangement in restaurant offices, as well as an individual preferences regarding the seat we occupy in any crowded place
for example, here we are showing an aircraft, what should be the surface
in comparison to these two theories, we find that the third theoretical approach is slightly different
now, i write down this curl of e operator right so, x hat y hat so i will just write it ones for clarity
5 oms now this is a significant drop now this is a very ideal component to have in this kind of a circuit where during the start up the cold value is very high limits the current and during the normal steady operation of the circuit the thermister which would have become hot imposes impedance of around 0
so, this is one way to find out steady state ah this is one way to find out the steady state values for example, suppose here it is 4 into 4 that is why on the plane paper we can do it
so, plus minus and so, whatever voltage is here same voltage is here because no other element
p type material once that is done; what is the next step
we apply this input signal to the non inverting terminal of the amplifier
in this case, what would happen is that whatever m is produced, it'll also have m dot n or m cross n at the surfaces, and that will give rise to an additional h and the dependence will not be directly proportional to b, so that will be slightly more complicated
so, after that knowing the theoretical, say the conceptual part of the budgeting, we are now into the cases, small mini cases we are discussing
then, to look at top view, he has to go observe the from top side whatever this projection he is going to get onto that plane
then under the priority inheritance scheme, what is the maximum duration for which the task t
so, there is a shape, there are two kinds of shape that is basically polygonal shapes and closed curves like closed conics, there could be others also
the actual term chronemics was coined in 1972 by fernando poyatos, a canadian linguist and semiotician
and how far is too far very much depends on the context that you are working in
and i can check that this and satisfy the wave equation with velocity being equal to new times lambda
so this c and d are actually interchanged because you can see there are two horizontal slices
so, old variac with me now, the way i have placed here
in fact, i would like to add something say usually the kind of complaints that parents receive is not from the activity teachers; the drawing teacher, the music teacher, the sports teacher
here, representing chain dimension instead of that we go with parallel dimensioning
in japan there is a word for someone who is worthy of praise overcoming a challenge
so, when you compile incoming and outgoing currents you can say that 10 upon s plus 1 minus the node voltage v naught divided by 10 will be the value of this current plus 2 and 0
now if i want to operate or if i want to use the circuit in a high frequency range from 200 kilo hertz to few gigahertz can i use the similar rc phase shift oscillator or wein bridge oscillators
so this path is very very important without this path this transformer isolated forward converter will not work
let us again go back and refresh our memory here, over here when i wrote down this weak form, i got one term on the right hand side but, if i had this green case over here then, there were 2 integrals right
so what we are doing is that we are trying to decrease the slacks to zero by increasing t v and t e
so this reuse model takes into account two things, the black bus code that is reused without change and the code that has to be adapted to integrate it with the new code
wherein you may have the dependent variables as v1 and i2
why so much discussion because later on it is going to be added to a and keep in mind that a, that is share capital is a very important item
essentially, electric field becomes a two dimensional world and i know, indeed, there the field goes s over r
so, my v thevenin will be is equal to this is x m
you can see that it can be used as a computer itself
and when i take a divergence of a vector i get a scalar
so one way to do this is by introducing another gadget known as the gadget return which essentially points to a gadget containing just 0xc3
so, it is equal to same thing v square g is equal to v is 100 volt, and g is 100 square into g is 0
now i am drawing id versus vgs plot for drawing id versus vgs plot
this is basically the income statement or the profit and loss account or trading and profit and loss account, whatever the name you want to call it as
now, the problem would be that since we have only one equation and we have two variables means we need at least one more equation to solve this circuit
by default we say, the c program has a fall through control, which means that once a statement has been executed then the immediately next statement in the program code will be the next statement to be executed, but we can change that by the control flow
so it could be a sad emoji there
why are reflection and articulation important, why should we include such activities
and we had centres for consultancy in the major universities in and higher technical institutions in india
so, we will get some value that because this has to be positive this has to be positive or or this one has to be negative this one has to be negative, such that rl square minus l by c less than 0 and your rc square minus l by c less than 0 if both are negative then it will be positive then you will get some value of resonance frequency right, but iflet me clear it, but if your what if if it if it happens
so, this is my d x this is my d y, this is the stencil that i have
so, this phenomenal growth of intellectual property came through an international and a national arrangement
so, directly i am writing this you will get e b 1 is equal to 215
now gt upon gtu will be given like this
theta r cross theta gives me minus phi and therefore k becomes m sine theta phi
so, how do we technically try to null the output voltage vo
so, definitely voltmeter resistance is much higher i mean voltmeter resistance ideally is infinite practically several maybe several kilo ohms
now, interfacing is also not quite difficult
so, the way you have studied, your simple parallel circuit for dc circuit analysis
first thing i do in this case is the continuity equation and driving all these relationships
that is this operator, output operator is a binary one and it takes two operands; if you look into this the left hand side operand is a c out object and the right hand side operand is a d 1 object
so this is a guide, this is from american concrete institute 223r, guide for the use of shrinkage compensating concrete exists
so this h and x and two alternative ways which typically people build, the first level clock tree before they are distributed to the different parts of the trip
so, for this range of slip, the load resistance in the circuit model
on the left is a return type and on the right within this pair of parenthesis, we have the parameters
so, i will spin coat photoresist
so, directly we are given here, we have the direct material which is required for manufacturing the product which is this form, alpha india limited manufactures
now it is actually entering the terminal and when the current is leaving the plus terminal you take minus sign, at the same time you can understand that actually the i the current is going into the element from plus
but suppose in an alternate mapping, if we put a and b within the same partition, then the connection between a and b, the delay, can be only x, and also the c, if you can put it on the same board, then the delay between p and c can be b and c can be only ten
though we have access to individual positions or individual slices or sequences within a string, we cannot take a part of a string and change it as it stands
so this is one thing: you should separately consider rise delay and fall delay, and you can also, you should incorporate signal integrate extensions to the simple analysis we just now consider, which means that if a neighboring wire changes state, there will be an capacity of coupling on some wire and that wire can also incur some additional delays
12 also compute the energy for the interval, t is equal to 0 to t is equal to infinity right
so, you cannot have compromised strengths of the grout
for this approach to work what must be true about k
roughly speaking, lambda is indicative of the size of the smallest transistor
it will, which will take two variables a, and b and try to swap them
so lets name the gates: g, g one, g two, g, three
it is no longer going to be fb but a value that will be lesser than fb but governed by tension, governed by the tension steel and therefore in zone 3 the difference is that fm 1 is not predetermined as a value equal to fb, but fm1 is estimated based on what the value of fs is
half right
combined with the function template this gives us a major advantage in terms of being able to write generic programming, meta programming code and gives a foundation of what is known as a standard template library or stl of c++
so, l into d i l upon dt is equal to v m sin omega t right
so, we have already come across this trick earlier integral equations always solved in 2 steps
if you look at the bonding character in this compound semiconductors iii v are mainly covalent, mainly have covalent bonding, they do have some ionic character in them the main bonding is covalent
so, i am going from the point a to b along the contour and i want to find out integral d l ok
lets say, this is the set of all possible responses and this is the set of compacted information
as usual pause this learning dialogue, write down your answer and then you may resume
so, the common source amplifier using drain feedback
those are, 3wire strands which has 6 mm diameter and next one 7 wires strands with 12
so v0 and f is a generic variable
so, v is equal to 6 volt , but your current is i is equal to minus 4 ampere ; that means, the direction of the current will be reverse so; that means, if i for yours understanding if i draw it like this
now what caused that depletion
this is a circular one of 16 mm we construct, 16 mm diameter; that means, 8 mm radius
ok, so we define the probability of analyzing as the ratio of the number of faulty bit streams that map to the golden signature
gradually with a passage of civilization, it was reduced to a roman salute where the hand was carried towards the heart
then they can think of make a use of this source and they can say have some some some financial help from the financial institutions other than banks
now, in order to designate that the x and y belong to this point and no other, we prefix it by self
1, 10 to the minus 31, h which is plancks constant and e f is 5
sorry, now when theta is equal to 0 right when theta is equal to 0, then a b is equal to 0, then a b is equal to your what you call is equal 0
so, i want to be able to simulate and predict what are the fields given some obstacles
so, i look for the next match, i skip, but the next match must come to my right
so, let us write with the application of fleming’s right hand rule, we can find the direction of induced emf
and this one if you multiply by 10 square that is 100 you will get 19 ohm or vice versa, right from that you can check whether calculation is correct or not, right
so, using these kind of splines one will be in a position to construct it
so, now, this was the case which we discuss in the last class to in today's class, we will discuss more about case 2 that means, if the network has dependent sources, so, in that case what we have to do, we have to turn off all the independent sources only that means that we will only turn off the independent sources while we leave the independent sources connected to the circuit
we see how better the interest is covered
so, this line is terminated at capacitor c
but just cannot be algebraic sum, right
5 so if you take this amount this will work out as 8 divided by 18 and 26
so, you see the disparity in the values of fnd which do not give us clarity on how physically the phenomenon is occurring with the cracking in the brick unit leading to loss of confinement in the motor causing crushing failure in the motor itself
so we considered basically a system somewhat like this
then immediately python points to that semicolon and says this is a syntax error it is invalid python syntax
it has to get connected somewhere so that this i 0 has some path to flow and it has to go to vdd where it can't be connected directly to vd because in that case that is like shorting the output of the amplifier to ground
so, these are a few of the examples
now, larger super mesh can be used to apply kirchhoff voltage law
1 r 1 is 10 kilo ohm, gain is 0
so this is something that we need to look at a little bit in detail because there are some do's and don'ts clearly as far as semi destructive and destructive tests are concerned
now a wave that is travelling a wave has travelled from a simulation domain over here let us call this the z axis a wave has travelled like this is and there is no reflection as we have seen there is no reflection
you can for current also, you can course the changinge or you can fine the tune it
can i calculate for the same situation, same fixed charges, fixed conductors, if i now change the density and bring in some other rho two, r, prime, let's call this rho one and some other charges
so, you can see the signal input signal and then we can also see the corresponding output signal right ok
if the current factor is smaller than expected, vgs increases
and we know that five to seven percent of global co2 emission is attributed to portland cement manufacturing
ok, so the segment on which the wires run are also aligned, as i had said
so, i can just write primes without actually giving a size and just give the initialization list what c compiler does it finds out how many elements you have initialized it with, and assumes that is the size of the array or those many elements will be there
once you add them that is a right bottom mix and then between that and the next when you see the difference that is purely by high shear mixing, you have just mixed it for 5 to 7minutes at extremely high shear to break all the particles to release the water from all the agglomerates and now then you add the last one third of water and the superplasticizer and you see the mix being extremely fluid and then you add steel fibers and mix it and i will show you the mix is so good that even with that flowability there is absolutely no bleeding or segregation and you see a very cohesive very dense mix and it is very hard to believe that this is a 0
since this is ah in phi direction, it's easy to use the cylindrical coordinates
so, the problem remains the same i had some object v 2 over here and some v 1 and this was my current source over here
so, directly can write all these problems we have solve like is like your single phase circuit
if i look at the rotor current, rotor current i may write it as i2 dash which is very similar to the current that is reflected from the secondary side of the transformer to the primary the same way here from the rotor side it is going to get reflected to the stator side
and, what i will do i will, i also have to make sure that the counter is not counting in this region right
so, this current source is open and this voltage source here it is short circuited right
5 kilo hertz, 1 volt peak to peak to the 5 kilo hertz, 1 volt peak to peak to the i to the input of the operational amplifier or input of the peak detector um
a typical example would be a function which just displays a message like there was an error or it displays some other indicative things for you to understand what your code is doing
and then let me take a switch the switch can connect to either these or this or this
in the previous class we talked about the different components which make management accounting as a subject and we were talking about the contents of the contents of the management accounting and when you talk about the contents we have discussed about the full cost accounting we have talked about the differential accounting and we have been talking about the responsibility accounting right so i told you in the previous class that responsibility accounting is another technique of management accounting i would say where the whole firm is divided into different responsibility centers
you call ac steady state as the steady state when you consider r plus j omega l as the impedance
so, this inner product and all of this stuff what does it boil down to; this inner product collapses, the integral collapses i am left with phi n and then what will happen, how do what happens of the left hand side
and it is better to keep him in a twin sharing so that there is someone else also who can raise an alarm if required
so without all this things this would be my whole chip
so, total field is the sum of incident and scattered field intuitively they are always made sense, but now we are seeing it mathematically
similarly, the largest permutation is one in which all the elements are in descending order, so we start with the largest element m and we work backwards down to a
so, you could have for example, if you have a donor type impurity that could lead to a donor level that is closed to the conduction band, it could also have acceptor levels close to the valence band
these are all the supporting l e d's which simply switch on moment the sense that the light is ah low
it depends on the previous history it depends on what happened previously
if net flow in flow in a through a small volume is 0 and at that point divergence is going to be 0
a kid who can sit quiet is i have not given any activity to the kid also, he is just sitting and listening not jumping, not doing i have lot of kids were grown up
so if we require magnetic via media first of all i will need a field system which will create the magnetic field and whenever electrical energy is ultimately given out in generator or electrical energy is taken in a motor this will be through bouquet of conductors which is generally known as the armatures system
687 x 10 6
in the second call of this function, we provide the first parameter x but we have not provided the second parameter, which means that though the function actually had two parameters we are calling it with one parameter
if i have protected public, i will have protected
so very clearly it is inductive in nature
so look at g one, c, wherever it changes to one, it is here and here, right, these two faults
if i did not have e of t in this integral if i just had epsilon r of tau d tau which is known as a function of time then i can perhaps evaluate it
so i have to make the air gap as small as possible so that the magnetizing current drawn in the case of an induction machine becomes really really small as small as possible
x is going to be a column vector of phi 1 phi 2 all the way up to phi n
so, this gives me the overall torque expression, from which we talked about 2 different situations one was when s is very much less than 1 or closed to 0 right, which is the normal operating situation of an induction motor, normally, if you look at most of the induction motors, we are going to have the rotor copper loss to be generally very very small as compare to what is coming into the rotor
52 kilo watt right
similarly, if prism is prism axis is perpendicular to vertical plane and resting on one of the edge and when we are looking at that this entire face is parallel to horizontal plane
for example, if you if you just instead of this directions suppose current direction is like this so; that means, what it is this is the current the current leaving the dot right and it is entering the dot it will be minus right you have see
so, in that case first you see the problem it is actually what is given that your you have to this is one your what you call this is coil is own on this on this part of this material right and number of turns n 1 is 500 and here also n 2 is n 2 is equal to 1000 turns right
but i agree with you that it may lead to increase in preparation time
i hadve to observe the output from here, right i hadve to apply the bias voltage across the across the operation amplifier alright
you are holding your breath
so, that means, wthat i have to use the function called trans equipment called ora device called a transformer, transformer
where the fuel that is going to use in clinkerization is coming from
3 means 1 million, 350,000 dollars
so that will try to push the machine back to synchronous speed that is what is going to happen
now jean piaget said that basically it is an adaptive process that involves interplay of biological maturation and the interaction with the environment
that loan available with us is you can use say this is the total amount is that is the excess of the deficit of the cash is $63,470
so, line to neutral you made then multiplying by root 2; that means, the peak value
now if my object is very small considering the smallest possibility one pixel white right
so let us take this e zero field, and what we expect this e zero would do is that produce a polarization p
the s parameter matrix of this wilkinson power divider can be given by this equation
now, have we already considered long term provisions
5 i think these days
i will that what the image charge should be, alright, behind the dialectic as an assignment problem and send it over the assignment
this creates a mental image which in turn will help you recollect the number very fast okay, so this is called number peg technique and with this we have come to an end to our discussion on the topic memory, just to summarize we talked about the three structures of memory, the sensory, short term and long term memory okay, and in long term of course we devoted to much of time to understand different, different formats of a long term storage okay, semantic memory, we talked about episodic memory okay
so, the next think that i have to do is find out so, look back over here at the steps i had do i have my j now; i mean i had my j, i had my g, i calculated a
we have to make sure that eventually we will reach this point
you get my point, if it is a cylinder if i cut it and spread it, it will look like a rectangle if this portion is a and this portion is b so this is essentially a and this is essentially b and when i fold it, it can become like a cylinder
or other way we can write if you take the v as the reference, let me clear it, otherwise your this is my v and this is my i, right
if this is zero, also g will become zero and of course, g stuck at zero
and we are done this to avoid, what
so, because of this the number of equations would be reduced and it is much easier to solve this kind of circuit
so that is not what you want
so, ice crystal right
both are, they are rotating at the same direction at the same velocity whether the north and south
however, you will not have the frog which is the depression that is typically present on the top surface which helps in creating an interlocking layer along with the motor construction
these things are described in more detail in basic electrical circuits or you can use some of the textbooks that you may have which describe the op amp
so, for the financial budget you have to prepare two statements
so what i mean is that this plus means a horizontal cut and the star means a vertical cut
i am looking at a magnetic field which is revolving, so i am looking at an equivalent ac current that would have produced the same strength of magnetic field as i have produced now with the dc current which i am rotating at synchronous speed, right
256 and initial energy stored was 0
i am going to have probably the north pole here and south pole here and so on that is it, that is what i am going to get
the same thing as i have illustrated
so it will be this probability were actually go down
with that visual we can easily recognize how this pyramid is inclined
so, the idea is until and unless you short both the things or you place something on the inter digitated electrodes you will see infinite impedance
so, what are those characteristics like i said if you take a ideal operational amplifier, then you have infinite of voltage gain we will see, but practical operation amplifier it would be somewhere around this value, in input impedance is infinite
suppose i have, i have, a buffer which is directly driving, let say, hundred clock loads
so, by constructing by using these two shape functions as your basis functions what you are allowing
38 so roughly it will give 8
so, let me clear it; that means, whatever current is flowing your this i 2 current is flowing here right 2 20 and 30 both are in series and i 1 minus i 2 also flowing through 50; that means, i 1 minus i 2 is equal to i 2
so, more assets are getting locked up, relatively giving lesser profitability
this is the poisson's equation
25 d so this will become 410 kilonewton meter so maximum bending moment we can find out as this okay so once we get maximum bending moment we can find out moment due to impact also impact so due to impact additional 25 percent load will come into picture so 25 percent of this maximum bending moment that is coming 102
so, i am going to show this as i0 and this has w0 and of course the voltage applied here is rated voltage
so, that is the problem with mri
and it gives us the functions that are used to implement the actual public interface
our goal is to find some inductive structure which makes this thing computationally more efficient
so, audit committee, though is a part of board, is supposed to overlook the functioning of the board to whom the auditors make interim reporting
now the question is yes indeed what here when i am drawing that yes from the pre existing cell, i am getting another cell sure, sorry, i mean out here; out here, yeah definitely, from cell this green one, this is the new cell
so you get gamma is equal to gamma is equal to two
you will get this eb value to be very clearly greater than 230 because it is vt plus ia re right
now why do we have to go to all these lengths
now, guilds and trade organizations in the earliest times identified goods by marks as a means of liability
so, what you can say is that in this part of the curve the diode voltage does not change much
let's try to find out
and if it gets killed then you cannot file a patent for your invention
so, it is this is what i want to do; now i am looking at electric fields on the grid ok; so space derivatives
it should lead you to a point where if there is a similar situation that you are experiencing for the second time or for n number of times you just extend your previous experience and based on the similarity between the two situations you decide last time this was the appropriate response therefore, this time also this is the appropriate response
so, what we can do is first and because of that some constant equation will come
we will select all of these
so, actually it would be tempting to set p equal to minus 1, but remember epsilon r and mu r need not be constants
so, it is very good we have a reference solution
so he is connecting to the output of the differential amplifier
selection of suitable product mix
so the point is, we know that there are advantages in terms of reducing co2 footprint, right, less limestone is needed to make this cement, kiln temperature is two hundred degrees celsius lower than what you use for portland cement, the grinding energy is low
now, if i considered this particular function you can see two things; one is it has a large number of parameters, 11 parameters and to be able to use this you will typically need to know what these 11 parameters mean and you will need to specify those parameters
but then if you go deep down you realize that these two tools might not be appropriate for handling every question that you are interested in
and this is a tank which has to be replenished time to time with the with nitrogen as your every time you are opening it
and same thing is asking for mesh analysis right, both you will do
so, there are two drops clearly, voltage drops, we are considering mainly the series portion because that is where the voltage is dropped, right
so, this particular traverse heat function takes a memory location
now, let me take a 3rd coil ok
so, and many of us many teachers do it, but what is important is that we should require learners not only to make the prediction, but also to articulate the reasons as to how they arrived at the prediction so this is an example of articulation
that electromagnetic field carries momentum, and i am going to now demonstrated this formula through an example
so, this current we are taking i what you call that your short circuit current; that means, here no current here 5 5 ohm this thing resistance actually it will ineffective the because this is shorted
1 and the poisons ratio of motor would be about 0
so, what we are trying to do in the second case, that is the diverter case is to divert some portion of the current away from the field coil, so that again we are reducing the m m f
so, as i said, we can use the fault simulation tool for various purposes
similarly you can say that if you connect the ac voltage source then how power would be dissipated by that particular element and when we equate the power for dc and ac we get the value of effective voltage
as a make driver
the most common dopants are boron and phosphorus to create your n channel and p channel for your mosfets
the first step is you always have to save it
5 right, this one is 0
so, direction of this current that what you call is ah through i 4 ohm resistance it is given this way right
now, suppose i want to have a bounded set
and this capacitor is connected this 20 ohm resistance is connected ah across the capacitor right
and remember that these are simple scheduler, these are not preemptive, only the start execution of a program in each frame and it is not that some high priority task can arise and then we have to pre empt some tasks etc nothing
so, in any case the voltage induced on the line propagates along the line as a traveling wave
now, what is the problem with this equation
i think identification of the right problem is the key for the entire process what we will be going through
you have silicon mu e, which is the mobility of the electron in the conduction band is around 1350 centimeters square volts per second
5 millimeters, 0
now, transfer function method is valid only for linear time invariant systems whereas state equations can be applied to linear as well as nonlinear system
we have to draw a line from point q', so we have located q' point and a 120 degrees line we will draw it in that way, and this meets horizontal line at 50 mm above xy
so it means these two stories tell us that yes, we can go for it and we can say win over the hearts of the people, we can change the dynamics of the market, we can say earn a significant market share within no time provided in a price sensitive economy we are able to keep the cost of production under control and with the help of standard costing we are going to do that or we normally do that in the businesses
so, these are the certain relationship you have to keep it in your mind
so definitely we are essentially retaining so advantage if i try to write it
in liability side the first item written is authorize share capital although keep in mind that this is not to be taken in the total
there is a channel here horizontal orientation
so, then she will come back after putting encapsulating them into namespaces
we are in module number 4 and lecture number 37
once you calculate all the matrix i mean the integral i a i b is equal to h and 0, this is after the mom procedure has been carried out
so basically you are saying that you used to read
now, this is a similar gesture to the one i have just shown, but here the hand is nearer to the mouth and the thumb is supporting the chin, which means that the person has negative thoughts about what you are saying
it means that you can represent this circuit as t equivalent
and what will be your ah voltage magnitude
so, now, let us try a little bit more of algebra to see how we can simplify things further
so, i could solve the whole problem with n 1 or i could solve it with n convention depends on me ok, i am going to choose n
only experts are involved in calculating the standard cost
so, the main reason for this plus 1 here is to avoid having to write minus 1
so the first factor that affects the skew is the electrical symmetry of the network
and f first are r you had to calculate for the low pass filter, the feedback it registersresistors and capacitor isare there thatwhich you had to calculate
that means that it is not necessary that it will create a close loop, so it can have the close loops but there may be some open loops also
so, recollect that in the previous lecture when we looked at the buffer overflow and how the attacker wrote his payload in the stack and then executed that particular payload is that the attacker was able to inject code by writing to the stack and then execute in the stack
in that i would like for the entire team anybody can pitch in is have you actually seen
so, in this case, so it is line current magnitude is equal to your write as a phase current here
so, m20 grade of concrete and as far as the steel is concerned, you have to have a minimum cover of 15 m m at the top and bottom and 20 millimeters cover on the sides
if things are equi spaced we go with eqsp equi space kind of things
so this module is going to be about the method of moments which is the name given to the way in which we solve the integral equations
i see that i am going to get an mmf wave which will keep on rotating at the same speed as that of the oscillatory speed of the sinusoidal wave which is the current wave
characteristic equation of the system is defined as the left side portion
so, we have seen in this particular module high pass filters, we have seen the main difference between high pass and low pass filters is that in the high pass filter the capacitor is at the starting and the resistor is next; in the low pass filter we feed the value to resistor and then to capacitor
so, this is the question and let us find out the answer ok
and operating budget is we prepare the, we start with the sales budget and to achieve that level of sales, how much production is required and how to attain that given level of the production
then how do we assess the learners for tasks at different levels
here, you can see the mask thickness and can grow the silicon dioxide for diffusion
reinforced brickwork for beams and reinforced brickwork for slabs was something that was in use in the early 1900s in this country in the indian subcontinent and gained prominence primarily after poor performance of masonry buildings in some devastating earthquakes across the subcontinent
whatever the thing we have constructed here is that making sense is that making sense from this top view
so, there should be in a here, this cancels and we are left with partial v x by partial x a b c
so similarly, if there is a winding coming along here you can see this is also coming along the cusp almost at the end it is being inserted
so, y is never smaller than x, and z is never smaller than y
g 1 right, k square term goes away, and now i am left with the right hand side
we have to first try to convert delta into star
now, if buffer
for example, if you try to say okay, am, i would like to change the reference by putting c to b, but then b is a
in dyadic situations particularly the evidence of eye contact passes on negative connotations
now let's see in an example problem whether you can identify the direct inversions that can occur for a task and what's the duration of that inversion
another example of an educational game is situational games, where learners have to solve a relevant problem by interacting with various characters or various parts of the game and simulate real world scenarios and see the results
there are various ways of doing it
for that purpose you click your scroll button, click and move the mouse in different directions ok
in fact, it should be less than 2 db
please recall your c
so, now, we have to prove this value of i again would be 1
this inclined to vertical plane we can see only in the top view
remember if i had a metallic slab on the left, there will be no field inside
now, in this context, we can see that the actual object that is created has a type which is of b; this has a type which is of b
similarly if i have r x much less than r v then choose this circuit this means a once again this circuit
however, we have seen the del square, phi zero, so this terms drops out
if i am talking about the flat or level compounded motor, it is a differentially compounded dc motor, right
so, how does a inductor and capacitor help us and how does the use of inductor and capacitor, along with the op amp will hhelp us to form a lc oscillatorss
so, 5 kva
30 days credit period we are giving but 60% of sales are collectible at the end of the current month 60% 30% of the sales will be collected by the end of next month and only 10% will go to the next to next month collection
all of them are going to have almost similar characteristic because i am assuming that i am not including any extra resistance in the field circuit that is what i am assuming
it is if you see the mesh analysis technique it is merely an extension of kirchhoff's law
right, now, in case of mild steel an ideal curve is looks like this, right
first
it is supposed to be perpendicular to horizontal plane, but inclined to vertical plane that means, perpendicular, it can be a plane in that direction
but then the problem as we shall see when we derive the expression for this gt it contains some terms which make the design of a network with pure gt difficult and therefore we will actually design with gt in mind but with some simplifications we shall see this later
in the case of acceptors, the fermi level moves closer to the valence band
design collaborative group activities for learners and ask them to conduct peer review by providing them descriptive rubrics
so let me start with actually the recalling of single phase ac circuits
our hy was 4550 kiloons whereas ha plus hb is almost 500 kiloons so that so the extra 50 kiloons is because of the additional effects that you have that is because of the eccentricity and the accidental eccentricity which is also built in from the design perspective
next will take the numerical; numericals are easy only thing is calculations should be correct for example
one note is also given that bad debts recovered is not included in cash balance
if you look back here this total field formulation all of this is happened this all of this happened on gamma itself outermost boundary right
even if you have these functions you do not always want to give these functions individually, because there might be some constraints between the values which have to be preserved and you can preserve those by controlling access to them
so, there are 2 types of sources independent and dependent sources
but what are the limitations of cv cv analysis so there are many limitations of the cv analysis number one is valuation problems i have already told you in the last class that there are different types of cost and benefits so the particular categories of cost and benefits also intangible cost and benefits that very much difficult to identify measure and quantify they cannot be quantified easily that is one of the most difficult problem in the most difficult challenge in case of cost benefit analysis that is intangible cost and the intangible benefits they are difficult to identify may be difficult to what measure and quantify another problem is known that the distortion problems there are two ways of distorting the results of cb analysis one there may be international favoritism of an alternative for the political reasons and two when the data are incomplete or they are missing from the analysis is very difficult to take an appropriate action and the next problem is a completeness problem here the cost related to cb analysis may be on the high side
so, for designing the same circuit on the mmulti samesim, we will do the same thing and we will ask sitaram to join us
the first one we look at is the deadline monotonic algorithm, just a small variation of the rate monotonic algorithm and this we need to use when the task deadline and periods are different
then gamma l will be given like this okay
so, they are different and therefore, the radar cross section is going to be different
further, it is a cost that management believes should be incurred to produce a good or service under anticipatory conditions
but then the worst case memory access time degrades because if the page is not available in memory, a page fault occurs and then it has to be obtained from the hard disk and the page faults incur significant latency
so, there is some idea that the wave is somehow bending around obstacles and we are able to receive it this is in day to day life
0 to 28
so, then in that case the thread length 18 mm also has to be shown this is the 18 mm
so here you are saying is that the process is essentially one of dividing a polynomial by another polynomial, and take the reminder that that will be the cyclic redundancy code and in in this case, our signature
warehouse, as i told you store and warehouse
the period is equal to deadline
old mark is a certification mark
i can operate it here i can operate it here i can operate it here
so, weight residue integrate ok
similarly, for point c below hp in front of vp both the points on one side, but that is below xy line, check your solution with the actual solution ok
if we relate this to i am pure depression you see endogenous depression rest all are mixed with the anxiety if you look at it, but we do not put a diagnosis of mixed anxiety depression on everybody
they buy clinker from some other plant and then they transport the clinker and they grind it near a city which does not have a cement plant or integrated cement plant nearby
it can also involve home security like access control and alarm system as well
in case of bolt in exerted in tension, we can calculate the tensile strength of the bolt as tnf, as this: 09 fub into anb and it has to be less than fyb
you will see there are several techniques to deposit a metal film or a semiconductor film or insulating film
443 and greater than 0
we can use same kind of thing by using drawing lines, then drawing arcs, again drawing a line and closing it by arc also, semi circle, we can do that
if the diaphragm, horizontal deformation, the diaphragm's deformation limits are within, are acceptable, then that shear force is really the capacity, global capacity of the structure
now the details we can take either the surface integral or the volume integral approach it does not matter ok
the monitor mode which saves the context of the current executing environment and then decide whether that interrupt can be should be serviced by a normal world application or a secure world application
can you think of it
in my system it printed this, but it will certainly print some garbage
so, this is sort to the sum it up this is your basic setup of finite of element method is that; first of all the basis functions are sub domain that is a key point next your operator is a differential operator therefore, there is no green’s function involved in its solution
so they keep on maintaining the credit sales ledger and reminding the company and helping them that to make the payment as and when it is due
almost all of you would have your own bank account
what kind of magnitude of energy are we talking about
so, i 2 is given also 10 ampere right
in this case, this is another interesting case of the position of the smith chart and stability circle
because, your it is unity power factor load, so root 3 v l, we know that general root 3 v l, the current we have taken i l dash
yeah some will be some will guide it some will get will leak out ok
now angular frequency that is omega you will get equal to 50 radiance per second
in the second part, where you have a design to be implemented, you actually complete the interconnections to create your designs, right
so, whatever device you are going to connect; so, we can design a suitable connector and do the connections there then the signal levels will be compatible
second one because
the output, it is taken between source and ground
so, this ammeter you have to keep an eagle eye on that continuously
it is not never be horizontal right because of it is weights and wind's pressure
ttill then you take care
so, k omega mu what else
so, we can say that the 0th value in point is the x coordinate
what are the possibilities
the actual parameters and the formal parameters must match in their order, in their data type and so on
so, this is the curve o g b right, this is the middle line right, this middle your curve right o g b right, suppose it has reach up to h
so, the sum total of the capacity which helps you to act purposefully now which act is purposeful and which act is meaningless, could be a matter of debate if you look at it in philosophical term, but if you look at it in pragmatic terms say purposeful act where you have a goal driven behavior and your capacity helps you attend that very goal
we will close this
what was the profit here
we have seen this with couple of examples and we have also seen the construction and destruction based object lifetime for automatic, static and dynamically allocated objects
so the moment by the bolt in tension can be found in terms of its uhh external moment, that is m dash is equal to m by certain factor, right
so, what we will do is we will we will take consider 2 steps which will help us to accomplish this thing ok
so we are talking in this class about sulphate attack of concrete
but, for ac circuit ah, we will solve very little because, complex number will be involved, right
downwards, which way is the third direction is phi, is into the board or out to the board
and i have put the e to the j omega t that is the phasor and i this is; obviously, going to be a complex quantity and since i want to only deal with real valued quantities in the lab world so i related by taking the real part so, that is what we will do
formula is similar to your low pass filter that is fc equals to one upon 2 pi rc ,same formula, we have used for the low pass filter as well
at the same time national tastes are also reflected in those food items which are popularly consumed
if you prepare these sub budgets and then you sum it up then finally we will be able to find out the budgeted profit and loss account and the budgeted balance sheet right so now cash collection budget we will write to again here particulars then we write here the months here so when we are talking about the months again we have the three months how much we are going to collect in june how much we are going to collect in july how much we are going to collect in july, how much we are going to collect in august
it is a tri band gsm, gprs engine that works on these three frequencies, that is 900 megahertz, 1800 megahertz, and 1900 megahertz
so, this is our second criterion where we expect the level of average, the level of pre compression in the wall or the average normal stress in the wall to be of intermediate range
now, this is my device, this is my mobile device, which i will be scanning first
then there should as well as be the electronic current that flows between the power supply and the wires, you need an ionic current to flow between the two electrodes
so, you will bypass this construction process, and you will always return the printer that you have constructed first
and what is the value of this constant
so, this clearly show that between the two parameters b and c, c is following the original call by value rule by which is just the value of a which is copied to c
certainly you will have to be careful about the requirements for example, we just saw that if we are doing an input streaming operator then we need to pass the parameter the data value as a reference which is non constant because we expect that the input streaming we will actually put value into that, but otherwise first attempt would be to try to honor the parameter passing convention
could be z directed, but it is not a was
at the same time researchers in this area tell us that both these interpretations are equally applicable and available
i want to acknowledge professor h c verma at i i t kanpur, who has developed these demonstrations for school going kids
then e cross b is has the same direction as direction of propagation
that as soon as a task acquires the resource, its priority, becomes equal to the ceiling value associated with the resource
so, let me call this as w1 and w2
the north west to south east diagonal is the one where the difference is the same and if you look at the differences, if you go back then you see the differences at this diagonal here, the difference is 7 minus 0 is 7 and here the difference is 0 minus 7 is minus 7
let us now talk about how many types of emotions are their okay if i ask you how many emotions are there i am sure you will come across with an erosive list of emotions psychologists have tried to no find out how many basic emotions are there basic emotion would mean that these set of emotions will have very distinct features their characteristics will not overlap with other emotions okay, so if the characteristics of happiness does not overlap with the characteristics of sadness then happiness and sadness qualifies to be two distinct basic emotions okay
so, the reversed direction is going to be this right
now let's see why there must be at least one full frame between the arrival of a task instance that is a job and its deadline
so, whatever infrastructure you have is known as fixed asset
because, it becoming this your what you call it is becoming your what you call less than 1 percent of the peak value right
so put is: replace one by jj and replace two by m two
now, the advantage of assert is certainly if you put to many of them in the program then at the run time there will be lot of places where your checks will keep on happening and that will become a detrimental to the performance of the program
this principle says that to effectively convey e learning content, we should use both words as well as graphics
t then i have i have r h equals to 2 kilo ohms r h equals to 2 kilo ohms
so moment is n into e is something that you need to bring in
this is a starting and a simple problem and it will give you proper insights into cash flow statement
so, this golden rules tends to when you have negative feedback, when you have negative feedback
the lower levels of memory either the dram or lower levels of the cache like the l2 or the l3 cache would require to service that particular load request
in the indirect stroke, induced voltage can take place on the lines as a result of close by lightning stroke to ground
so, where this is the small resistance inside, from this here you connect 1 terminal here you connect another terminal another lid and this is soldered inside
so what has happened internally is that rather since this was the first malloc that is invoked in this particular program the ptmalloc code which has got linked with this particular program through libc has invoked the operating system and it has requested for a large chunk of memory of 132 kilobytes
the accelerometer that we will be using in this experiment is adxl 335, where you can see that these are the pins of this accelerometer
so, in terms of u what will i write this as
so, i am not marking again that in by color ah your ink, but this is your node a from the circuit
now in the screw mate dialog box we will see we have to select this axis of the bolt and also the axis of this nut to be aligned
so now, how you will describe the terminal currents and voltages
remember the kind of equations that i get there will be sparse
now, what is voltage v
so, that is a button for ref, all right
and especially if you are going to any workshops machine shops still autocad is quite popular, because you want to send your information in a very effective way autocad really gives you that kind of advantage
our income is not unlimited that we are only looking for the quality irrespective of any price
now, up to this your ohm’s law and this thing let us come now to a small example, right
several researches have also been conducted and you can also conduct this is small experiment take a friend pupil size when you are talking to him or her about something interesting and then change to all subject which is repulsive to them and then you can find the pupil suddenly contract
next we will look into how we can connect this accelerometer with stm board
right so, there we will have to take our s not in the xy plane, but will have to take it in let say the your zx plane or zy plane or something like that right
after she watched the video one of her friends asked her to summarize the key points of the water cycle which was presented in the video and it turned out that ulfa could not articulate she could not summarize the key points
so if you look at the permissible compressive force you have two parts of this expression
this hold time is the time you must keep the input data stable before the clock comes
another example which has been cited by her is related with the branding by kokoro and moi to promote their street food festival in helsinki
therefore, we can write t 1 by to t 2 is equal to n 1 by n 2 whole cube right that is x cube, so t 1 by t 2 is equal to x cube
so, when you are making the calculations for each component or each, when you are talking of component it is one wall with several peers or the wall together, several walls together in the seismic load path itself
actually we have, means incur the less cost so our profit is increased
and finally, the last current asset is cash
you say customers right also to buy the best product
so these three we discussed in the last class
so, we have taken this total
you need to have some devices that will track the location and will also receive some data, if it is required some sensor data can be uploaded
and if i have vo and v o will be nothing but 1 plus rf by rin into vin right
so, this is a separate mesh it is a separate mesh because this is open so, no current is flowing here, because it is a say it is a its a this is open this is open right; so, let me clear it
so sigma one theta is going to be p, which is p z times normal, which is pointing in the minus r direction
tthen we have similarly for channel 2, but right now channel 2 has no signal
dot d s, and this i can rewrite, using stokes theorem, as equal to one half i integral a dot d l
so, you call these also r 4 this is how it looks like the instrumentation amplifier
at the end you will be getting these partitions which can be directly placed, placed on the silicon floor
so, other equity the note is given which mainly consists of reserves and surplus
so, will be the here only right so, if k less than that is step up transformer if k greater than that is step down transformer
so, we will work through how do we you know setup the equations, convert it into something called a weak form, which is very characteristic to fem, i will tell you what that is and then how do we solve it ok
this already gives us enough information to write our first python program
so, as you can see, this straight line behavior is still being maintained, right
so, there might be life challenges when these basic components that you have defined and you so strongly hook to, it also gets challenge
now, filters as you know, they are selective in which frequencies they allow to pass through them
so this is for a shorted line
so, this is one relation, you can also derive it by finding the current and then adding the voltage drop here, the way we did it in the last class here we did that ok
so, and after that we will calculate three more variances as the sub variances of the labor efficiency variance which is labor ide time variance, labor mix variance and labor yield variance
now, we would like to have it in top view how to construct that
it has its own techniques
so, 2 popular designs for these bends are common, one is what is known as the radial implementation
there are different power measurement methods, it can be with single watt meter but this can work only when neutral is available, most of the times neutral may not be available so we may not be using it
what is the input voltage
so, this is the weight of the ice then, but total ice, the total weight will be, this is the weight of the ice and weight of the conductor is also there, then you have to consider both
i am again trying to do p pointer f look at statically these are the same expression, but if we do it with the base class object, it invokes the base class function; if i do it with a derived class object, it invokes a derived class function
this particular craft shows the response for 128 bits
right, that is what i was thinking
it is the case where i do not know the analytical integral of an equation ok, that is the first thing
so, today we have discussed the difference between micro and macro facial expressions and what exactly is the significance of understanding micro expressions in our interpersonal behavior
so, it is basically a ramp function and your another thing is that is a gate function right
but even if i do not write the virtual keyword in front of this inherited function, which i am overriding, while that inherited function was virtual in the base class that it will continue to be virtual in the derived class as well
now there is a temporal delay between the stimulus in the response
so, i can say even if ia is kept at rated value, because flux decreases i am going to have reduction in te
and i quote from there is search they say that, in genuine smiles, which have been termed as duchenne smiles in honour of the work of the great french anatomist, muscles lift the cheek up wards and push the skin towards the eyes, narrowing the eyes and causing crow’s feet wrinkles at the outer corners of the eyes
so, by using this non inverting and inverting impressionoperational amplifier, your formula for gain would be slightly different
so, these cardiac myocytes what you have isolated are coming from a not i mean it comes from we more than several surrounding cell
so, how one can do it
suppose i have a graph
they are removed so that we know the profit available for the equity owners and we will divide it by number of shares
so, it is some total source long term loans to be borrowed from the market and then some funds will be available in the form of the, say, current liabilities or spontaneous finance
how we can calculate, right how you can calculate
so he has not understood his topic completely
originally, it was x 1 now it is x 2, so it has moved slightly towards whatever is actually my c shaped frame c shaped magnet
so, that projection what we will see it with respect to xy and this plane can be here it can be there also
this branch current say i 2 is equal to say i d 2 plus j i q 2 if it is lagging i q 2 will be negative does not matter and this branch say current is i d 3 plus j i q 3 right and this branch say branch 4 i d 4 plus j i q 4 and this branch say it is i d 5 plus j i q 5 these are in terms of real and imaginary and this capacitor current is i c
this in between the two region which i am showing through the greeni do not know the nature of field, all rights
now, if you apply kcl in this circuit what you can do
so what is the profit
so i have to calculate and then i have to find out which one will be the most critical one
i am not going to get into the details of how the harmonics are eliminated
later we will use the old second balance across this inductor to find out the input outher relationship
so, the first thing he has tried 20 kilo ok, let us see now
that is not the case ok,, because current changes depending on the load that you are using it, what you connect it
now we all can play badminton, but we cannot play now to the level to which you saw p v sindhu playing or other sports man similarly you can play flute you can play guitar, you can sing the song, but not as melodious as some of the established singers you can play a music instrument, but not as well as some of the celebrated musicians
then you you can apply plus 15 minus 15 right thatwhich is the another advantage
you are the new manager of the company's store in the mall of america
so, i have just put directly that 40 and 50 are in parallel with that 20 is in series and along with that 30 ohm again in parallel
and these were the items which technically if you plot historically on the time line you would realize that they involved at the time when clinical diagnosis was extremely important
but the trouble is that, as i said, the entire process consists of manipulation of expressions, which is a little difficult to do in an automated way by using a tool or a program
we talked about one iterative method in the previous lecture and today we look at the second iterative method and the next assignment which is going to be dealing with pm design would then take you through the specifics of how you would arrive at in which region of the interaction is the design situated and how do you check how much of steel is sufficient for that combination
so, this person may come back at you and say your cem is useless right and will almost be correct except that, as i am the point i am trying to make here is that the choice of mom makes a huge difference right
in this module we are going to cover just the basic introduction of certain microwave components
so, unlike 3 different types of devices for 3 port devices like circulators, or tees or power dividers, all 4 port microwave devices are known by the general term couplers
secondly, we are considering all paths to be equal
therefore, these three letters must be the same
we can substitute these values for no, npo and nno
one is tat, that is total asset turnover ratio
now, i am going to connect the load this may be a variable load but let us say i am actually connecting it corresponding to a current that will be drawn which is ilrated
so, there is a huge jump now both in terms of pieces of information and also in terms of the temporal duration of the stay of information
so, further we need to divide by 1,000 to get the correct figure
suppose it was operating that apart this is for a, this is another unit for b, this is another for c something like this right
some terms may not be there like x y term may not be there and so on ok
we shall also be looking at some [vocalized noise] architecture, then higher level techniques which we can use
we shall be looking at two different techniques or approaches fault equivalence and fault dominance
now, since the inductor and capacitor are in series the inductor current is the same as the capacitor current, so what we can say
so, here the magnitude would be like this, but, since it is in the opposite direction it will become negative
the other mate available in the advanced mate is path mate
yyou want to find q, again very easy right; f by f c by bandwidth
so, this is q, this is input
so, this is the meter with fsd, 10 milli ampere meter resistance 100 ohm and we will connect some resistance to get the desired range ok
so, your j, let us just take it as a function of time right, we will have some fourier transform right
if we can anticipate an error we would prefer to think of it not as an error, but as an exception
so, rather than now drawing the flux versus field current if i try to completely draw what is eg versus field current,right
so, suppose you have a distribution network look you just try to understand first that it will be application of capacitor to distribution system, this will be the headline that application of capacitor to distribution system i will come to that all this thing later, but before that certain things you have to understand
so it is, again you know, for going to have any chance of meeting these challenges facing us, we have to educate our civil engineers differently so that they understand this
so, in this case your, so initially that is why i told you that v c your and initially we will assume that initial voltage of the capacitor was v c 0 is equal to v 0 that we are assuming it, it may be 0 also, but we are assuming that v c 0 is equal to v 0 right and at steady state i told you, v c infinity is equal to i r
so, this is actually what you call
for a car dealer, car is a stock item
if curl of b is not zero, that means there will be some magnetic field even between the plates, although normally you would not expect it
so, let us say that this is my x 1 e over here this is my x 2 e over here
so, in this case if it issuppose 110, 220 volt
now, in this case tau is equal to leq upon r
so, let us start with introduction
and this is 10, so and this is the angle is more than 90
ah step of routing, you may find that some of the nets your unable to rout because you do not have adequate space to draw the lines
2 angle 156
silicon is 1350 for the electrons and 450 for the holes and gallium arsenide has a very high mobility for electrons, it is around 8500, holes is around 400
so i apply zero zero to s zero and s one
and how culture fair are these tests, culture fair means if the test was developed validated in say a western culture how much is it a possibility that i can used the same test using the same norm in my cultural context
for example, the shape and the texture of the object on which the color is seen, the placing of this object in a particular environment etcetera also provide additional interpretations of a particular color
those are the basic type traits that both the function template as well as the class template will need to follow
so, we are saying that suppose this current is i
so, r norton is nothing, but r thevenin same thing the way you get thevenin same way you got r norton it is same thing right
we are going to do what is called galerkin’s method, where the basis functions and the testing function are the same right ok
so, let us say that we have a small part of the cipher which looks something like this, we have a plain text p 0 and a plain text p 4 which is the input to the cipher
we can write the value of i 1 is nothing but v 1 minus v a by 10 and the current is going inside, so we are taking current going inside as positive or current going outside as negative so the current going in the 20 ohms resistance will be minus of v a by 20 plus the current i 2 is equal to 0
i would, say, start with, are they happy
analog multiplexer is similar, the difference is that the inputs are analog voltages; one of the input will be selected at the output depending on what you are applying at the digital select input lines
then i add a shorted stub of length theta length and i get y in equal to 1
see, the fixed overhead cost is the relationship is inverse
the marking is indicated by a red mark
variable cell placement, fpga, gate array is you do not any choice
so, if you change v 1; that means, v d 1 or v 2; that means, v d 2, if you change either of these two inputs how will these two graphs will change ok
so, i will write it here, what we have done
so, if all of it means that your x l minus x c it will be resonance condition right therefore, the primary effect of the series capacitor is to minimise or even suppress the voltage drop caused by the inductive reactance in the circuit
so, the boundary conditions are satisfied right what was their earlier is there now
exactly i will get a root 3
the 12th division the most commonly known division the clinical psychology division basically it handles the science of clinical psychology it also focuses on the assessment of the individual clinical zero psychology and is another, specific concerned at this group focuses on women and ethnic minorities are of course, other special groups
so, in this case you are there no torque developed and the rotor continues to be stationary
so, let me write vector from 1 2 as r 1 2, vector from 2 to 1 as r 2 1, i follow this convention all throughout
so, it turns out there are very very few problems in electromagnetic where there is a known analytical solution and one is this fresnel reflection coefficient, the others are scattering from infinite cylinder and a perfect sphere these are called mie series solutions cylinder and sphere
so, which looks easier to you solving for rho or solving for a
so, this i a minus i b is equal to v p angle 0 because, v ab v p angle 0 right zy is equal to v l angle 0 by your z y right
so if i say that i have a typedef and i say void star p f, then p f becomes f type of a function pointer
now, these clamping forces, depending on how much the wall is deflecting, starts increasing
5 or 50 percent, if you have 2 photons coming in only 1 of them will get converted to an electron hole pair
this mainly caters to those who are interested in the study of accounting but tries to consider those students who may not have a commerce or accounting background but today are interested in accounting education
so this is a process which is typically done before you actually do testing of the circuit or test generation or whatever right fine, there is another method using which also we can reduce the number of faults
so, it is minus j by 4 times the hankel function right
then what should happen
so far we have seen some basic types of values in python
so, now we will have hands on experience for this orthographic projections
now, let us look into the output
so i want to get what is the inductance corresponding to these portions of the magnetization characteristics
now, after we have labeled it, phase two consists of the retrace phase
why because they going to apply
csa cement have lower ph than opc, but you can see that, at least in the study they reported around twelve point six to seven ph, right
why are we taking different conventions for global and local you can use same
so, when i go to use the equation i am using an older outdated version of e z i in order to prevent that i shall quickly do the update before the wave actually reaches this
but instead of doing this which we will see how to do later on when we actually get into formal python, let us explore a new way of going through a list of values
so, for an ideal op amp, what is the modification i have to do
so the force of attraction between these two blocks, b one and b four, will be w one four multiplied by d one four, just exactly like hookes law, whatever it says, it will be proportional to the distance
take some time to construct these views, think about it
so, these are the first thirteen letters of the alphabet and we treat the dictionary order of words as the ordering of numbers, we think of them as digits if you want to think of it is base thirteen
this is the very simple and a very commonly used technique for adjusting the delays in a circuit
so say, for example, you are sending it an angle of, say, theta and it is coming back at an angle of theta prime
based on that information we will blend the functions to describe the interpolations and first we will always construct curves and then we will go with surfaces
so, the values, the do and do not that you have learnt in your rearing practices though family, through society, through various agents, who have served no shipping your behavior
so, in this problem what are we trying to solve for
now, if you go back to the slide what we see that how we can compensate the effect of offset voltage, to do that other way one way to compensate this for the effect due to the offset voltage is by applying small voltage in series by applying small voltages in series with one of the inputs to force the output voltage to become 0 right
if we make any changes in the delays here or here or here, either in the delay of the nets or the vertices, then slack mean will also change
so, total average power will be then p a plus p b plus p c is equal to 3 p p, so it will be 3 v p i p cos theta right
since this is a positive photoresist and my mask is bright field mask what will i have
so, we have seen equal to equal to
1, led 1
so, in this case when we talk about the state diagram let us first see how the integration of operation you will define in the state diagram
if you have the set of alternatives here then you have to now choose that which of the alternative or which of the options is better for us, which we should opt for which should be implemented in the firm in the organization there we need the planning because we are planning to reach up to a level maybe after six months or after one year
it may so happen that lets take hypothetic example that from one point you are drawing a line to a point s one and another line to a point s two
the mask that we have used is bright field mask, only the patterns are dark, and the other field is bright
so i will erase this portion here
so, this becomes really the basis of what we are going to be looking at in design for shear walls
so, omega 0 omega 0 will be cancelled right and finally, it will become l upon r square c the q 0 square will become l upon r square c
the strength we can see up to 160 and 170 megapascal strength depending on what kind of mix it is and you will see the failure pattern of a mix right there, again very high strength mixes fail in this fashion as you would have seen
so, these devices could be made from two semiconductors; they could be made from a semiconductor and a metal or even a semiconductor and insulator and a metal
so, we want to avoid that as much as possible and use what we already know and what we already know is a homogeneous green’s function
so, the first thing that will have to look at or bring in to our assessment is what is called lifecycle assessment
so you need not to go for finding out the value of power p directly using super position theorem but you can use the linear relationship of vi and use super position theorem to solve the circuit
its structures the comment and helps the instructor design plan and resources and instruction strategies to be used
when we discussed interrupts earlier, you recall i told you that any of the digital io lines can be used as an interrupt pin
if rc is 0, ic will be infinity
some typical applications leading to embedded system design could be smart home, object tracking, smart transportation, and of course if you combine many of the aspects of various iots, then it leads to a broader picture we call it smart city, and ultimately to smart world
they should be changeable you should not or write it in a way so that i cannot change the output stream or the input stream
no, so sam cannot be happy like this
the intermediate priority tasks can no longer preempt it and the unbounded priority problem is solved
the sign of friction depends on the direction of motion or the initial direction of the velocity
456 meter square volts per second; and mu h the mobility of the holes is lower, because the whole effective mass is higher than that of the electron
this will turn out to be this is the operating point
based on an analysis of the characteristics of the product, the development team and the characteristics of the customer
if we say this is h or d, we can say d minus 2 into tf plus r1
so, you can visualize that right from a very early stage in our life, iconic memory, vision based memory which basically serves us for a very brief period of time, not more than 2 seconds time time plays an important role
now, application by the signal levels are measured in millivolts this is totally not acceptable this can be compensated
the first event says that one of the input lines of the gate has changed its logic state
now adjacent to line we write the transfer function
so this is how the windings are represented
so, this is the rule and here you see the output depends only on, 1 input because the other input is constant fix
now, for modeling of electrical networks, we use the classical way of writing the equation of electrical network and it was based on the two methods one was loop method and second was nodal approach and these two approach are formulated from the kirchhoff’s law
so, the interrupts can be used by schedulers to obtain context switching, so when at interrupt occurs the scheduler can pick a process and preventing the existing process, thus achieving the fact that one application is not hogging the entire system
if the flux gets decreased, it is like field weakening zone
so, you could at a later point of time read through and actually find what this program is doing
and so now, we have fibonacci of 5 is 3 plus 2 and that is 5, and then now this is a new value, so we enter that
so, we have 1 input which is amplified once and then amplified again
it is always convenient to show it in this 2 dimensional framework instead of showing this 3 d picture
in the same that we can you know draw noise figure circles we can also draw noise measure circles and i donõt want to go too much into these noise measure circles but they are useful sometimes
these are just shown as comments the particular code lines which need the knowledge of the type and this is a stack of integer, so these are the lines which need
in such cases if you just dominate the list of arguments with the semicolon, we will say this is a function header or a function prototype or a function signature
let us start from this point, this peak point as a reference and then we will come back to it and extend it and let us say it is in a steady state which means that there is some charge accumulated in the capacitance
because you want to break down the silica fume agglomerate right silica fume will clump so you put the silica fume in you mix with and make silica fume dispersed then you add the limestone because limestone are next larger size again you see larger, larger, larger
then you add the medium with fgf and there are other components in the handout i will give you
now if an ac generator has p pairs of poles right when you have n pole and s pole, right
if you're looking at the vertical direction of the structure along the height of the structure, the prescriptions on how should the floors be, how should be, how should the beams rest on walls, what sort of anchorage or connections are required to have desirable performance or if you do not have positive connections between the floor slabs and the roof slabs, then what sort of an effect does it have on the lateral stability of the walls is something that is directly considered by the code itself
so, that is why this is after arrival at junction because this v b is there, you know v f plus v b is equal to v
but it tells you is that changing b gives e and the equation is: curl of e is equal to minus d, b by d t
the unit step function multiplied by the exponential means you are getting the time shift
and, then it will be independent of whether our clock is running faster or slower or whether we know the this constant k precisely or not, it will be immaterial how let us see
suppose, whatever i am right now teaching you is a signal right
so, this is light emitting diode, again it has an anode and a cathode
next what do i need
the next example is that at an apply cognitive level and the technique used here is called predict, observe and explain
or for example, take rorschach test or thematic apperception test, what is the basis, the basis is i think it all came from
so, we would say something like in our earlier case p is equal to point say 3 comma 4 and then we will say p dot o distance to get its distance
so, how many variables were there in this equation
so, as you see that this particular lecture is focused on experiments on understanding op amp characteristics
however, say sigma one is such the net charge integrate to zero
now, we all know that there are you know large number of dimensions of human behavior, now how to position yourself in the given life circumstances
so, at that time what will happen that when negative voltage will be induced
because at times it can happen because lot of people who are and there are small things which doctors also should notice is that a person who is taking medicines for blood pressure would this is a common myth that you should take less salt; so, they take less salt
now you check for consistency
so, you are you are getting the animal you have to dissected
this might be the center point, i would like to pick pick center
recall that for a point dipole at r prime to the point dipole at r prime, the electrostatic potential at r, so this vector becomes r minus r
so, again dash dot lines, we show to represents that it is a cylindrical object
for example, this is the area what you are seeing, but what i am trying to do is rotate it
so, these are actually the other alternate functions that we have like providing read bar write bar etcetera or this transmit receive
the recommended textbook for our course is engineering drawing by n
these curves might be parallel, may not be parallel; they might be offset with each other also
so, this is what is called equivalent circuit of a transformer
if you simplify this, if you simplify this then it will be s into delta e is equal to minus k into delta f minus kr into delta e or s delta e plus kr delta e is equal to your minus k into delta f right therefore, you take delta e common
so, this two north pole have a larger distance between them compared to these two north poles, because of this trapezoidal shape of this cylinder; therefore, this north pole will be repelled like this
so, for form factor for your square waveform it is 1 right
so, in other words it is the selection of an insulation structure that will withstand the voltage stresses, to which the system or equipment will be subjected together with the proper surge arrester, actually in this course lightning arrester will not cover, but you have the if you go to any power station or substation you will find lightning arrester is there
so again find out the middle points or the tapping points for these four edges
third, this, this r, has a projection in the x y plane, which is this red thick line which is nothing but r sine of theta
there is some circuitry around the op amp
at that time factoring was not allowed in india at that time say 4 fitting was not allowed in india even the derivative finance was also not exist day but there was over the other things that have the working capital finance not only from the banks may be inter corporate deposits, maybe public deposit part of the long term funds to be the short term requirements that should be done by the industries
one more possible liability is deferred tax liability
in this case, we are given the value of f s and now we need to transform it back to the time domain and obtain the corresponding value of f t
so, then they call only this part as the equivalent circuit, but then the output from this is i 2 prime v 2 prime not i 2 v 2
if the task execution time is 90 milliseconds and the scheduler itself takes 100 milliseconds, then it is not a good idea
we cannot change the basic properties of the operators and there is a fixed list of operators which only can be overloaded there are some operators which cannot be overloaded, some that should not be overloaded, we discus is on depth on module 9, so i will skip that
so, i will see you in the next class, and till then, take care, and let us see what we learn in the next class, alright
so you know how ah manufacture chip can be tested
whereas amqp, ah, it say: ok, i can take message, in sort of allow it to transmit large messages, even on constrained environments
onsite problems
once it is done, divide a to c into equal number of parts, same number of parts like 1, 2, 3 all the way to 9; so 10 equal parts we are going to construct on this side
o, right
there is a version of multiply instruction where the result can be stored in two registers or 64 bits
so, question is that here we have to be current is simple series circuit, because 4 ohm, then 6 ohm, then 40 volt all are ah in series
there is a way this entire surface modelling works in the parametric variation
whereas, the class base two implements or helps in implementing the class derived, this is a basic mechanism that we have
then i can use thermal evaporator, but in the cases where i cannot find a material of a boat which is greater than the material melting point of the metal, then in that case i cannot use thermal evaporator alright easy now to generate an electron beam an electrical current is applied to the filament which is subjected to high electric field if you see this one, if you see this particular diagram we have a filament right which is at high electric field
so, both directions are changing
so, i might want to put the size, when i am making a call or i am answering a call i would like to see the face of the person whom i am calling or who is calling me provided that person is in my address book
the counter will be first 00 then 01 then 10 and then 11
this is neutral connected current flowing through i n right
so, this can be done it has to be solved numerically because it is a transcendental equation right it can be done, but so, i mean i am not showing that the calculation here, it is not very hard to do what happens is that as i have so, i mean one thing is that we know that as delta x and delta t tend to 0, i get the perfect wave behaviour ok
now, we will assume let i is equal to i m sin omega t right that we will assume
so the delay variation should be minimum
213
the shear strength itself, the sheer strength of masonry itself actually follows nothing but the morculum criterion that we've been talking of even earlier
so, naturally generator in terms of generator mva capacity that mva will be released because generator needs less mva as compared to without capacita and capacitor
so, z y that star connected it is so, z star or z y is given 40 plus j 25 is equal to 47
now, e, that is short term loans and advances
so, first part is clear space the e z the part by delta x, then we are saying that in this equation when i want to update h y ok
now, before your how we are getting from here to here and what is the your what is the your that vir relationship, what is equal to i, just we will see everything is given at the bottom, but let us see how we can do it
so, this can be written as in the terms of when you will draw the phasor diagram, v m when you take the rms value v m by root 2, and this one can be taken as theta, angle theta
so, these are the limitations of a patentability search, you would normally advise the client about the patentability search, because of these limitations so that there are no unreasonable expectations from the client
so, basically, it is a v into i because pure resistive circuit
this is the block diagram represent our generator load model; sometimes we call this part we call sometimes power system model also right; so, this part
7 points right
so, we collect that this disassembly is present in libmylib
so this wattmeter i am showing it somewhat like this
but it is a combination of series, parallel and sometimes it is having a different shape
so, here, if you see you have one impedance that is called z11 and in series with you will have one dependent voltage source that is having the value of z12 i2, so what would be the value of v1
the essential part of drawing is pencils and eraser; rarely, we use french curves to connect points; usually, we go with freehand sketches, but required we go with french curves as well
this program we want to subvert the execution so that this address in the heap which corresponds to nowinner is modified to that of winner
so you have to keep in mind that the thevenin’s theorem works well when the circuit is linear
if a candidate is fully prepared and is confident that the answer he or she is providing is correct then automatically there would be a shine and confidence in the eyes
now, charge is flowing from left to right in through this block and that means, also the electrons are flowing from right to left ok
and features managers like i said, those things will be available at the first button here
let us talk about how to connect this circuit in reality in lab ok
what is amplitude suppression
and if you have long buildings, if you have long buildings, of course the end walls which are referred to as the return walls in the orthogonal direction, these need not necessarily provide lateral resistance for the entire length of the long walls
by drawing one more circle, we will be in a position to construct an ellipse
so, this is my q right
so, let us look at step 1 ok
and i am sharing this slides with you
it will now start to decrease ok, because now input is negative and if you integrate a negative value, then the result decreases with time, right
its comes out to be this, which i can write as equals: since l is much, much, much greater than one, l square over four rho squared is going to be much, much, much greater than one
outside the domain
now, for delayed entry as i had said in the previous diagram, suppose there is a delay in the entry by this much
the electric field would be pointing exactly the other way, so electric field points from higher to lower potential
so, it may at most occur after gcdf comma pi of a frame
so far we have discussed two types of biasing a transistor at a desired current
now, the next question is what will happen if i apply ac current
so, we are just added a comment about how the empty node is organized and the leaves are organized
similarly, use b point for the same radius; cut that first arc
another way is that as an alternative arrangement, the number of series field turns are varied by employing a tapped field control, in this case what happen
standard cost of labor minus actual cost of labor
9 into fub 410 into an an will be 200 minus 22 into 2 into t into splice plate we have provided in two side right here we have provided one here we have provided one with packing plate right so if this is t then the total thickness will be 2t okayay by 1
so, particularly if you look at these three figures, you will realize that there has been a major fall in operating cash flows which are somehow made good by reducing to some extent reducing investment and to some extent reducing their repayment of loan
so, i 1 is equal to i 2 plus i 3, this is equation 1 now, you apply kvl in loop 1, if you apply kvl in loop 1
so, we don't know how much we are going to pay in this month and how much we are going to receive this month, what is the position of our total receipts, what is the position of the total payments and what is going to be the net result of the cash
there are certain spikes as well we can see here and here
in normal processes we want the ettringite to form in the early stages of hydration, but some conditions may lead to a change in the early hydration situation and you may not form ettringite early enough and these ettringites slowly forms in the later ages okay
so, next is next is what we have done that this 4 this 4 and 4, 8
so, for this let us first write how this voltage changes in this period ok
and this is case study number five and we will conclude with this case studies series so this is education and extension services so we are talking of educational service marketing
algorithm is a header, which contains a whole lot of algorithm codes that you need to often use in your programmes
current now, flowing through the updated load resistors is now il dash
so 3 plus vi will be anywhere depending on the value of vi and when it becomes negative it can reach this point and the current can become 0
so, therefore, the average heating effect is proportional to i 1 square plus i 2 square up to i n square divided by n right
so, to reduce the cost of production these companies buy the wheat during the season
now then i1 you can easily write a i1 is equal to than v 1 divided by j omega l 1 plus j omega m your what you call this you can write this equation your v 1 is equal to your i j omega l 1 plus j omega m i 2 right so, i mean you i mean if you write equations l later we will see how to solve it for example, if you write v 1 is equal to your j omega l 1 right then i1 and this is your induce voltageyourdue to the mutual coupling this voltage source is added here
so, insert ninety one has no effect on this tree
when the objects are getting constructed, they are getting constructed one after the other
this will develop a magnetization in the direction of the applied field and therefore it'll develop a magnetization like this and that will give rise to additional magnetic field both inside and outside
so, we converted it to your kva and it is dependent on the square of the load
now the iron of the ferromagnetic material which is used to make the core, that is also not a non conductor, that is definitely a conductor
so, this will be this is not exactly needed to derive this boundary condition, but it is a good intuition to have ok
so, we i am not going into detail about this
so, why we have taken here the minus sign right so minus or plus, this is a question to you right same as capacitor i put this question
now, when you look at all these factors you will be able to say whether a particular invention when it hits the market what could be the commercial potential for that
and download would be with respect to the requirement of a student, what kind of a document or a image or a note they want to download
so, we know that in an electrodynamic instrument the difference is that the permanent magnet is replaced by electromagnets or solenoids coils
standard average required for actual output is 810 and this is 4
but if you talk about the mobile telephones, look at the service quality, look at the cost, the price they are charging from the people and the after sale service this is all very poor and people don't want to continue with them
but as you move up the lines become thicker so the resistance value is decreasing
so, that is the strategy that we will follow is it clear
so, if this current is flowing and how will it flow it will come to the capacitor only ok, because it cannot go inside the op amp
similar to the previous point we made, when you include chats or instant messaging what we need to do is design a learning activity around it
as you reduce k, the field b, which is like this, is going to start going down, right, as the field goes down, as the field becomes smaller and smaller
i know i know a definition of del cross any vector and i have to calculate it, if not analytically numerically
or i is equal to yv or y is equal to reciprocal of impedance that is called admittance just now we have seen right
so, genetics is coming from same thing maybe it is a common genetics, but the thing is that ok; people say in peace times they will say this, but when it comes to the crux of reacting most parents react in a way either in front of the child or behind the child in a very very if not idiotic, at least foolish way
so, earlier we had for longest common subword we had only this dependency this mean that even a square like this had no dependencies because there is nothing to its bottom right
so, the first step in our algorithm says to compute the factors of 14
in a small signal incremental equivalent circuit, it is not that every capacitor becomes a short
so, it means out of 170,000 units, if 150,000 units are going to the market, it means where this 20,000 units are, they are kept as closing stock
so, let us say that there is some observer standing over here in v 1 this observer and the source was over here right
so, code giving you a limit on the eccentricity ratio implies that you have to have construction detailing that ensures that the eccentricity is induced by the eccentricity of the load transfer by superimposed elements has to be curtailed
so you have a resistance rd and this
what i am to get as basically the voltage generated across the armature but one thing we have to be careful is because the series field is always connected in series with the armature i will have ra and rf series comparable with each other, what i mean is if i say it is 0
in the middle east a synonymous world is bukra which indicates a particular attitude, it means that what cannot be done today would be done tomorrow
then, unfold this box, so the front view comes at this level; the top view comes there; the right side view comes at this level; the left side view comes at that level and the back side view comes at this level
so the impedance here is in the form of a resistance division here another capacitance like that now this point for now let us say it is getting connected to this point we have the source connected here
so that means the scheduler runs more frequently if we choose a smaller frame size compared to a larger frame size
remember that it is our job to make sure that this while will eventually get out this condition will become false
then side view if we are going to look at it the projections onto that plane we have to get for this glass box method then that view comes at this level
so, it's a mere rearrangement of the previous set of expressions which are based on the deformation
with this triangular distribution we have done this earlier for the out of plane flexual mechanism we can write down the equilibrium and then get an estimate for the compressed length, eta, which is the length over which the combination of lateral force and axial force is being achieved
another solution is called art on shunt so, let me so, another solution another circuit which is like this
there are two types basically one is fe2o3 on soda lime, second one is chrome mask
in this discussion we mainly focussed about the rotational motion, so from next lecture onwards we will discuss about the correlation between electrical and the mechanical or other than the mechanical system so that you can understand how the mechanical system can be equivalently represented with the help of electrical circuit
you will not have helping hands at all
so, it has a real part which is well behaved and as an imaginary part that looks like log of rho and what is the value of log of rho as rho tends to 0 minus infinity right
normally we talk about the losses in the form of watts but here i am talking about it in the form of torque
the in plane flexure reinforcement and the in plane shear reinforcement
yeah in the huygens principle we have g of r comma r prime, but then you have to use these approximations and when you use this approximation that value of r cancelled off you do not need to substitute anything, if you have substituting it you are doing something wrong
a we are efficient one, b we are efficient most, c we are efficient most but in case of the d if this information comes to the mind of management that rather than manufacturing it ourselves, if we buy it from the market as ready made and sell it under our own brand name, then i think we can earn more profits
so, where do you look for a disclosure
we can also put it in this way
that means 85 percent strength got reduced
because, energy stored in the capacitor will be dissipated in the resistor
so i feel like at least if somebody else is benefitting from it, that is okay
don’t store your samples in calcium hydroxide solution which is what many people recommend in literature because it is not really calcium that is leaching out, it is actually the alkalides that leach out
so, for example, this solution over here, what will it become
he had circulated a questionnaire, during his preparatory research which had preceded the publication of this book
let us pose the question
after zero, this is 1; which means in the array i am accessing location 1
zd for some special types of transmission lines
however, the concept of switching should not be limited to the intentional actions of opening and closing of circuit breaker and switches
so, argmin means that x which gives the minimum of this expression s minus g s ux and that is my solution
so we looked at the basic concepts, various sources of power, dynamic power, static power, leakage power
if we look at the unique scheduler, it uses a multi level feedback queue
so, we are back again
take the plane to be y z plane
this armature reaction emf actually i can specify as a reactance drop as simple as that because after all it is due to flux and if i say armature reaction, armature current is probably along this direction the flux will also be along the same direction roughly
and you will get the values of equivalent star or equivalent delta circuit for the system
i should come back that is one answer any other answer
so we use phase sequence to obtain the other line currents because we know that the phase sequence is abc, so we can easily find out the values of ib and ic with help of current ia which we got from its single phase equivalent so as long as the system is balanced we need only analysis in case of single phase equivalent, so we can all we may do so even if the neutral line is absent because you can say that neutral is virtually connected for creating the single phase equivalent
you see now thermopile and actually measure the temperature
we have looked at chronemics as a part of our newly emerging understanding of nonverbal aspects of communication, but still it was based on cultural perception
so, suppose voltage is going down you have to change the tap the transformer such that, voltage can be raised to certain level, right
once we construct that, we have to re verify it whether that is matching the views
that means this is larger
so, notice, what we are saying is, even if this charge is not there, due to the presence of this original charge distribution of field is created inside
now, again we are printing, whatever we have received
so, this is your one edge comes in like this, the other edge if it comes like this
so, i have just rewritten that same equation now, i have the contrast term over here on the right hand side right
now i am going to kind of flip this secondary portion of the circuit such that the plus appears up so that as we are used to we would like to have the positive on top and the negative at the bottom
so so if your r is seventy five ohm and you are driving three points, then an effective load will be seventy five divided by three, twenty five ohm
so, i can model it in this manner
so, now if you see this particular node, what you can see
k is different from k naught
the portion where this enable is 1; that means, from here to here the output will be same as the input
5 weber, what i had as the armature reaction flux might have been 0
referring online as well as offline books like book a reference book
so let us see let us go one at a time
so, you can see that in this figure there are three different openings, there are two windows and one door opening of different sizes, each of them is of a different size
and that dot o file is getting, as you say, linked to your program
so, devil’s advocate will say now a competition is inherit in nature, but why teach them
5 terms right
it could be the same idea it could be the same main character who solves these plots, nevertheless each idea is expressed in a different format and because it is expressed in a different form each idea as it is expressed in a different form can have a separate right
now we will combine it with a the input is connected to the source terminal and the output is taken from the drain
so, to the power half right
so one of the outputs will be selected as one
so, one of the methods is actually taps in the field coil
so, this is the minus 1 inverting input and say this is the positive this is the non inverting input and here we apply this sine wave
the new concept over here is going to be that of the radar cross section which is abbreviated as rcs
so, with this information and the assumptions that i talked of in the previous slide, what do we do first
then we give a delay of 1 second and then again we are sending another at command where we are providing the mobile number to which the sms will be sent
so if you apply nodal analysis that means that you have to use kirchhoff’s current law here
finally, the last problem, which says that magnetic vector potential of on the z axis of this disc, which is rotating with omega and carries a charge, sigma will be we want to use this equation del square, a equals minus mu naught j
so, just to make the whole process coherent, the compiler will give you a free default constructor and the code will compile assuming that you have a free default constructor, you have default constructor
a card has an issue date, it has an expiry date and on the reverse of the card, we have a verification number call the cvv number
then we should understand how each thing helps us to understand for the design of the circuit
how does that help
now we will go to the next statement and we will try to find out the or prepare something which is called as the budgeted balance sheet
so if i am connecting commutator segment 1 like this let me look for where both conductors are carrying the current in either downward direction or upward direction
so, what is interesting to note that when you construct like this our basic principle of single inheritance tell us that there will have to be two person objects in the same ta object
so, having said this and again as i told you that i will be taking mostly the case of neurons here, because they are the most challenging ones
this diagram also retraites the findings of nlp which are helpful for us and we are told what may be the indications, if the person is looking at a particular direction
what is panic attack suddenly that your mind will go into a state where you will feel like as if your dying, your choking, your heartbeat going fast all that will happen is the self limiting think it will go on and settle down, but in that if you go in jump in a panic state, you will die
yeah that is why we are doing we are that is yeah so, to clarify that we are doing this breaking up
if the skilled person could not have come up with the invention, then patent law regards that as a work of invention or rather the patent law regards that there is an inventive step, which is similar to the contribution of a genius
we had seen a very simple event driven scheduler, the foreground background scheduler in the last lecture
so, it can get the u from the parent class b
so, if you want to have a common ground you can connect any point of this circuit whichever you want to take as the reference to this ground
so, now use sketch fillet, apply this, apply that; similarly apply that, apply this one, this one
but say for example, you have something like n l a o f p these are collection of alphabets, but they does not make any sense
let me give you a simple example, we will talk about that i will ask you later about dyslexia
so, with this let us conclude the today's session
now, we are done with that circle
so, not showing it you it is understandable, right it is understandable
on the next graphics that we see here, it is actually a continuation of the same process explaining about the formation of lightning
i canõt use larger 25 mm aggregates because this wonõt flow, the space between rebar is probably 10 or 15 mm so i need very very small aggregates to go in what kind of aggregates you can choose, how do i choose those family of aggregates
in fact i am going to solve that example later
so, that mean this one actually can be written as v angle phi
so, hydration is occurring and pores are being filled, so you see continuous increase in strength
in a vertical constraint graph, if you see that there is a path of length p, then you will need at least p horizontal tracks to route the channel
this correspond to the signal delays due to gate transitions
we are still basically running through all values in principle from 1 to the minimum of m and n
so, if i look into the memory, both i and j will actually represent the same memory location
so, we go from here right vg from here vg right then we go here this 1 minus vgs then we go here, here in this direction all right from here we go this way
27 into 10 to the power minus 4 meter square, now factor of safety is given 2 and ultimate tensile strength is given 32 in 10 to power 6 kg per meter square therefore, allowable tension t will be 32 into 10 to the power 6 then the cross sectional area you multiply in meter per meter square that is 2
every design always have tolerances, but that will be minimized through these engineering drawings whatever being supplied to the production guys
523
so, volt is across 2 ampere current source also 96 upon 7 volt right and let me clear it
consider the topology like this, both q1 and q2 are in series with the primary like this
but if you have a circuit where a current source is dissipating power, you could replace it with a resistor
i think you must spend enough time in understanding the philosophy of this
this is the vertical plane, let us use marking, this is the vertical plane and this is the horizontal plane
if i have a list l and if i insert with two arguments j and x, what it means is to put the value j before position j, put the value x before position j in particular if i insert at position 0, this has the effect of putting something before every element in the list
the next phase of addie is the design phase where we actually dive into designing the materials and this is what most of the rest of the course is going to be about
x cube by 6
now let's look at some basic terminology because we'll be using this terminology as we proceed
so that is the basic design considerations that go in and let us look at the solution
because distribution system substances transfer mode is there and without capacitor whatever transformer supply ah kv over supplying because of the shunt capacitors that kv supply will be reduced because of this shunt capacitor all the real power will remain same because we are not compensating any connecting any real power devices like such as distributed generation, but reactive power
of course with respect to the axis that you are considering
7 degree ampere right
but, certainly i could not have meant that because my names are different
since the inductor and the 2 ohm resistor are in parallel right
the capacitor is meant for creating some phase shift in the auxiliary winding current and this is the switch which will be opened once the motor starts
so, we have seen that, trademarks can be protected by two means, by a registration you can protect trademarks and a registered trademark can be enforced before a court of law
now we have to find out the reasons for that
you please draw the complete phasor diagram, i have not drawn for you right
in the same way, the way that data flows back and forth between memory and disk is in chunks called blocks
so, you are redefining a very new variable and then the double derivative of it will be same as this ok
i will have to evaluate the integral of g 1 over some segment and the integral of grad g 1 dot n hat these are the 2 functions whose integral i have to evaluate right, when we do the method of moments
here you can see clearly the background is there somewhere behind and the characters are one on top of the other, a layer you i can see it
but for a general say means full custom thing
and basically they were just 2 types of unit cells that we discussed, one was the constant k and the other was m derived
this is my metal oxide which is sio2 and this is my metal because we need to connect it to metal to take out the external connection
now, when there is the presence of gypsum, you have a formation of ettringite, okay
so, while we cannot have matching at all ports, we can have matching at one port, not more than 1 and along with that we can also have losslessness and reciprocity
so, he called the aliens methanians or methaniance
this distance between the two circles
so, this is the short circuit current i sc right and in this case in this case we at here we are taking i 1 and it is i 1 also this basically it is 2 ampere going upwards
high scores
when we connect this with stm, we will be seeing that we are mostly concerned about this x out, y out, and z out
they have no relationship to the phasor or the phase of the incident or reflected wave
what is the best way one can really have that surface
however, we find that in the workplace touch is always related to a goal or it is a part of a routine professional interaction
so what you see here this you have the control that means without any inhibitor and the recommended dosage of inhibitor for this case of inhibitor a you see significant increase in the, significant increase in the water sorptivity index, so this is not something which is good, so you have to see and we could find some other inhibitor where there is no change, so for example here you can see no change in the water sorptivity index but it is not in a good category concrete anyway, so you have to see all these things have to be thought through and tested before we really accept and use corrosion inhibitors but definitely it has an improvement and it can actually enhanced the corrosion resistance or chloride threshold in particular okay
so, this is a complicated network and call this point a and point b and you want to measure this voltage
but, may be that is some internally generated voltage for sure so, corresponding to the internally generated voltage i will have
so, current you have to flowing like this
whenever you will dump a code through this usb, you will see that this red/green led will glow
so, integrals form where to where
we all know we will dip our wafer in acetone what will happen
that is a field due to charge q plus field due to charge q
7624
so what if i delete any two of them and and i keep only a stuck at zero
2 degree
so, in this particular circuit, what we are looking at the lc tuned circuit forms a feedback network while an op amp or fet or bjt can be an active devices atin the amplifier stage right
we need to calculate the line currents and the neutral current for this particular arrangement where the za, zb and zc are given as za equal to 50 ohm zb is equal to 10 plus j 5 zc is equal to 6 minus j 8 ohm
so, at this position that current is called the full scale deflection current or fsd current of an meter
now i m is equal to v upon j x m
and i am going have r and x as here
now this method of the rietveld analysis is extremely powerful and really has made a revolution in the past two decades in the analysis of cements because of this problem of peak overlap
so here also i specifying the same specification for the caddy input and output
you will put that star into the delta and you will compare the equivalent resistances which you will see through these terminals and you have to just equate them
you see there six faults here
if, we assume that it starts from plus 15 volt it will stay at plus 15 volt it is not going to change
that may increase the switching delay of the transistors, the on zero to one, or one to one delay, or one to zeros delays
so, we will use this as a convenient method for finding out the transfer function of the network
the main function of the de manatizing winding is when the switch is off, the energy in the core is put through the de magnetizing winding into the supply
not all the radiation is going to go into free space newly with that ok
so it means you are given the information like that is the standard information is given to us that is the 10 kgis of the standard material is required to manufacture the one unit of the finished product
now again, this as i have marked at the bottom here is an assumption
i hope you understand so it will essentially allow a path for the current
of course it is not a foolproof method, there could be still some errors but largely it helps us in finding out many of the errors
researchers at carnegie mellon university’s robotics institute have enabled a computer, which can understand the body poses and movements of multiple people from video in real time
so, you would find that a positive touch can nurture the feelings of another person; however a negative touch can also pass on other negative associations related with anxiety at the same time a suggestion of aggression or even a possibility of violence by physically hurting or showing someone etcetera
the hypothesis in this particular criterion is that sheer failure is occurring when the principal tensile stress reaches a value of the tensile strength of masonry
so if the inverter width is w, typically pmos is larges, as said, because of the slower mobility of the holds
suppose, i, i be the value of the direct current to produce the same heating in the same resistor as produced by a your by alternating current, right
it is also known that when we address the individual needs of a learner then learning is improved, engagement is enhanced and at least there is support for continuous learning within this medium
this is a 2, all r 2 x 2 v 2 r up to square plus x 2 square everything is written here, re calculated and i am writing here
5 radius so i keep increasing this until i touch the data equation
do not get confused when i am drawing cross section, this is your silicon dioxide sio2, si
there is one more which is actually electric machinery by chapman stephen chapman, these are from pearson, and one more indian author book, probably electric machinery by or by electrical machine by nagarathan kothari
we are going to be looking at point, going to be looking at about 2% of the compressive strength, less than 5% of the compressive strength
so, on the x axis if you notice, we are looking at it from the customer point of view
now, what we are going to do is increase this voltage slowly until this current reads rated current
and rubrics are effective for complex tasks such as longer problems which have various aspects of criteria that need to be used to give feedback
so, it will be 3 v p i p conjugate will be 2087 plus j 834
so, in general what is it
it's already a preformed crack plane that you have and it's just going rocking along that crack plane
divide by sigma i mean you will divide the numerator and denominator by sigma and take the limit correct, what will you get update equation
so, anyway come to the next problem
if you wanted to get a even more accurate answer for the same integral, the next step logically you can see this was order 0, this was order 1; order 2 means i what is a kind of curve that i will fit
the only way the energy can go in and come out is through interaction of fields with charges and currents
whereas, the behavior of the stack will be defined by the methods that it support, specifically the empty top push and pop, which together allows us to define the lifo behavior of the whole data structure
the reason is in the case of both beryllium and magnesium you also have the p shells and the p shells are empty
once we have a file open, let us see how to read
so, this information indirectly is being encoded into the scattered field
keep in mind that the three dimensional word, e goes one over r square a
i can have basically lower current being drawn by a synchronous machine of the same capacity to deliver the same amount of power as that of an induction machine
that the problem solving will be done by the teaching assistants who have been involved in this course
so, the tlb would be fully associative cache and it is expected that due the locality of the execution and memory accesses you are quite lucky to find the mapping of virtual to physical address present in the tlb and a lot of overheads will be reduced
so for our experiment, it is required to ensure that there is a hyper terminal installed in the computer
so, let us say just to the left of x prime and just to the right of x prime right there are string that is coming it cannot suddenly shoot up it is a string it cannot break
so rather than mentioning this as if, let me mention this as if dash
so, how to choose these w ms we will look at in detail in the following slides ok, but if the basic idea here is enough equations in enough variables that is the objective ok
chromosomes usually this is how you see and then on the right hand side you see the dna structure the double helical structure and the genes
we assumed courant stability factor is being satisfied, still we found that solutions were not always accurate, what was that dispersion right
so, the value of current going outside the node, this current would be the value of node voltage
if virtual shorting works then this potential call it v a this you can call v b then v a will be equal to v i 1
so, bringing in an expression for e as m by n into this equation, we are able to get an expression which now depends on the aspect ratio of the wall
there is a good dissection you can record it and that could be a tool for cell culture facility, that you know this is how we isolate the tissue
to fix, this we will have to make another relation that this surface of this pin is supposed to be tangent over the cylindrical surface of this piston
so, that is the thing; so, anyway cleaning this right
1 ohm 0
after having done that so, far we were still dealing with free space then we introduced materials right
you just may have to copy and paste it if it is a fedora system or equivalent to type in the command line commands if it is any other linux system
dimensions we have already learned, using smart dimensions i can always adjust this
just this one change if you make, then you will be able to handle this unequal block sizes
so, use triangle, tool bit always be in this downward direction, constructed remove this one, zoom in
example
and this understanding is very helpful particularly when we have to make presentations or when we have to talk to people in a small group or we want to persuade somebody to look at things from our perspective
so what you can do you can use simple relationship is ir and using super position theorem you can find out the value of voltage across resistor using super position theorem
so, let us validate the claim that keys are not kept in any particular order
we have already done one case, now we will go for the second case
therefore some emf will be induced in this along this line on this plate ok
integrally
correspondingly, i would be able to control the starting torque quite effectively in a series motor drive
so, same voltage we will impress across your 20 ohm resistance
but neuroscience is saying 90 percent of the process are unconscious
now, what if v ivi is less than v cvc, v i is less than v c in this case in this case my diode will be reverse bias right
ok, now let us move into some methods which are little more practical in the sense that we have lot more flexibility here
that means, this 100 by 40 plus 6 into 60 by 6
so, from this the estimate of the ultimate moment is arrived that as the axial force, the total axial force into the eccentricities and each of these elements have different eccentricities and therefore the total moment resistance at ultimate is arrived at by multiplying each of these contributions into the lever arm that is available
the task t2 requires 8 millisecond execution time but has a period 30 millisecond
so, for tangent for tangent mate we need some curved geometry
and there are there is a operational amplifier, we have connected this operational amplifier
and then what happens that once you establish that type of a behavior because of this reinforcement you search for variation that would come very closer to what you wanted and this is what gives you a very unique touch and of course, skinner also talked about behavior modification
this is minus 6
so, le is de τe lh is dh and τh
our requirement in the previous month was 37,000 worth of dollars
now, if you are a trading entity, you will buy goods and sell them as it is as finished goods that will be an example of stock in trade sometimes even manufacturing companies buy finished goods sell finished goods so whatever you have purchased as a ready item what raw material you have consumed will be in item number one but what you have purchased and sold as it is to the customer that will be shown as purchases of stock in trade
um at the point of oscillation however, in order to insure stability there is a condition called kurokawar condition which states that betaé if this condition is satisfied, here note this r in and x in our real and imaginary parts of z in
absolutely as i said 70, 80 percent people are having problems of living
77 microfarad, correct
here i am not putting i a, i b, i c, but understandable right
for a given value of input voltage and given value of time constant, if i have to find the output voltage
so, if you integrate it, it will be 1 upon pi i m minus cos theta 0 to pi right
so, the video extensometer can detect between any given 4 points or 5 point or any n number of points given in the framework of the video
so, this integral equation that we got comes in quantum mechanics scattering equations also; so, say this is the same born from quantum mechanics and the physics people call it lippmann schwinger equation and electrical engineers call it fredholm integral equation this is the same thing
that means when we are going to design there may be chances of failure at certain localized point because of concentration of stress
so the programming part talks about what is the best way to express a given idea in a program in a way that it is easy to make sure that it is correct and easy to read and maintain, so that is the programming part
shareholder is one source but you know there are lenders in the form of bankers, in the form of institutions, in the form of debentureholders, they are also stakeholders
so, this is the first face, second one and third and forth faces
so, that is why i writing note that for t less than 0 u t is equal to 0 and for t greater than 0 u t is equal to 1 right
first i will speak about responsive design
fill the material
so, this is your 1
we saw that in rule 13, we had seen rule 13 and what are the functions of the abstract
so in that case for the unbalanced three phase system, the various electrical parameters can be calculated by direct application of either mess of nodal analysis
for example, companies operating into four markets and we come to know that our production capacity is more and these four markets are fully saturated now
so whatever is coming out of the two port is less than or equal to at most equal to the power delivered by the source v1
so, it is one reason to promote it
so, if it and this same way the voltage will be induced right, but if you look into that this is that instant the and this is a particular position right instantaneous position we call
for if you see, this kind of delay adjustments are very commonly required for timing driven adjustments and ah constraints, satisfaction
first, draw directrix ab on axis cc prime
if i say v is angle 0, in one case ef becomes ef plus delta which is in the case of generator
now for z21, z21 is defined as v2 upon i1, what would be the value of v2
if you look at the implementation aspects that we are considering, it's linear for rate monotonic schedulers because if you remember, it said that there are fixed priorities and then the implementation that we had, we could run the scheduler in o 1 priority
thats why we needed a buffer here
and then after this we shall install octave
8 just check
so, from that you can make out what will be the value of v s dash, because it is decreasing because i into x c part is getting decreased right
now this is gmvgs, gate, source and drain
now, the notation here for saving drawings is because solidworks use a specialized format for saving drawings, there is something like part option sld part
so only impressed current technique will probably work yeah, so in that case impressed current techniques can do it
but if c adjacent is very small, then delta v aggress
so across every such blocks, pair wise, if you compute the boolean difference and if you cannot establish that a transition here can propagate, here you can say that this path is not false
you have not to assume any bad debts because normally when we sell on credit, it is always expected in the businesses that part of the credit says will be irrecoverable and they will turn as bad debts
so, you have to have an animal sacrificing facility and you take the tissue out whatever concern tissue and now you have to do everything in the hood
and if some reason you have to change the selling price, reduce the selling price, you easily know i can control my variable cost and you will focus upon that
the hero suffers for 2 hours in half hour happy ending or poetic ending is done
in that case there is a possibility that vs maybe maybe depends on the current and line parameters; vs maybe less than or greater than vr also; either way it is true
so, with this we complete our discussion on the major milestones globally as well as within the country and now in our third lecture that we would be talking about the methods that psychologist have broadly adopted to understand the psychological principles
so, we already are aware of scope like block, we know that every function has a scope; we know class has a scope, class some, class name has a scope
there are two things: what is the width of this lines
so, you can make it ah that k we have to apply kvl and accordingly we have to solve it
i would like to refer to two earlier modules; module 9, where we a discussed about overloading operator plus for structured types, enumerated types to show that the operator plus can be overloaded for a string structure to mean concatenation of strings
so, this is what happens at e1 and then the control moves on
and similarly, this also is a delta connected section
now the for the reason of power conservation the energy supplied to the primary should be equal to energy absorbed by the secondary
because of which i am going to have definitely reduction in the flux will cause an increase in the speed
so, we have looked at 2 optoelectronic devices where we have an input electric current giving you an output light both led’s and lasers
so i can find out pu2 like this ok
in that, we have covered focus directrix method, concentric circle method, rectangle method or oblong method and in today's class, we will look at arc of circle method in this arc of circle method, an ellipse with major axis is known perhaps let us say in this case 100 mm, and the distance between foci is now something like 70 mm
so what is the physical, you can say implication of pitch
so, metals are characterized by having a continuous valence and the conduction band so that, they are filled an empty states and e f that is the fermi energy, represents the gap between the filled and empty state
hence, the capacitor will be disconnected right as if the d a circuit is, circuit is open
there is no connection between the two
we can also strip from the left using l strip or we can strip on both sides if we just say strip without any characterization l or r
this is a straightforward story with no conflict, nothing going on
so the yellow portion is the one which will be appearing across the inductor and there should be a second balance between the top portion of the low and the bottom portion of the waveform above and below the average value so the yellow portion of the waveform is what is called the uh the l or the voltage across the inductor
so, every time i add a new type to my system if it can be compared and i want to do a max, i have to write a separate code
suppose you have a signal flow graph diagram like this, then this is equivalent to this
so, rth is nothing but 5 ohm
further, it categorizes the flows under the three heads that is operating, investing and financing
earlier we did it by moving a gate around, but here lets see this ten
so, it will be 12 it is a writing error
so, if i have forcefully cast it as said that this is what i want
left hand side minus right hand side is called residual
so, now, this was the motion study in the solidworks features
it is also very much used in project management
and in the negative cycle in the negative cycle current is flowing from here its like this, then it has two parts one through the diode and then through the meter let me use a different color for greater visibility
it is almost still because of which you will get omega, directly whatever is the rotating speed that will become omega as to calculate whatever is your loss torque or the power
and this object will be projected here and this circle will be projected here
i solve it i get the solution and this is what the sorry the so charge density this is what it looks like
if v p is higher, output is positive if v n is higher output is negative
ok, this is what we have today
it is not possible to do away with pointers and reference really had a value, but there are languages where you do not have both these mechanisms
now, no need to repeat again and again
we know that there is exactly one queen in each row
vd set will occur when you reach condition vds requires to vgs minus vg
because they will always remain together
t is nothing but transmission parameter right, which is also called as abcd parameter
now, is it a good sign
when we are looking at this 8 mm and this 8 mm are in parallel with this parallel with that
so, this is the way we construct a tangent and this is front view
so, the conclusion i mean now if i when i try to interpret from here, my interpretation is, coordinate stretching is equivalent to generating a or representing an evanescent wave
i will reply right, right or wrong
so for your linux procs you can actually change the value of the aslr by editing this particular file, /etc/sysctl
from the output side we are saying that, well, at time into of five, i want the output to be stable
so as we see a problem in this whole process would be that school having that basic infrastructure to incorporate something like this
the channel is not there in depletion type the channel and in enhancement the channel is already existing
so, when the main function invokes the scan function this is how the stack is going to look like
that is what i mean by having a prime mover, the prime mover can be a turbine, the prime mover can be a winter bine or ic engine or whatever does not matter, but it can also be gravitational pull
so, here this whole expression is coming up if you do not have these then the precedence of this question mark colon and the precedence of the output indirection operators are in the wrong order
so i am talking about 220 volts as the rated voltage in this particular case
so, if i were to plot as a function of z what the pml is actually accomplishing let us say that this is z is equal to 0 and this is like the amplitude of the wave this enters inside it begins to decay
it may not be true now, but initially patents were granted if that invention would lead to the creation of a new industry or a market
in a similar manner, when i have magnetic field b r as curl of a r, i can also write this curl of a r plus gradient of some other quantity, let's chi r, because curl, the gradient, is always zero and therefore a r is defined within, within variant of a scalar field
and you will use the same n type semiconductor as an example
notice that this is exactly like the wave equation, with this quantity here being one over c square right
so, this is e for theta equal to may be 10 degree and so on
the disadvantage of wet oxidation is that the quality of the oxide suffers due to diffusion of the hydrogen gas out of the film which creates paths for electron flow
9 minus 19
i am not telling that this multimeter is better than this multimeter
the maximum value the range of the digital output is 0 to 1
so, our next step is we have got d n the next step is going to be put it into update equation right that is a logical next step
the cultural differences are also there, but these differences in the personalities are also understood on the basis of the use of illustrators
so, then upon simplification we got that your minus 3 v 1 plus 5 v 2 is equal to 60
obviously we believe in it but how do we convince
in this way i can fill up the entire row and say that all along this row there is only one path namely the path that starts going right and keeps going right
when you come to r 1 2 delta here right; here when you come to forget about this thing that r 1 2 delta this side nothing is connected right
102 micro farad per kilometer
they have also come up with certain performance indicators for the co2 emissions, for thermal energy and electricity and this are some of them
so, what are the fixed assets here
so, even at an algorithmic level or a behavior level, what are the techniques that you can follow that will ultimately result in a reduction in power
so, in this case when you talk about that fixation of the selling price, you have to divide your total costing structure into two levels and then adding of the desired amount of margin
how to calculate these variances
i will bring so many other problems here and then we will discuss these problems and we will try to know about the same process of calculation of the different variances but before doing this kind of the problems in the next class i will discuss with you first the formulas of calculating the different variances and then we will solve these problems so first we will start with the material variances then we will move to the labor variances then we will move to the overhead variances so that all i will discuss with you in the next class thank you very much so, i'm going to be the
but if someone is accustomed to old kind of format like stl kind of forms, then importing those things slight issue and one may require additional supports and modules which is very minor thing
so i am going to have essentially a current emanating from here going through the load and going back ultimately to the minus
so, my measured points will be this, after that the next point is here, after that the next point is here and so on right
now there are some further refinements
so, impulsive voltage and currents occur in electric circuit as a result
this is a very effective strategy in a dialogue between a superior and subordinate
1 is a fairly good assumption to work with, you might not get something more than that
ok, so the app here a is referred to, has ah student my m q t t, which you can download from google play and you can see it is a very simple ah ah interface
03 right
this aligned section says, we can represent these removal and representation by two ways; one straight away see that in the projectional view, how it looks like, the other way is rotate this object all the way down how that really represented, that kind of use if we are showing, that we call aligned sections
therefore, v 1 is equal to 2 i 1, that is 2 into 1
this is the important part or important chunk of the course, and we will also see an application of the mosfet in terms of current period
so, i 1 plus i 2 is equal to i therefore, i 3 is equal to i, this is also i have marked as equation 9
ok, so this diagram actually summarizes whatever i have said diagrammatically: that if you distribute the buffers along the branches of the clock tree, so along each, each branch, there will be a resistive and capacitive effects shown like this, but this will restricted to shorter wire segments, so the rc delays for each of the segments will be much less
now, question is that ah as soon as it is ah as soon as it is sorted, if you look into the circuit, if you look into the circuit as this path is as this path is sorted ah as this path is sorted, this is sorted right
if we are looking at only the induced emf, which is in the inductance, which is there in the inductance
so, and that is why i 0 is equal to i write it 20 ampere that is the initial current right
so, in the count can be either 9 or it can be 10; if the count is 9, then what will be the estimated frequency or measured frequency; what will be our estimate
if you are manufacturing 5,000 units you are spending on the material accordingly
now this is more like, the patent office would like to know how other patent officers are dealing with the same application
so, what we will do is, we will add a position of m to indicate that we have crossed the last letter
so, templates is not only a program, but it is a meta program which generates other programs so, we will cover this in two modules, naturally the objective will be to understand templates
so, we have selectively reinforcements in our life certain responses are reinforced certain responses are not reinforced we follow the pattern of successive approximation and gradually we are molded we are shaped and what shape finally, we take is what you can call that this is our personality
so if we this integral, ah, you can, sigma r would be canceld out
now, because marks can have this creative association, there was an incentive to invest in quality
so, i am going to assume that over each time interval electric field does not change right
i choose it to be equal to each of the basis functions that is galerkin’s method ok
so, you apply this particular equation and find out the value of p max
so, several types of transducers are based on capacitance and inductance
now you will see that many of this techniques
lets say we have a circuit with three inputs, two outputs and three flip flops or state variables
this net file is being called in the forward
one is sustainability you have to make sure that you are using less cement as possible so you can use lot of other base materials
so, if i draw the timing diagrams then, if this is i 1
yeah, we take two points and across those two points you connect this and so, that is why that is i have shown the leads like this one is connecting here the other is connecting over here right across some gap delta
what we have seen earlier inverting, then we have seen summing, then we have seen non inverting amplifier right
so average value of vp will be v0 and i know that the high time is d t s and the low time is 1 minus d t s and the average is given by n times v n into d now this is n times v n times v n now d as defined here where the t s is one period of the pole voltage
similarly for i y, what you can write
under bank there are two items, current account balances and short term deposits and short term investments in mutual funds
if you look in to the problem, if you look in to the your what you call problem that your allowing 250 watt for the copper loss right in the short circuiting gear
in this lecture i will be talking about mbed c programming environment
this circuit has all the required electronic circuit inside it, so that when you interface it, it becomes very easy for the user
now corresponding to the distance travel, the reflections are you are what you call determine by multiplying the incident wave by the appropriate reflection coefficient
now the schedulability analysis become easy when we handle sporadic tasks through a polling server
i am going to take the limit epsilon tending to 0
i am going to have actually 50 hertz will be induced, if i am going to have revolution or revolution speed corresponding to this particular 50 hertz itself
that is, maximum available gain
so, for example so, what i can do from here is extract out the common partial derivative terms ok
second item is reserves and surplus
iot constitutes the larger picture, of course it is not only one embedded system, it is a collection of many embedded systems that can communicate among each other as well
yeah in the total field formulation
so, psychology when it said emotions, it took it back 5000 years into epics and to neuroscience
ok, now the typical physical design flow starts with something called chip, chip planning
so this refers to the pitch
similarly, you can also see that is voltage across this would be same so you can club both of them and find out also the voltage v naught so, in both of the cases you will get the same voltage
in other word if you really master this technique of density gradient centrifugation depending on the size or the volume of the cell size includes here of course, there you can separate out the cells
and here this one is equal to your x l 2 is equal to omega l 2 and this one your x l 1 is equal to omega reactance of coil 1 reactance of coil 2 and j is the because it inductive coil and this is j is there because it is inductive coil and this is your mutualreactance right
so, in our next video we will talk about multi range ammeters and we will stop in this video here
5 to the value x to the name x coordinate, or we can take a slice we can say that if we want only 7 and 2013, we take date and take the slice from one to the end then we will get 7 comma 2013
so, if it has to get destructed what will get called first, so this is what you cannot see actually what the compiler has put here invisibly is a call to the destructor of d
therefore we can say that edf is not really very runtime efficient
the first thing what you have to observe front view, top view and left side view, they make 90 degrees thing
the c value is given by the equation that we just now derive i 0 by 2 f into delta vr
so, typically, supposing you wanted to implement a current source which was on at some particular time instance
we had said that some of the blocks are flexible in terms of their height and width, but the area was fixed
so, the center will be done, after that we have to draw 40 axis diameter circle, that means, 20 millimeters radius we are going to pick
if they are wearing a shirt, you would find that some type, some variation of a collar pull would be there, some scratching of the neck, etcetera would also be there
you can see if i take del dot a over here what am i going to get; i am going to get x plus partial with respect to y, partial with respect to z and as going to be equal to 3 right so, it is a non zero quantity
what is this a total amount is
if vs changes to 6
so i specify how the computer should behave now, the from
because it will that is the thing right and another this these a, b, c, d the actually this five your what you call ah advantages for under distribution system; other three regarding the generation and transmission site but when i will come to the end all this point i will take and i will explain how is it right
now for all numbers in the range 1 to n plus 1, which means from 1, 2 up to n
this is equal to 1 over the input intercept point of the first stage like this
let us assume x is a variable which is equal to at
so it has been found that this is this is one segment of the pi model
they are used for interconnection
suppose at steady state this capacitor will act as open circuit; that means, circuit will be something like this, right
basically you can share your experience not only from sibm, your entirely, from your entire learning experience you can tell us how you probably approach examinations
now, function template again you do not know, but when you come to that you will understand how that works
then we had to calculate the labor cost variance
so, that we are not going to get any shock because you are going to have the the body of the machine also being grounded
the first thing is, i am sorry; the first thing is data members
so, the idea is if you have put, in this union if you have put the structure for a circle you set gcode to cir, which is 0; if you have put in this union, the structure for a rectangle, then you put gcode as rec and so on
therefore, v is equal to your i r, so this is 2 ampere and this is 4 ampere
they don’t trust or they don’t get all the electricity from the grid they have their own power plant to give them the electricity that they require and there is also a small amount of water that is required for the cement manufacture
several errors particularly mean that we cannot proceed further than that
so, the way we design learning extension trajectories is to provide resources for different needs of learners with where it is deliberately designed
whereas, if i look at an induction motor i can say normally the impedances, series impedances will add up to 25 to 30 percent
5 now the non dimensional slenderness ratio also we can find out that is lambda z that will be fy by fcc so this we can find out fy by fcc we know that will be fy into klz by rz whole square by pi square e right so we can find out this value as 250 into kl is 3500 and rz was 161
so, let us call 6 prime, 7 prime, 8 prime, 9, 10 dash done
any example of inquiry learning spaces that we see here the scenario is what affects the floating or sinking of an object
this is my sensor, but instead of using this i will use this substrate, i will use an insulator, i will have my interdigitated electrodes, and i will have my sensing material
a stack is typically used to keep track of recursive function calls where we want to keep going through a sequence of functions and then, returning to the last function that was called before this
so you can have one small modification to this z s a algorithm
so, this minus sign is taken out here it is minus tan inverse 1 upon omega c by r, but minus is here
we force the buffer to overflow and the payload which was present in the buffer to execute
and there is going to be a summation over small n is equal to 1 to m capital n sorry
if you have an infill panel that is sitting between reinforced concrete columns within a frame, then those could be assumed to be providing rigid support because they are non moving supports
let us run this example in python
so, i had told you that go to your balance sheet of your company and see the sign of this item
we will have helper class for contact, the minimum information of a contact is a phone number and name and optionally we could have a photo of that contact also
so, this term is will be your ah i r, because i have taken small r, small x resistance reactants i r and this is 90 degree with this right, and this is will be just ah somewhere here it is right
because whenever you are adding extra information such as extra background music or extra sounds, it actually overloads your working memory and therefore, or it prevents you from the process of learning better for your students or from the process of learning better whenever you are creating the content for your students
and it’s now popularly known as triz, t r i z
pick first point somewhere click, left click, right click, sorry left click only, second one, the third one click then move it
because now i have r1 and r2 in the for the amplification, for the changing of the gain, you can change the gain with the help of r1, we can change the gain with the help of r2 or actually in combination of r1 and r2
so this is going to be 400 newton meter which is actually minus 400 newton meter
because everywhere current is entering into the your positive polarity of the resistance
components
so total effect of financing, total effect of financing is how much negative
so, in that case there are some sectors which are the priority sectors for the government, government is going to support
so, when python has to remember values it has to represent this value in some internal form and this has to take a finite amount of space
then all my equations have only spatial derivatives, the time derivatives have gone
this is topic one, and who initiates the topic
again those corrections will be direction dependent
these entire points will be focused at one point
one of them, various kinds of noise power that we see depends on what kind of spectral density they have, what kind of spectral distribution they have
so it becomes a non dimensional parameter
so we typically give our specification in terms of a description language, which you call as hardware description language or h d l
they know it that selling at 9 rupees is also not possible for the new player
so it means that if you have the magnetically coupled circuit and you have the coupling coefficient equal to one that means the circuit which has perfect coupling will be the ideal transformer
in some cases we need what we called active bias circuit so what is an active bias circuit
so, this was also clubbed together and its input was delta f now, in the input was delta f
or if the control voltage is higher than the triangle, you could get the inverted wave shape like this
so, i can write this as r square d cosine of theta, because this angle is theta d phi times d r, where d r is this distance along the radial direction
so white are the pores and the black is the solid and now we are pushing mercury and from the side and you see even though the pores here in the middle may be quite large, they do not get access until we have the mercury, high enough pressure that we can access through this small entrance
if you want to carry on the business you have to arrange $318,000 and this amount will come from borings from the bank
yet another example of isa relationship could be from the employee domain
you will not be blank and you know this is how it works
research level thing yeah
so i just write about that short para, very short one line or two lines, which will recollect me the entire example the next day and which will help me to write down that example in the exam
it is gave you bunch of numbers from that, how will you accurately get grad phi
the consultant found out that it is because of the lack of eye contact that the american delegation has reached this conclusion
there are several others, like replacing elements in an array, rotating the order of elements
ok, so, continuing with our discussions, we now look into the diffusion and polysilicon layers
so, first we should understand that v g s on its 4 volts, i d on its 3
and this is going to be core losses, right
ok, this is the zone representation and from this problem again, you can define the vertical constraint graph: one on top of three, four on top of five, five on top of three and so on
the typical nozzles have one particular kind of functional relations, they can be converging, they can be diverging, they can be both converging diverging kind of nozzles
so, to allow thatrate[e] your full load current to flow or rated current to flow, this short circuit; this low voltage side, it needs very small voltage right
if you summarize the existing knowledge on memory system, then our sensory register mostly gets information from the visual, auditory and the haptic senses
1994 it will become 2
amplification is done by substituting the values of or selecting the values of r1 and r2
now i think it's fine
if the feet get jiggly and do a little dance the person is happy or excited or both
d by dx was it plus or minus for the right hand boundary
we have to take the phase current which we derived and apply kcl at the notes a, b and c
the a b is not a true length, neither a b is true nor a' b' is true length
so, let us see how what are the parameters and how we can design the circuit or how this will affect the overall performance of the circuit
before using them, it is always good to know what the sensors are, how they work and some basic idea as to how they can be interfaced with the microcontroller
you can see this is all empty, only thickness is of this particular wafer
so basically you remember only one set with repositioning of the decimal point and then you say that this very information this is how it moved
i will show that also which would be a still better circuit
here we are not saying that framing action is available though the ties are all interconnected, we are not looking at framing action
and i have used positive photoresist; that means, i will retain the similar pattern that i had on the mask on the wafer correct
so, the minimum number of bars that you should provide in a reinforced masonry column is 4 bars, minimum percentage being 0
for the traditional operating system, not only that the kernel should become preemptive, that is even if it is running in the kernel mode, the kernel code is executing, still it should be able to preempt the kernel code and also we should be able to handle nested interrupts
so, here in this particular case we used current division method
so, once again i must mentioned that i could go in a in a slightly slower manner, i could just take t a 2 ones that 1 equation, take t take t take t b 2 ones get another equation this is like a shortcut that we do we will take at the same time
so, then we have to dispense the photoresist using a dropper
then we have got port 1 or p 1; so this p 1 so this is clear
so once we you know once we draw this signal flow diagram what happens is that at the point of oscillation what happens at the point of oscillation, at the point of oscillation this z in, which is primarily a function of the amplitude of oscillation should be equal and opposite or negative of the impedance offered by the resonator
so, what you get as d data is completely wrong
so, this is the definition of a divergent integral you can try it out for the other case log of x, you will find out that it is convergent and there is no problem therefore ok, but 1 by x has this problem therefore, it is a divergent integral
since, it is dynamic allocation, so the user has full freedom as to when to allocate; when to create the object by new and when to destroy it by delete
sometimes we also come across what is known as fidgeting feet; fidgeting feet are opposite of the relaxed feet position and they suggest the hurried attitude of a person to move away from this position, to leave the situation and flee
and then back to the steel that meant, we can interrupt the current and therefore measure it
even though the system has flaws, malware is actually prevented from entering into the system due to the sandbox container that is present in the system
therefore, r is equal to w s c upon i s c square
so it tells us that the reaction is fast and we can expect reaction to complete in seven to ten days completely
so, that was our target
now, for the inductor l what we will do
then you have to realize in that objective line, am i going to use live animals
so, in this case we assume in this case, again we assume i is equal to i m sin omega t right
z component is going to be positive, alright
so, i have, so, why does this what is the advantage of doing this my unknowns are the tangential components of the field right, if i go along any 1 of the edges what will i get i will get 1 or minus 1
the construction is complete
should we be testing concretes
so, what i am getting is not directly im in amperes, i am rather getting im multiplied it by rs in volts
so, then this will be the pattern at t 2 and then we will go down further ok
so, when you apply a voltage source to a circuit there would be a sudden impulse which would be generated in the circuit
now what is expected is that for a good puf the inter chip variation should be maximum, so this means that the response of a should be as different as possible from the response of b
so, and dot is marked here in the reference polarity plus
so, what will happen if you write vt is equal to vm cos omega t plus 5, so real term of that because we know that cos 5 is equal to real of e to the power j 5, we can write this same expression as real of vm e to the power j
we had already said that the basic assumption in this completion time theorem due to liu lehuzki is that the worst case phasing occurs when a task arrives with its higher priority
in these situations if it is suggested and authenticated by the rest of the kinesics signals, then it reveals the insecurity of a person
so this phi actually i can write this as b multiplied by a, and i can write this as you know if i write n also here, then i should say h times l, maybe h times l by n, i can write it like this
so admin to a content review team where they will review all the content, like sir said, where the students are coming, editing the content, where they will review all the content like sir says, that where the students are coming, editing the content
that is the a symmetry here
origin so i should include it right
this is actually the bh loop, i think this is the no load test
so, from this you will get cos theta is equal to 0
this one you just expand it in sin a cos b when plus your what you call cos a sin b, and you multiply
so, it is called actually water hammer effect right
so what it does is that it has a main function and an invocation to this function which is passed parameters 1, 2 and 3 and as we have seen in the previous videos this function just defines two buffers, buffer 1 of 5 bytes and buffer 2 of 10 bytes
so, state equation and differential equation can be shown in the extension of signal flow graph that is nothing but the state diagram now the significance of the state diagram is that it forms a close relationship among the state equations
so, the address lines that are generated from the microprocessor the address bus, so this address bus it has to go through a decoder address decoder and accordingly it will generating a number of enable lines and this enable lines are to be connected to the chip select lines this enable line has to be connected to the chip select line so that based on the address that is generated so one of these devices will get selected and from the data of bus i can connect to all these devices this data bus can be connected to all these devices
we have evaluated the constraints on small signal y parameters in order to maximize the gain of a two port amplifier
you should have some basis for arriving at the strength of the constituents in the actual structure
0 is up to 4 mbps
so my final expression for the auxiliary field of a point dipole is one over four pi three m dot r r minus m by r cube
therefore, one way of dealing with diagonal bending has been to use the e line analysis which has actually been developed for reinforced concrete slabs to estimate a capacity for out of plain walls subjected to diagonal bending, subjected to two way bending
i the output expression, u and v are the inputs and s is the select
so, people sitting in the office, they cannot make the policies, they cannot set the effective targets until unless they get the rightful information from the level where it is going to actually come up or take place
say for instance, you are a black eyed person the color of the eye ball is black and you realize that one of your child has a brown eye ball
so, first let us keep 315, click ok; once it is done normal to that plane, construct anything
so, inside compound generator i can have long shunt short shunt this is depending upon the connection
i is 1893 part 1, 2016, where you have the general provisions for the design, earthquake rest in design of structures
and this c to d line also invisible, so we will have that dashed line
these are constructors, so we call them as conic curves
so, int represented whole numbers or integers, and float represented values which have a decimal point
and then we shall install ng spice, a very popular package for circuit simulation
that is the point that we need to understand
on that i will make operation like remove that portion, remove that portion
so, cos theta is equal to r upon root over r square plus omega l square
so, overall the drop that is taking place here, i would say the drop is generally small, unless i deliberately design a bad transformer which is generally not done
7 right from here from this equation 8 i 1 you got 43
5 ampere right
and then, look at here, earlier it was returning x
and we know that vds has to be greater than vgs minus vt for the transistor to be in saturation
so, this is the how the resistors can be measured all, right excellent
so this is step 2
so, to have a desired gain we have to set the value of gm and to set the desired value of gm, we have to set the correct operating point for the mos transistor
now, let us look at different views for this, the isometric
so i f dash is the equivalent ac current that i am visualizing such that the strength of the magnetic field would be the same as that of the rotor magnetic field right
that as a team we need to perform better
so, when we are using wireframe models, these vertices adjust their links
let us ask a question there is a point a which is 20 millimetres above horizontal plane
the leave instruction essentially restores the stack frame such that the old frame corresponding to the previous function in this case the main function is restored, and the return would then return back to the main function
because ampere’s law essentially says that the magnetic field intensity, the integral of magnetic field intensity along the closed path will be equal to the total current you know linked with that contour
that means that if you have the network and you change the orientation of the graph by stretching twisting or distorting its size if you keep the connectivity information intake all the different types of stretches or distort you have created with that particular circuit will always remain same because the topology of the network is same
so, in that case what will happen the current i actually entering into this dot, but this i leaving the dot right this is not there this this is not there suppose dot is here you have made the dot
so, focus, first thing that we see is sine wave, can you please show where is sine wave
just inside also the field would be the same, because parallel component electric field is always the same
so, in magnetic field is required and you are what you call and conductors which will also the what you call which can also
there is other terminology also we use, when we are constructing these 3d objects using softwares, which we call chamfer
so, with respect to kids there are few issues that approximately all parents experienced invariably, like my child is not paying attention in the classroom, the child has a problem concentrating
either it is the ten dot x x, dot x x, dot x x range in the ah, you know classical submit based systems, or it is the one ninety two, dot one sixty eight
we hear that the child is excessively talkative
now, for arduino board it is very similar
they said one of the cases i remember having read in a website or in one of their videos is they were trying to figure out, ‘how can we help emergency room patients
so now, question is in terms of phasor now i told you i have already told you in terms of phasor, it will be just z bar you may this thing right complex quantity
now, in the next session what we will do, we will use the signal flow graph concept to extend in the modelling of the state equation and the results which we will use in the state diagrams
with this, we will end this part and next we will talk about the derived types and how to use the derived types in c
so, if we prepare this statement then we will be able to find out that on what account which variable cost has gone up and which fixed cost has gone up and we will check that that this cost doesn't go up in the next quarter or the purpose of budgeting is achieved
we can use only 2 watt meter for getting the power consumption details
so, we see that the force is from left to right and the motion of the plate motion of the plate is right to left
this part is very thin, it is more like a supporting element for this cylinder
so, that will be your second mask process
some are more variable than other types of masonry
so, now we will start looking at the block rotor test of a 3 phase induction motor
this is what we said earlier also just reiterating that, that is all
as an example, for how to use this line by line processing, let us imagine that we want to copy the contents of a file input dot txt to a file output dot txt
so, you take a regular masonry structure, two story, three story masonry structure, pre compression levels are not small
so, this theorem is telling you that the fields are spatially band limited
therefore, we need a way to actually work around this particular problem
so, i will say for each of the keys, in this case, dhawan and kohli, initialize the dictionary which i have already set up not here i would have set that total is a dictionary
i am writing i 1 plus 10, suppose if outgoing current will that that is from this is a node, this is a node, right
so this is due to cut off
in particular, we want to understand: does a wave mean that a material particle moves from one place to another
so, these are knobs, you can you can change the knob, and you will be able to see the change in the frequency
the equation will be like: four times i one, then i one
and when we are fitting these polygons, whatever the curve which pass through that crossing these polygons that is what we call bezier curves
the places where the pieces meet are known as knots
2 meter wall panel on which you are working
so people live no stone unturned today to reduce power dissipation in the circuits
you are shown this, a floor plan, and this is the rectangular dual graph
so, this openness is an interesting concept which is very flexible, so that, you can, in multiple, different files also, different parts of the namespace may be specified
consider a multivariable system which is described with the help of these two differential equations
i need not connect, do not connect the auxiliary circuit at all or do not connect the auxiliary winding circuit, then automatically if i open the switch whatever i had shown, if the switch is open i am going to essentially not allow the machine to start
15 rupees per unit that is our selling cost and in this selling price your 8 rupees is the variable cost, 2 rupees is the fixed cost and 5 rupees is the profit
another is the that armature resistors resistance control method, in this method resistance actually here, it is inserted in series with the armature circuit with this is your r this is your r that resistance is inserted here and armature resistance i mean, it is your r a small r a right and this is the field current here nothing is there
the line is subjected to wind pressure 40 kg per meter square of the projected area, the radial thickness of the ice is given 1
but once you can define these fault models, they can be very efficient and the test set can be generated absolutely directly
some may, some of you may wonder maybe i am doing some magic or some cheating
so, let me go to problem 4
linear integrated circuits work linearity between input and output while digital works on 1 and 0
and that resistance is nothing but rout, the output resistance of this circuit
so, during different phases of the project, different estimates are required
we had seen that v2 plus is equal to v1plus e raise 2 plus gamma l
so, if you take the derivative with respect to it will we 4 and multiplied by c
and that will cause a problem in not covering the step coverage properly
we will continue to look at the same example and see how to refine our program and explore new ideas
so, total mechanical power developed will be 20 plus this one you have to add right h p, so 21
and remember when you are creating such content you have to include always a continue button that allows the learner to be able not get from the first unit that has been chunked to the next unit
81 angle minus 141
similarly, 3 wheelers is a vehicle, but we can designate that in terms of vehicle being the generalization and 3 wheelers and 2 wheelers are two different specialization of the vehicle
and then once cracking takes place, you need to figure out whether the steel reinforcement is now going into tension or steel reinforcement is also in compression
total quarterly sales for the month of january, february and this march are going to be there are 175,000s, right
the rest of the circuit will remain the same
yes, i wanted to give the student a hard time
if it matches the dir then again i will have to do something risky i have to take this staff pointer which is engineer pointer and forcibly cast it to a director pointer so that this whole thing now becomes a pointer to director
why it will be intact
third, we note that we are storing contents of the edx register into the location pointed to by the eax register
then, when v c this voltage goes above this level when v c goes above this level 2v cc by 3 call this comparator 1
so at the output what we will have is, we will continue having our original tones at omega 1 and omega 2 with amplitude given like this and this
if, point a is on horizontal plane in front of the vertical plane o a’ will be this o a and o a’ will be mapped at o a o o location
mostly people will say that it is a combination of both and this you have the talent you cannot be polished, you cannot be trained and unless you undergo rigorous training, your talent probably would go waste
others are loan payable
so before that it was all surface applied systems
because d6 can use at most for 8 units and these 3 tasks will suffer inheritance related inversion for at most 8 units
now, this may seem like a strange thing to do, why should it tell you because you know from the length of s what is number of character is written, but this is useful if, for instance, the disk is full
it fit a parabola in between each segment right and then that approximation will of course be better right
so, for this circuit say now the it is easier if you to start our calculation as you mean the voltage across the resistance to be v ok
so, i r i x n and this is never 90 degree right because of my drawing it shows like this but not right
so all these three things should be valid only then the self excitation process really you know can go ahead, i can also say that if originally my field resistance line itself is like this i have got the field resistance line which is if versus ifrf, which is indirectly eg, if times rf we are taking it as eg so this is the field resistance line by chance if i am driving the generator at a much lower speed
though the first dictionary entry of the term is found in the 1885 edition of merriam webster dictionary
so, here you will not be able to say millivolts, here you will be able to see degree centigrade, you see here degree centigrade
so, company should run its affairs in such a way that necessary information is available to all
so, this is my x y what should i what should this axis be
so these are the factors to be found out to be plugged so that next time your standard performance is equal to the actual performance or vice versa, your actual performance is equal to the standard performance
labor mix variance in a case, in the first case if there is no change in the standard composition of labor force and the total time spent is equal to the total standard time
so, how will this value look like
first is the number of teeth on the surface of the gear is proportional to the radius r1 and r2 of the gears, so in that case we can define r1n2 is equal to r2n1 because r1 is proportional to n1 and r2 is proportional to n2
so, i am going to call this node 1 node 2 and node 3
so, the current in this device is directly proportional to the number of electrons hole pairs that are generated, which in turn depends upon the intensity of the light that falls on the material
so, just to illustrate this is a left and right, if you just look in here this is a stack of character, which is character
so, that’s it for today
the final implementation is essentially an embedded system problem
so, this would be the type of response for the case when alpha is greater than omega naught that means the system is overdamped
so, that is actually something that is you know in our hands
the interactant must try to find out the reasons of the hurry, reasons why the feet are teetering, why the unsteadiness is there to find out more about the situation and resolve it in a satisfactory manner
so, given that these three calls are certainly resolvable
now in the edt dot sum i have already included the model for the electromagnetic transformer
now, in each such cycle i can write it like this: v dd by t, see c dv is nothing but c into v now, since this charging upto v
53 angle, 103
so, we refer to the mechanism as toe crushing, but what has happened at the serviceability state is heel cracking
so, this equation is nothing but look into that this is i infinity v s upon r is i infinity here, right
always remember, when you start the experiment, your table should be clean; when you leave the experiment your table should be clean, right
and if you put it, and try to integrate it integrate it, you will use this relationship omega is equal to 2 pi by t that means, my omega t will be is equal to 2 pi right
please understand all of those things carefully
so, in that case when you take m out it will become f by m and the elements will be 0, 1
this is especially true when we have week illumination, where we assume that the illumination intensity is smaller compared to the concentration of the majority carriers
do we know how to do this integral
now, when you are asked to find, to draw the block diagram you can simply write xs as an input to the block, within the block you will have integrator the laplace transform of the integrator or you can say the transfer function related to integrator that will be 1 by s into ys
this is definitely not a good option and one more major problem is harmonics, we definitely not looking at sinusoidal voltage or sinusoidal current, everything is non sinusoidal, so the motor can have third harmonic, fifth harmonic, seventh harmonic and so on and so fourth and which can really interfere with the proper working of the motor
we got it
so, the singularity of g is integrable
you have to multiply the voltage by something to get a current, so this has to be a conductance
initial value was given v c 0 and v c infinity
they may behave differently in terms of efficiency, you might see that one version is faster than another or one version slower than another, but this is not the same as saying that the functions change
now, cash and cash equivalents as at the beginning, net cash generated or used in operation
now, if you see the expression that is fs integration between 0 minus to infinity ft e to the minus ft dt, if you put the value of s in this, so this will become the value that is 0 minus to infinity integration, e to power minus sigma t ft into e to power omega t
so now this is the circuit we have and here are the two terminals of the capacitor and just for completeness i will connect it up like that so, what is the resistance that appears across c1
you see here this one is your metal for heater, right
now what will happen is in between the two also i will get another portion of sinusoids like this
so, if i want to let us say get a relation between the electric fields above and below, the boundary that is my objective
so, what do you want when they dissect, why do not you record it
so you are saying you basically click photos of content that you write on your diary
so in this class ah, we shall be discussing two more fault simulation algorithms, called deductive and concurrent
this is being integrated in v 2 yes, but its outside the integral sign right
then we have to lap the wafers ,we had to polish the wafers and we have to etch the wafers
so, these statics they are uncoupled system of equations; electric field has its own story, magnetic field has its own story ok
also, it produces a gate level, cell level netlist
so, now right so, impedance per phase, so z p z phase is equal to z y or z p, this is z p actually, z p is equal to z delta
so, string like aab will come before ab, because, the second position a is smaller than b
clique means maximally connected graph
this kind of thing is called what projection of this surface on to that plane
so let us say that the polarization created is p in the same direction, its e
to summarize what we have seen is that text values are important for computation, and python has the types string or str, which is a sequence of characters to denote text values
so, the question is this e r over here is it e r or e r prime is that a question it is going to be
now recall what we mentioned during our last lecture
i want to know the field somewhere outside here right that is where i want to find out the field
but this is the form that we will use to convert into a numerical solution the once i have transfer the second derivative into a first derivative ok
also there is ar n 4200, 4300 and 4400
so e inside is q over four pi epsilon zero k r square, and e outside is q over four pi epsilon zero r square, in radial direction
so, if you see in this figure, we say that current i 1 and v 1 is the overall voltage and current of the overall network, and v 2 i 2 is the output port current of the overall network
so, total purchases plus carriage on purchases, this works out as 1,41,440
25 ohm, it is 19 ohm and secondary side it is 0
is the compressive strength of the material, for a given compressive strength of the material, you can estimate what is the load that that wall can carry
the variable cost has also not proportionately come down that is the cause of concern here as i told you to keep the contribution per unit same if the level of sales is coming down cost should also proportionally come down in two cases if it has come down variances are favorable but still not in the same proportion and in the one case that is a total administrative expenses if you talk about they have increased rather than going down so this is a negative variance of the $200 has been seen here
so there is no miracles out there
so, now, we can see that person class is construct instances is constructed only once and based on that the faculty and student instances have been
so, in order to do that, there are some rules for simplification of signal flow graphs
and then if you put it in the machine you apply magnetic field and that aligns all the spins of those protons either up or down, compared to the magnetic field
where all are we enforcing this
graphically this is shown here
first 2 row you repeat
so an integrator will provide you the means to achieve zero steady state error because of an infinite gain whatever may be the value of vc error is equal to zero because vc by infinity will be zero so if you put a scalar scaling value k i then what basically happens is depending upon whether k i is greater than one or less than one gain or atteniation you will be choosing different parallels which will change the bandwidth so you have a measure of control on the speed of response so k i is one aspect then let us say instead of allowing it to instead of allowing this to go in the fashion like this at somewhere at this point i try to flatten it out then the high frequency in the high frequency of regions of the omega i have a bit more gain and this can improve my dynamics which means if you have to flatten out the curve so my integral action is here integrator, and at this point you want to wave shape it, you want to shape the gain curve like this instead of it allow, instead of allowing it to go at minus 20 db per decade, you make it 0 db per decade
so, now, this hinge mate is complete and we can check for the angle limits
so, in this case in this case, that your this this i t is there 3 henry 3 henry inductor is there and this 2 ohm and 5 ohm are will be will be in series right so; that means, that means this 2 plus 5
there are many, many, many options possible
so, these are called initial and final values of current i
if you have done that good enough right, but this is telling you that you know you have done all the hard work getting till they just go all the way and do something a little bit more accurate, you will get this
now to just remind you i am just putting it as negative
there is step load disturbance that is increase i have written here in the bracket an increase in the disturbance; that means, whenever increase in the disturbance delta p l you will take as a positive thing, right
generally, you take it is a 50 hertz system f it = 50 hertz
so once we do this kind of partitioning, floor planning, we are going for something like a divide and conquer approach
so, we have to do a balance between these different kinds of projects
we can simply represent each of the regions by a single line
with respect to your frequency how input resistance is going to change right
and also let me call this axis as x this is x this is a spatial distance this x axis time axis
now, use our compass to transfer this length
so, its a little bit like this i have some function let say that this is what grad phi dot n hat looks like and the starting and ending point is; obviously, the same because i am going on a circle ok
unconsciously, they would say it
so, we saw this kind of a program for factorial which almost directly follows a definition saying that f of 0 is 1 and f of n is n into f n minus 1
now there is something very, very interesting
this is one more reason to put all your function definitions at the beginning and only then have the statements that you want to execute
and there is a good correlation between saturation index and expansion
so this is the cost of production we have calculated now
so, when say let us just put this equation 1 we will put it on hold and we will see the comparison next look at lossy media and we will use something very simple we will use our ohm’s law we have already done that before ohm’s law is
to provide all this we need good hydraulics, we need the servovalve that i told you is like the brain of the testing machine and it can range from 5 litres to 1500 litres per minute, what does this mean
we can write that your r is equal to v upon i right; that means, v is volt i is ampere and r it is ohm
we shall see later how you can manipulate this zone representation
and if we connect rb in series at the output or 1 upon ra in shunt in the input , any one of this have to be done not both
lot of times when we go to funding agencies, they say what is new in cement and concrete
so, i will just call it e l, was first discovered in 1907, until p n junctions were invented in 49
so, there are lot of factors to be considered when we are coating a photoresist like; what is the thickness desired
so, i should say force per turn will be 2 phi p divided by 2 pi r multiplied by ia by a,right
i used to call it moss transistor but it turns out the device that we have been considering so far which operates with vgs and vds greater than 0 and current flowing from drain to source this is known as n type moss transistor or usually it is called the n mos transistor
that means the strength due to bearing is coming 52
6 micro volts right
so for that remaining other things with regard to the calculation of these variances and solving some problems with regard to the or related to the material variances i will discuss in the next class
in this experiment it is acting as a actuated device, which is connected to microcontroller to turn on and off the appliance
so, we can quickly conclude that here we have mobile phone is a landline phone and smart phone is a mobile phone and with that now, we can look at the total functionality
so, this is the line
maybe, i will have to bring out the neutral as well; very often i might have to bring out the neutral because the neutral will be normally grounded and the ground will also be connected to the body of the machine
so, when you connect a speaker and you will hear a popping sound at rate below 100 hertz below frequency of 100 hertz
so i have the workspace
bar curtailment is again allowed for as in reinforced concrete where if the expected demands are lesser than the m max, the maximum moment, then you are allowed to go in with bark curtailment
so, capacitor is a passive element design to store energy in its electric field
you would be able to evaluate security measures and apply them to various parts or various components from the hardware, operating system and the compiler and also you would be able to trade off between the performance and security
so, what we have done if you summarize what we have done so far, we have looked at the, i mean, we did the space update, we did the time update, then we looked at accuracy under what condition, not accuracy but stability, under what conditions there is a wave, appear like a wave and we find out what is called this courant stability criterion ok
so, the first thing you want to calculate is the diffusion lengths to know the diffusion lengths we need to know the diffusion coefficients
they are the people who are running the business
so after calculating you can find out 723, which is less than 94, and d by tw
so, this is one part we have discussed till now in the standard costing with regard to the material variances because material variances are very very important to be analyzed
if it is like this, then it may fail in this way, in this way, say, i can give a name that 1 2 3 4
once i measure the voltage i will get the residual emf that is generated so i will be able to plot what is my occ, so this is going to be my occ by adjusting the field rheostat right and accordingly i am going to get different points in the occ
we found that in the statute of anne though they have mentioned that there is a need to protect the rights of the creators they are also carefully worded the need to disseminate information as well
the indian concept of the thriguna and trying to making mix and match that what actually suggests what type of situation in terms of personality
use 1 and 2 as centers
so, consider the feeder circuit and voltage feeder diagram and so, this is this this we have seen figure 1 a and c right
and then at high temperature, we find that we have electrons that come from the valance band and your extrinsic semiconductor behaves like an intrinsic one
we will have to take that into account
that you can do by taking help of the oscilloscope
and the consequence therefore is that, the c++ programmers really write their own sorting programmes, they just make use of the sort as is given here
so let's just examine how that is arrived at
17 x 1014 cm3
but, for the sake of your understanding at this stage you just assume that your if this is 0, there will be your, what we call for balanced voltage source v a n plus v b n plus v c n is equal to 0 right
so, there are many situations in which while our program is running we might encounter an error
let us come to polygenic now, this is the term which is used for traits whose phenotype is influenced by more than one gene
like, no this, draw a line like that
in the operating point case this vs will be 0 and vgs will be vgs 0 and vds will be vds 0 and there will be a voltage drop id 0 rl across this
so, if we could come back to our written slides
if it is a liability, it will be shown as a deferred tax liability
so, as you can see in the process of marking, these squares, sometimes we mark the square twice and we have to have a systematic way of making sure that we do this correctly and do not get into a loop
now, suppose i have forcefully cast it
so, in the top view, this bottom one is invisible and this ab, bc, cd, ea are full lines in top view
if x is the address of a, then star x is actually a
98 into 10 to the power 4 by a dash is 2672 so after calculating the value is coming 44
so, this provision brings out the distinction between the capacity of an inventor and the capacity of an applicant
so after the edge comes, a minimum amount of t hold time must be provided and only after that the logic calculations
now a is connected to the segment of split ring ‘a’ small a and b is connected to the segment or split ring portion small b,right
negative feedback seems bad positive good, but in electronics positive feedback means run away or oscillation and negative feedback means stability; stability, all right
so you are going to have very very minimum amount of flux under short circuit condition and that is the reason so i have short circuited but, i am getting the rated current only beyond if rated
therefore 1 upon ceq when capacitors are in series, it is 1 upon c 1 plus 1 upon c 2 plus 1 upon c 3 plus 1 upon c n right
so once here i have drawn the stick diagram, it is rather straight forward to convert the stick diagram into this layout
so, what is the property of a perfect metal
silicon dioxide will get etched without affecting silicon
now, in this case here it will be 2 into 3 that is equal to 6 volt right, now this is 8 volt
now, for mobile charge carrier is equal to the in mobile ions so; that means, our charge neutrality will be maintained correct
we have seen this example and we have also seen how to fabricate gas sensor using mems technology
whereas for motor we will use left hand rule
we will be giving you some assignments at the end of the week which you have to do on your company
051 kilowatt hour
r and t
in mysub, there will be several instructions, it will execute
so, one reason could be that labor cost variance has become negative or adverse
in that the a’ b’ smaller than a b whereas, a b is the true length giving us complete information on a b
so, this is below the intrinsic fermi level and it is minus 0
for example all the darker cache sets like these over here have a higher execution time indicating that the spy process has incurred a lot of cache misses
so any solution that you think of implement or even are prototyping to put together will have some kind of flaw, some kind of challenge and that is the conflict even if you don’t have a solution
and it turns out that there are two different classes of problem that we have to worry about ok
in fact now if you look at the theoretical side of these things what different kind of model suggest is that whenever anybody in the world has life challenging situations
in today's lecture we will mainly cover about line projections
so, i i will giving you the final solution
for the cells to attach you have to have reasonable amount of adhering side and a thin film of water around it
in given light conditions pupils will either dilate or contract as our attitudes and as our moods change
now this will load the circuit schematic with the net list and now run to perform the simulation
so the delay will be hundred plus two hundred three hundred
wish you all the best for your examination and beyond that to become a very efficient, proficient and prolific programmer in c++
so, it is like if i am writing a assign b, then what i am interested in b is its value of the b
but notice that because i am going along the counter, along counter clockwise the path
now, what do we have to do
in the first we will consider the combination of series resistor, resistors and then we will see the parallel one, right
first you do a vertical partition, then a horizontal, then vertical, and this iteratively
75 right divided by 6 so doing this i can find out the value of rd as 182
if it is diameter is d, so area will be pi by 4 d square
so, this ex or would then map specific input to something which is totally different and similarly anything which is stored over here that same secret is ex or back to obtain the corresponding output
so, for our analysis what we will do
so, this is that your what you call the r c circuit, ah that your what you call that your ah initially you have studied the source free, now you are studying that your circuit is involved with sources right
159 z p upon a is a constant, z p upon your i mean i have rate taken this one z p upon 2 pi a it is a constant
the interface is very simple, we shall be seeing this kind of interfacing experiments later
so, that is where you have the first contributory factor we designate ductility with the factor mu, displacement ductility is what we are basically referring to where this displacement ductility of the structure is nothing but because it is now going on almost horizontal the ratio of delta u to delta y
so it may be possible we have to find out the reasons that why the extra quantity of 1,500 units has been used
if we take an example of a concrete element or concrete product, ideally we should look at it from cradle to grave but this always very different because there are many different ways concrete can be used many different ways, cement can be used and to track and to trace all the details is not that easy
so, it will be minus v, then you moving clockwise so, it will encounter plus terminal here, for r 1 and plus terminal here for r 2
so, encountering plus terminal past so, it is your plus v 3, then it is when your moving like this clock wise encountering minus terminal first so, minus v 2 is equal to 0
in the outer shell, 2 in the s and then 2 in the p which forms 4 sp 3 hybrid orbitals, which gives you 4 electrons
at temperature equal to 0 kelvin and a temperature is very close you going to have negligible number of electrons coming from the valence band
so the condition for the output changing will be will be l a union, l b
the invisible g, which has been, which has come here through inheritance and h, all this four functions would be available to be inherited by any class that specialises from the class d
so, if we are winding a rope or thread around a cone sorting all the way from apex to base, the geometric curve we get is called conical helix
so that is what we call broadband matching
so, ah in the class room exercise i cannot teach you that optimality and other thing but i will tell you at the end of all this thing that how one can do a optimal thing
this clock period will be decided not only by the combination circuit delay, but also some characteristics of this flip flop, this set up and hold times
size of a is less than size of b, less than size of c
this is going to be the phase voltage, okay
so, from today whenever you have a bath you will remember bessel functions right, because they are everywhere in nature wherever there is a 2 d kind of a wave problem
so, that is telling me the source point right
after that, construct a rectangular one and rotate it
to avoid using hidden lines, choose the most descriptive viewpoint
and 2 other components at omega 1 omega 2 and omega 2 omega one with amplitude given by these values, okay
i will be importing one a bolt and a nut
so, here the design is going to be as per 1905 which is the code for unreinforced masonry as a structural solution
anything (refer time: 34:16)
so do you have your subject textbooks or your specialisation textbooks as softcopies available to you
once we reach mosfet process flow and if you still have any question, you can ask me or ask the ta
independent directors are supposed to also maintain the standard of conduct
so that we will get from bottom also, one line goes in that way
now when i am actually having you know some of the domains aligning further and further, it is traversing this portion of the curve, right
so, i'm looking at a pier that is sitting between openings
so, as you see in the photograph here, you can see that axial compression is being applied using the actuator at the top
so, now we further dissected it and if you dissect it you will find out here is that as i told you in the previous class also the cost is a function of price and quantity
so, i1 minus i 2 is showing, j omega l 1 this will be j omega m i 2 right
order delta order delta
so, now, this is an airtight chamber and if i now move this pointer you see its very difficult to move the pointer and it settles down very quickly if i can make it airtight it does not oscillate
so, that means, your; to apply the superposition 2 things must kept in our mind right
so, at and this this is the here what you call this is the equivalent circuit and ceq is equal to c 1 plus c 2 plus c 3 up to plus c n right
now, next is induced emf very simple thing suppose you take flux is sinusoidal one
so, o' c' we draw it
so, let us take one more example to understand these isometric views
voltmeter reading will be same as the voltage that appears across the voltmeter which is v 2 and this is our no ok so, this is voltmeter reading
okay, here is the tech question to you supra, he is a tech guy i know in this team
this is a differential amplifier
u 2 1
now again if you recall basic electrical circuits, the way you evaluate time constants in a first order system is by looking at the resistance that appears across a capacitor
what kind of a polynomial can i fit with two points
so, one additional variance we calculate here which is called as litv but other variances are largely same as compared to the or means if you compare these with the material variances you are simply replacing in the labor variances the word labor or the word material with the labor here and others are same
now, in practice the gears also have inertia and friction between the coupled gear teeth and that often cannot be neglected
and then you need to check whether the tension controlled criterion is correct or not
if you keep telling yourself that i am depressed, mind is very mind need just mind just needs categorizations
therefore, depending on the value of the resistance that we want to measure we should alter the markings of this scale ok
so because you are successively computing means and medians, medians than means, again median, again mean
but a problem could occur
means that the value of i mean the way i implement the boundary condition lets say this part of the boundary depends on only the local values of the field; it does not depend on anything else ok, the word itself there is local abc
so, let us go in to see what that the new mathematical technique is and that is the technique of greens functions ok
so, not saying again and again; it is understandable to you , right
now, if you look at a transistor, say from a top view, a mos transistor, there is a region which is the channel
when the coca cola came to the market and coca cola offered the price that parley's, you will not be able to fight the competition with us
so, i do not want to get into the harmonic elimination, but generally this kind of pitch is known as short pitching
you will simply take the denominator and equate it to 0 and you try to find out the roots of this particular expression
the third property which the bell lapadula model defines is the ds property which stands for discretionary access control, so what it say is that even though you have a mandatory access control or a mac layer defined, nevertheless you should still have a discretionary access control mechanism in your system, essentially the mac rules overwrite the discretionary access control policies, a user cannot give away data to unauthorised persons
in third year it is 75 minus the second year's depreciation, that is 22,500 and so we'll get a further reduced value
38 let us express it as a percentage
suppose at this point it is switches off, so 4 t u t minus 4 t u t minus 3, right
so, our smiles as well as laughter the presence and absence of these also matter in order to communicate our emotions and personality types
that magnetizing current is really really small because of the permeability of the iron being so high
whereas for the hard real time and sporadic task, minimization of the response time is not the objective
we will
but unfortunately here there are no see if it is an inductor, inductor being a state or energy storing variable component the current is a state variable and then it will show you the branch current of that
so we will just write it down, so it is 1 by r
so, you have both of them over here, this current in turn is going to produce a scattered field
so, managers would essentially fight with each other because they want to prove that they are better than others
there is no singularity in g, but look at g prime g on both sides it is continuous, but look at the derivative of g on the left hand side and the derivative of g on the right hand side; the discontinuity is in the derivative right which we sort of saw in this relation, the derivative was discontinuous ok
so if we have quantitative estimates of these diffusion coefficient, chloride threshold, cover depth and chloride at the concrete surface, we can actually estimate the service life
if the cost of the product is going up beyond our control, we will have to look first of all is the cost prime cost at the acceptable level or the works cost is more i think it is not at the acceptable level
this is also possible once you get mastery over how to think in terms of whys and conflicts
they would write a note on the inventory and will also give the method which they are using for inventory valuation and that will give you more insights into valuation of inventory i hope you have liked the sessions namaste danawha so, i'm going to be
it may be possible that you want to sell in this coming quarter 3,000 units of the product
so the force experienced by a conductor c carrying 1 ampere of current per unit length
if there is no value v then we just return the easy cases are when we do not find we are the current thing
so, next one, here what is that you can measure capacitor, you can measure diode
so when the rotor winding is looking at stator flux or the air gap flux which is the resultant of the original revolving magnetic fields flux created by the rotor plus whatever is the new flux created by the armature current
so, that is why one of the very famous authors’ comments that private inheritance means nothing during software design, because during the design time you just know the isa hierarchy is you do not know the internals of the implementation
that is the reason why i couldn’t care less in terms of whatever is the phase shift that may exist between ic and v1, it is hardly anything
but we stopped at that magnetic field, we did not go beyond that, that that may also give rise to further an, an, an additional electrical field
now if the malloc request was large enough so that even the top chunk does not have sufficient memory to satisfy that particular malloc request then the os gets invoked and i knew heap segment gets allocated, so this is done using the brk in maps or the sbrk system calls
if the variances are within the threshold level of 10% or 50,000 for example, then we are well within the range
and then we have grown oxide we have grown oxide using using thermal oxidation and this was done at 1200 degree centigrade using wet oxidation technique or dry oxidation technique, right
so, it is 10 by root 2 ampere 5 by root 2 ampere and 10 by root 2 ampere
so, a better way of implementing the same short would be that instead of having one single connection between the inner and the outer conductor, we might actually have a throughout connection, what i mean is, say this is my inner conductor and this is my outer conductor and say this is the other end which is shorted
but here we have the point of caution is that we have to see the relationship between the buyer and supply that should not be at the stake
so, as a as a hint if i have alpha in my hand; that means, if supposing i fix alpha then i only need to fix one of the two either delta t or delta x; because they are related
so, c1 r1 in parallel then you have current source i1 which is now connected to v1, between v1 and v2 you have the resistance that is 1 by r2
now, again, master budget i told you operating budget and financial budget
in this example, it is so that identified as trail lines of level zero which we store temporarily for further processing
similarly you compute h same way
so what this will do is it will return a new string which is of length n with s centered in it
now, let us move on, so what will happen in c++
you see that from this point, we have got the analog input into this a1 pin
so, as you would expect after executing these four statements, because of this update succeeding the value of z is copied into the list that position 2 and so we get the value 8 instead of the value 12 that we started with
we are using the dcdc power supply, and through dcdc power supply we have already applied plus minus 15 volts as bias voltage
so, what can i do, this move it to the right hand side i can do something like that, but if i move it to the right hand side i no longer have a e term to go along with k naught squared
there are various ways of implementing a matching network and we can use the smith chart that is the zy smith chart to know the correct values of the elements that are required for implementing a matching network
it is for example, an atom and the nucleus and the electrons or model has the mass right
they may also be produced by face
in this volume i divide this volume into very small rectangular boxes very, very small i am making into two dimensions
9 into 10 to the power 4 which is greater than the required iz that is 68807 into 10 to the power 4 so we are providing the section such that its iz is 70490 and our required iz was 68807 so the section is okay from the deflection point of view moment carrying capacity of the beam of ishb 450 section is we can find out that is 2030
now, some exercise you will do at least 10 problems i am giving you
so, it is invoked after all the pages have been added and essentially it could verify that the signature matches that of the owner signature
and, then i applied some theorems of vector calculus which converted a volume integral into a surface integral that is how the surface s and s infinity came into picture
so, it should be 0 up to this point of time and then it will finally, reach some value here which is given by this, so this is theta final
in lifo method, it will be assumed that the latest units are already issued and older units will be there in the stock
i indicate it by joint shading of yellow and green and in particular because both of them were originally reached from the starting point
so, like this you can repeat it for various values of r m and you will get a set of equations for every f of r m on the right hand side you get a set of equations
however, the non linear analysis will tell you that peer one is actually going to fail at a significantly lower level of lateral force because it is decompressed
but there are the companies like videocon, onida whose products has less acceptability in the market these days less acceptability in the market these days
so, you can write the kvl equation for this loop
so, that is why that approximate formula is used for distribution system right
this are valid wave equation for wave travelling to the left or travelling to the right
you process the gates first
so, once again this has not been filled correctly left to right, top to bottom and therefore, this is not a heap
i do not want to change the armature resistance it is inherently whatever is available, i am not really changing that and i am giving rated voltage
so, we know that it is minus 1 by rf into v1, one v two2, v3… three whatever voltages right or you can convert your shall weyou can go back and look at the summing amplifier, you can see the’s output voltage formula correct
here it is high voltage side just this is in this side your making primary side
anybody who has worked with concrete and mortar know if you want to look at flowability mortar is much more controllable as far as flowability is concerned than concrete because in mortar you rarely have the problems of bleeding and segregation
so, it is a kind of conversion from straight lines to circles
this will be executed by a team of people
that was exactly my variable in the problem
you were presented with part of the information and depending on how well acquainted you are with the facial features okay, you would have identified
we need to change our analysis, the task scheduling analysis, and we need to have new algorithms to be able to share resources
so, that keys can be arranged in that to lock the objects in one directional thing, we use this kind of objects
and just the reverse in this case where modulus of s11 is lesser than 1 then it means the origin point is lies in the stable region and since origin point is lies in the stable region and the origin itself is outside the output stability circle hence all points inside the output stability circle must be must corresponds to potentially unstable state
there are various goals while we design an active circuit like an amplifier
the 1st thing to do is to start the receiver and we need to ensure that the cache is shared and as we have seen earlier in this video the processor 0 and the processor 4 are essentially sharing the same cpu core thus we need to ensure that both these processors the receiver and the server are executing on exactly this core, so we can do this by the taskset command taskset c 0
so, tax expense is categorized as current deferred
so, suitably we are acknowledging and if there are any omissions in terms of acknowledgement, please excuse us
so, we have to make sure that there is no shortage of the material in the plant or at the say production unit level and if it is possible to run the show without keeping the large amount of inventory, maybe of the raw material or of the finished products, then it is always better because it reduces the overall cost of production because inventory in any way has the cost, it increases the cost of production and if the cost of production goes up, finally the selling price will increase and the product remains less competitive in the market
human assets are important but not part of balance sheet
like in sub instruction we are saying r1 r2
so, maybe to make it more clear, let us see some intermediate positions say here which is 135 degree ok
so, this is to define the static data member
first is the current input current inside the op amp is there is no current, because it cannot draw any current input to the op amp draws no current
so what should i do
so we shall see all this things later in the next lectures
this position must be undone
so, what we have to do here is now we will have to calculate now the third variance and the third variance is if you talk about the third variance, the third variance comes up as litv, labor idle time variance because that should be calculated separately just to find out that how much was the abnormal idle time which is not because of the shortage or because of the any sort of the inefficiency of the labor and for that we have to find out is the formula is the formula was idle time 100 hours into the this rate is standard rate that is 2
a periodic task as the name says, the tasks recur according to a timer
if there are no dependencies, it must have nothing to its left and nothing below and there is only one such point namely (0, 0)
this two cancels, this two cancels, and you end up getting two l cubed
in our case, we think of our amplifiers as being quiescent or being idle when you apply no signal and that's where we calculate the operating point and then when we apply the signal we treat the signal as an increment
these things are very simple but since this is a very first problem which we are discussing i am just going slow
so, one has to construct a normal, then show this length
tracking wildlife to gain information about their lifestyle, there could be many other information we can gather
so i am accepting this
so, bc is this in this much 11500 volt and ac you are what you call you have taken 2300 volt
what is meant by associate
again look at the resemblance between their faces
so, ohms law will say that v 0 is equal to 4 into i 0
here also huge competition is there, but ah we will see that ah we will think of all this things i have thought over that the problem will be given in such a fashion such that you can do it quickly right without ah calculating too much right, but these are the basic thing
that is the thing if we are looking from this side one is a’ other one is a
so, let us do that step by step, ok
and so, you can see that in my map as well
so, when you go to solve try to solve this problem in a simulation you have to end the simulation boundary somewhere right
so, it is a wrap around that i want
what we want to do is, we want to call gcd with n and m minus n instead we will call gcd with the maximum value of n and the difference as a first argument and the minimum value of n and the difference
in the third part porosity and the fourth part which is very short will be a case study to show how we can bring all these techniques together to look at phase assemblages in cement paste
this position of hands indicates superiority, confidence and power
but, we found out that things could be a lot more interesting, if we added a small amount of dopants to the semiconductors
5 this is due to dead load and also wind load is acting and as the wind speed is 50 meter so we can find out wind pressure wind pressure will be calculated as 0
in the earlier lecture we had looked at return to libc attack where the attacker overflows a buffer present in the stack and replaces the return address with one specific function in the libc library
so, that is why the power is positive; that means, this element actually is absorbing the electrical power so; that means, when i is leaving the plus terminal or entering into the plus terminal right
i am sending on, it is working
now you have value of function at zero at both sides, those both will cancel out
this is a very simplified design flow
96 milli amperes, so that is nearly 1011 orders of magnitude or 1010 orders of magnitude higher than the reverse saturation current
so, that is why we are saying as many transistors including fet's resistors
now, the economic history as has been brought in is really very interesting
ugc now requests universities and affiliated colleges to provide ipr as elective course
i cannot see one single ten micron pore in that
once again we can draw an energy versus bond length diagram for lithium
so, 50% of that is going to be how much
what is a electromagnet
the dc current is definitely having 0 frequency, it is not a rotating phasor, it is not a rotating phasor but i am looking at it from the viewpoint of the revolving magnetic field, that is the reason i am able to specify that damp if as you know a vector, phasor, a rotating vector
017 kilowatt right because copper loss varying with the load
so the revenues generated from where the money is coming and then we relate it with the expenses
other than videos only, camtasia is there only for videos
so, nonverbal messages tell us how to interpret verbal messages and they may vary considerably across cultures
then forehead and eyebrows are wrinkled and pull towards the center of the face and lips are also is stretched
so, if this was actually a t is equal to 0, switch was just closed at t is equal to 0, 0 plus say right
now, and in this case for dependent voltage source this actually leaving the plus terminal so, p 2 will be negative power supplied and p 2 will be is equal to your, this is minus sign power supplied
and durability sort of gets mentioned but there is not much emphasis
so what you do here is that, just like your timing analysis, whatever you had seen earlier, your gate or wide delays are pre characterized
the screen now, what i told you is i have a boat i have some material right
and ah, and when it will be in parallel that, when we will try to find out in between one and two are norton, because at that time this is open, this is also open and this is also we have to find out between 1 and 2
so let's do that properly
if you do not need to adjust it manually, it can automatically adjust
so, my driver was driving all of a sudden on the long road; all of a sudden, there was lightning stroke on the right side of the road; my driver actually; brake the car
what else is not correct about it
the moment they increase the price, you always have to forecast that your demands are going to, your sales are going to go down in this market
so, let us have a look at, so supposing i at some time instant time i put the electric field equal to 0 let us say at t is equal to 0
so in this second part of the lecture, first we talked about some of the design style specific issues in placement
so, if it is a situation and if we have already borrowed more than the sanction limit, the limit of the working capital by the bank, so will be in a great trouble
so, this is just this is the only complication that appears at the boundary points
so these are the important principles we have tried to compare various global models
if you wanted to minimize if you want to minimize high values of g 0, simplest fix is
so, in short in this problem what is given to you, what all do you think is given to you in a problem like this microwave problem
so, surface area right
what about the potential at the at this point
but so far if you look at the discussion that we have never mentioned anything with priority
in other words, we should be able to change one implementation to another one such that the functions behave the same way and the outside user has no idea which implementation is used
so, we used very simple things, we use maxwell’s equations and all four of them were used right
so, before we go into surface and the difference between surface and volume, i want to take a quick aside, one sec, about surface integral equations in the presence of pecs
so, i will have basically the characteristics somewhat like this, for the field flux control; and if i look at it this field flux decreasing direction
we have learned how to simulate the rectifier capacitor filter circuit
so, this is the essential scheme in this measurement, ok
for this, we can as we can guess that this fin casing is supposed to be concentric with this piston, and we will we will click on the on mate
since this is an input change the output voltage will change by vo equals to vos in to gain this is nothing, but vos is 3
so, 22 square by 4 into 9 so, 13
so who would be, the administration team itself would be uploading that or creating that content
we can trace the red lines to go up to t, we can trace the green lines to go up to s
so, that gave me a condition for u prime, basically that is what i wanted and that u prime is what i substituted over here and that gives me a non zero right hand side right
so, plus is just the simple operator which takes two strings and sticks them side by side
a sigma the new variable in place of s
so now if you try to find out that what is this variance total if you take this variance and if you apply the test here for the material cost variance you apply the test here for example mcb is equal mpb plus mub
so, v 1 then plus v 2 , v 2 is this one , 76
just see that when i making it hope it is matching with this your this thing just hold on let me have a look this one this one r 1, r 2, r 3 ok
so, your activity has come down by 1 lakh
this bearing might be initially turned in that direction
so, that is why it is ah your what you call equation directly written like this and v 1 infinity minus 62
the more difficult things happen when there is some medium some aircraft or whatever is there right
so, mind it is a very important condition
it could also be if you have reinforced concrete structures or even steel structures, prescriptions are you look at the first yield, the force at which the first element starts yielding in the structure
so wire capacitance will be the capacitance of a basic square into l by n
but now we have introduce the third statement also that has become the statutory statement or compulsory statement which is called as cash flow statement
so, we have at (5, 10) the top right corner
so, if my somebody if in my first degree relative or second degree relative has had depressive, my risk will go up to 18 percent, 20 percent whatever understand
so, you see that from say from here to here, so let us consider the move the time from 90 degree to 180 degree, you see these downward flux it has it is concentrated here ok
so, we have function f which reads an x from outside and tries to print it
socially sanctioned polite touch behaviors help us to initiate interaction with others, help us to overcome our hesitations and at the same time it shows us that we are included in our team and that we are respected by others
because you see, ah mean you are doing testing
you can see that the lifetime of an object continues to be same only with the exception that lifetime of the base object will start before the lifetime of the derived object can actually start
it could be a one in three mortar, one in four mortar, proportion one in five, one in six but the big challenge that we have today is keeping the motor strength lower than the unit strength
so, it was open for a long time so initial current that i 0 will be 100 divided by 2 plus 3 that is 20 ampere that is the initial current that is flowing to the inductor right and that i x 0 at it will be 0
instead we will do huygens principle ok
this current source disappears
so, this is in vacuum and i move it in either direction, then this will start to oscillate
i hope you remember that dividend first of all is financing so tax thereon is also financing
so, one aspect what we have considered is the lab is divided into 2 parts
the in motion study, in the you know bottom pane, we have this motor option
94 kilowatt, but here if you look it is 26
in that case, i have silicon reacting with water vapor
you are expected to understand each and every part of it that is understand the terminology and then put it in the proper sequence based on the format
it has got two usb ports; this is for the network, these are audio and video
so, in a integral equation and i have to do fourier transform to look at pulse distortion
so, you have constructed the printer and put it here
what is it that we need to make vo equal to 0
now, you have applied kcl now you have to put the value of i 1, i 2 and i 3
5 newton per meter right and factored load normal to roof thus we can calculate as 1
so, every time i am not writing that your v t and v t
so, the flow of because there were many modules over here we started with, what do the first thing that we did
this one is unity power factor as 100 kva transfer half load the half into 100 into 1000 into 1, so 50 10 to the power 3 watt right
this movable part is still stationary because of a spring that is attaching it to a frame and let us say maybe i have this distance to be x 1, okay
you have to tell a young girl of 20, she has a problem
what edison did was all dc generation, he made a small power system within you know new york city and he showed that you know dc transmission could be done
these are the points from where clock signals are taken
for pmmc instrument the scale is linear or uniform, because theta is proportional to i
cross section dimensions can be square or rectangular and it is prescribed that whenever it is at the corner, these have to be square in cross sectional dimensions can be square or rectangular and it is prescribed that whenever it is at the corner these have to be square in cross section and at least 200 m m or 230 m m one brick thick cross sections at the corners whereas in other locations they can be 100 m by 100 m or 114 by 115 by 230
now let’s see that there is some voltage vt that is 10 sin t which is shown in this figure
some of them are based on some particular data structures, like rectangular dual graph, then hierarchical tree, simulated annealing is a very, you can say, ah, common method which gives very good results, and there are some other variations
right so, all the power is not i mean the optimal power is not dumped into the whatever load you want some of its gets reflected back which is undesirable right
let me copy over this
few would be balance sheet assets
so as we mentioned earlier the long distance power transmission conductors in multiples of three, that is we have three phase three wire system so are used
and then the institutions like marriage and clan and kinship and all,but the possibility of transgressing the boundaries always there for anybody
all these domains actually have certain amount of role to play when it comes through the final delivery and we would just like to make it concise by picking up important principals from each of these domains and what is boils down to is these four important aspects
so, this is at t equals or this angle at the angle of 0 degree, t equal to 0 degree, so this is 0 degree
then we use smart dimension, from here to here it supposed to be 8 mm
there are classes 1 to 31 and class 99
like here, we are defining a criticality factor, say alpha i for every sink, s i
now, see i will be sending an on message, it seems to have some issue
then it is called as a stock holding period
now the difference between the two complex powers is absorbed by the line impedance that means the power supplied by the source minus the power absorbed by the load
so as a matter of convention, this a, a, t will record the arrival time at the output side of node v
so, we can include the numbers from mu e and mu h
so, what will i have over here i will have e n minus m and this what will be the summation
that is 66,100
you all heard in your eleventh, twelfth period, in particular in connection with both model, at any radiation radiates and therefore in bohr's model, and atom would be unstable if that charge moving in the orbit radiated because it accelerating
this cancels four pi cancels and this comes out to be q over epsilon zero
numerical quadrature is a way of implementing this integral, but that is not gone help you this integration is not challenging
so, if i know the projections how to get that inverse problem one or if i know these angles and true lengths, how can i get this a' b', these are the questions what we will ask
now, when i have this iron bar inside this, it will again be magnetized and if the right side is north then here also this should be north
so, to study the work the study the working of peak detector, that is our aim right
so, total with key dhawan is 0, total with key kohli is 0
so, we are starting with the revenue
so, at the first instance you will consider it as a non planar
because, when t tends to infinity your i told you, when t tends to infinity, this part term will vanish right, so that means transient will vanish only left out portion will be that is steady state
e is the electric field, which is nothing but the voltage v/l
now percentage of steel in the vertical direction row is 78
so unless you have this, you cannot do this right because, ah, someone has to tell you that this net has to have a maximum delay of, say, five minutes
so, these are the required number of parameters for calling the respective candidate functions
so you even very careful, very very obedient, very very disciplined with these companies but says these companies have the good reputation, good standing in the market
there are quite a few, as i said, the code does not require you to do a rigorous design, go through a rigorous design procedure to arrive at the dimensioning of the tie elements
value of n will be
we had two inputs, a and b because we got the favorable variance which was the material cost variance
the material is said to be saturated, thus by the saturations flux density that means, this you are increasing
what are the factors on which the current depends on
so, if you are reading a file line by line then we may want to know when the file has ended
if you have something that you can identify as the input port, then the resistance looking into that is the input resistance and something that is identified as the output port, resistance looking into that is the output resistance
again problem here would be sir, it might be accepted by the teacher or might not be accepted by the teacher
we note that the frame pointer present in the stack has been overwritten but not the return address
so, what this means is, apply square of 5, and then, square of that; so, do square twice
from top view this circle again in the isometric view when we are looking at 30 degrees, again that will be a parallel ellipse one has to construct at a height height is 30
so, this omega d is nothing but damping frequency and omega not is the undamped natural frequency
8 to 1
now, i can apply potential difference or voltage; voltage between drain and source
so, we are not actually going to implement this in this course, but i just want to give you the high level idea
so, in that case what will happen this is square actually this is square right
we adjusted in the cost sheet the stock of raw material and the stock of wip work in process
that is why i choose my e x to be discretized over there and not somewhere else
therefore, if work done is non zero in going around a closed path, a curl is non zero
development flexibility represents the degree of flexibility that exists when implementing the project
3 volt, your step size will be much smaller
now demonstration of this picture which we can very clearly see there is a lot of bulging of the concrete over here, there is you know, concrete is bulged there because of the expansive forces by the steel inside, okay
you see, some signal can change state at a rate which is at most equal to the clock frequency, because it is the clock, the edges of the clock, that defines the various events in a circuits
as i mentioned earlier it is not just for mechanical and aerospace engineering, even for a civil engineering and construction drawing plays an important role
so, second largest contributor to the total cost of production is the labor
but when i say this, there is a small percentage which has a diagnosable attention deficit hyperactivity, very destructive, very fidgety; especially impulsivity they can hate, they become very aggressive
it will work even without this red line, this common ground connection ok
the derived will also have different data members, base will have different methods, derived will also have different methods
so, 100 that is your into 1000 into 0
so, it will be q l 4 minus q c 4
now the problem is we cannot have rl like this
so, as switch was closed for a long time that means, to this and this 100 volt dc source is there, this is close; that means, this capacitor will act as an open circuit right
now i asked this question how much does it cost microsoft to come up with a first copy of windows say windows 7, it will be a few million dollars because you look at their r&d their investment their staff salaries a whole lot of things would have gone into creating the first copy of windows 7
either this pair of verities that may correspond to an individual net or a composite net
now even this absolute figure doesn't tell you about what is relatively relative change, relative increase or decrease
and i am going to have the other current as the inductor, so i should show may be my inductive current somewhat like this and drawing all big, big things really the currents are very very small but never the less i am just showing it for the sake of it
now, there is an alternate method also for finding the step response of either rc or rl because it is applicable to both of the types of circuits
any guesses why they are going directly to e from a and phi, why i am a going to e
global routing says for the more complex problem, in the chips, where there are many modules or blocks, there are lot of set up pins to interconnect
okay, thank you
next, once you know p 0 value, you can evaluate the p 0 value, you can evaluate the area product ap and for this you you need to assume a switching frequency and switching frequency is a designer choice depending upon what devices that you are going to use how fast the mosfets are going to be you may want to switch at 20 kilohertzars or 100 kler
so, thus the operation of a low pass filter can be verified
now, mathematically it can be expressed as; delta t we represent delta t your what you call that unit impulse function right
so, in this case what will happen the by this method
now, since i is equal to i 1 right therefore, you put here 6 i 2 minus 2 i 1 minus 3 i 1 is equal to 0; that means, i 2 is equal to 5 upon 6 i 1; now from equation 3 and equation 5 right
so, this ram is always enabled
if you solve equation; 2 and 3 you will get t is equal to 1250 kg and at the same time if you solve x 1 here i have written here x 1 is coming minus 125 meter
so, this side; that means, current equal to 0 can be marked as resistance equal to infinite
so, somewhere at point c draw a line name it cc prime
and as we as we know the various value of theta or this or as this distance from the input changes, the value try to find out the value of gamma in using the expression for exponential paper that we just derivedé the gamma in value can be written as like this and then on simplification we see it like this
first is a simple add instruction, well here as an example i have shown three registers r 0, r1, r2, but you can have any registers here not necessarily only r0, r1, r2
so, let us get the purpose
when you come to design, now you have your project managers also who will brief you about the budget and time
remember now i am doing it over a cube which is centred at the origin, like the previous example
at 9,000 70,000, at 7,000 it should be 70,000 but here this is very very very alarming situation that the fixed cost has also increased by 300 dollars which is a very very serious issue the fixed cost cannot be allowed to increase for a given level of activity rather than remaining static it has gone up by 300 dollars which is a very serious cause of concern in case of the variable cost we can accept that maybe the cost of material has gone up during the period of the period of the actual performance, maybe at the time of the preparing the budget that was a different price but actually while purchasing from the market the price of the material has gone up or maybe because of some wastages of the material the cost has gone up but in case of the fixed cost this cost should not increase fixed cost should not increase that should remain the same normally it doesn't change it changes per unit but the total cost remains the same so in this case we have found a very serious problem that your fixed cost has also gone up by $300 and that is the reason that your operating income, final operating income has been affected negatively that operating income expected at the 7,000 units of the output and sales was $5,600 and in this case means it was not operating income but you can say it is operating loss after subtracting we had a positive contribution we were expecting a positive contribution of 64,400 and subtracting from the contribution the fixed cost to the tune of $70,000 the loss operating loss expected was $5,600 but since the variable cost has also gone up in the actual performance fixed cost has also gone up in the actual performance so your operating loss has gone up by the same amount of 7 9 970 so it is 560 plus 5907 it is the total loss is equal to 11,570
of course, today in our country, reinforced concrete design and steel design have migrated to limit state methods, but masonry continues to be operated under the working stress method
so, this can work in ac and dc supply
so, say for example, now let us draw the lines
now, if capacitors are connected in parallel right it will be your what you call when they are connected in parallel it will be like same manner when you calculate resistors in series right
9 fuatn by gamma m1 so if i put the value avg as 1440 and atn as 120 then i can find out the value as 224
cross n a plus n b, because i have discretized a into n a elements b into n b elements, so i get the bigger matrix and i solved out
and we know that for a vgs 2 volts, the current increases and saturates to 50 microamperors
so, this point let us call a, somewhere in the 3 dimensions
now, this is caused by using different muscles in the forehead
we have also learn how to sustain each other and give raise to ah, ah, disturbance that can radiated, that that can propagate and that is called radiation
so the way to go about it is that at the time of manufacture of this puf, the manufacturer would create a database for challenges and the corresponding responses, so this database over here is known as the crp database and it would be stored in the server
this has an electric field
if curl of d was zero and it was known, it becomes like a problem of calculating electric field
so, what will the bi equations look like
this is an extra minus
the current is flowing here from drain to source and the fixed current source is there and to make the comparison we tie these two currents to the same node
so, suppose this is a and this is b and current flowing to these the phase a is i a and the voltage is actually it looks the voltage from here to here is your what you call , it is a your, c know it is connected we will see in the , in yournext diagrams , right
and if it is going to intersect the horizontal plane we call that one as ht point
so, that the there is no confusion between lower case a and upper case a ok
on the other hand, if you understand mid frequency methods, it is much easier for you to understand the other methods because they are simpler version right
the diagram below shows a good partitions where you can see the three partitions in different shades, where you see that the sizes of this partition are approximately equal in size fifteen, sixteen and seventeen and also you look at the number of interconnection words between the partitions
so, let us sort of visualize this a little bit better
and the higher priority tasks are the task 1 to i minus 1 and how many times will they occur before the eis period
and since one approach would be for each configuration of wall to draw the pm interaction diagrams, which is not available to you or if you want to do that, you are welcome to do that but you are dealing with several walls in a building
so, what we will do, what is different now in the case of the scattered field formulation is we will write two different weak forms, one for each region, that is how we will break it up and by the way this total field and scattered field formulation, this is even common to other methods in the electromagnetics
so, for in sort of high school when i was any one said plane wave, what would you do you said e to the j k x minus omega t
the further questions are asked
the second half of this presentation i would like to focus on the behavioral aspects of confined masonry construction, particularly under the action of lateral forces
at the same time we have to admit that our lack of comfort or our lack of competence in the use of digital methods may also result in certain reservations
in case of bank overdraft, it is a facility which is sanctioned for one year and normally company may not have to repay it in a shorter period of time
so, ah, earlier also, when we were calculating divergence, we were taking area direction to be coming out of the volume
for me the example that i probably gave you in class is getting down from a bus, there is no emotion associated with getting down; you have got down, you have got down, right
put it in the inner column
so, these guys, yes, heard the answer but they are not convinced that was really the case
when you define the advanced unit ramp function r t plus t naught you can simply write the value is 0 when t is less than or equal to minus of t naught and it is t plus t naught when time is greater than or equal to minus t naught
remember that there are some assumptions for the entire analysis, so it is not, for the same system how it is different that is what the point here is and if you use of calcium nitrite based inhibitor you can have a life of about 18
this is my second mask
this is what we call left side view
so, actually ohm’s law states, the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current i flowing through the resistor
next, question, number four: we are asking: if a sphere of capital radius r has a charge density which depends on the rate distance from the centre and is equal to rho, zero r, then what will be the energy of this charge distribution
in this particular case, it works, as though the rotor current component is actually drawn from the armature three phase supply
so, in this case, this is your this is your 2 pi b a n sin theta volts
now the in series motor phi is proportional to i a; that means, if phi proportional to i a; that means, torque proportional to armature current square
it is a big cost and we will have to be careful
what is a patentability search
cultural differences in volume of speech are also apparent and here i quote from a research by martin and chaney
these minus sign business does not bother us if you were to do a node based fem for 2d ok, but the trouble is that there are certain known inaccuracies with node based fem
so develop, evaluated the the patterns which i generated by l f s r with respect to randomness, and it is in found that the randomness quality is pretty good
if there is a derivative and time and you want to solve it numerically you would
so what we have to do first, first we will convert it into phasors, so van can be written as 200 angle 10 degree, vbn can be written as 200 angle 230 degree, vcn can be written as 200 angle 110 degree
so let's try to understand the nodal and mesh analysis first in case of ac circuit
so, this is your the only charges that occur in nature or integral multiples or the electronic charge that is this value
so, these cultural differences do exist and they mainly exist in relation to territorial space, eye contact the frequency of touch as well as the insulting gestures which are different in different societies
you might want to change the dc bias point then there is yet another purpose of the bias network, it is that we do not want mixing between rf and dc signals, so dc bias network the third application is separate dc and rf
that's one equation, and the other equation is partial b z over partial x is equal to minus mu, zero, epsilon zero, partial e, y, partial t
once, we know use a b, project it back this a b onto horizontal plane to locate b 2
so, you would find that these understandings are developed on the basis of our cultural understanding of how proxemics is to be unfolded in our architectural designs
indian formats are much better, much more transparent compared to us formats
so this would be the equivalent circuit of your the original circuit where the linear circuit is not known to us
if the resistance of this was r, this resistance will become r by two right
so, in that at second point locate v because 1
say the coil is rotating in this direction; i am just choosing a direction arbitrarily
and because of that rotation and because of the fact that the motor is the more deformable of the two materials and the weaker of the two materials in the motor joint, right
so originally maybe my wave form was like this
to get the natural response we set vs equal to 0 and we found the 3 conditions like overdamped, critically damped and underdamped situation and we got the 3 voltage value under this 3 condition
delta x, very good; next term is going to be a minus 2 that is n plus 1 right
what how should i characterize an obstacle or any object
so what we are doing is, we are replacing by position, so if i actually take this string and i pass it to python the resulting thing is first colon 47, second colon 11, because the first argument, the brace 0 is replaced by the first argument to format 47 and the second replaces the second
125tpkg now if packing plates is more i am sorry tpkg if this is more than 6 mm then we can use a reduction factor of beta pkg as this if it is less than 6 mm we do not have to multiply the reduction factor this is how we can calculate we have seen first is that bolt in shear now for bearing as i told that bolt may fail due to shearing effect and due to bearing effect and bolt may fail due to tension also the joint may fail due to tension of the plate tension failure of the plate that has also have to be consider so shearing strength how to calculate we have seen now we will find out the bearing strength that is calculated from this formula that is vnpb is equal to 2
i want to enforce tangential components
right, it is a punch on his focus as well
when you cut this resistance to 0 right maybe because of some contact some little resistance may be there after that you close this switch such that the path will be like this
even when we know it is a dopamine surgeon after sometime it will go down and that is why people will come and say here nobody comes alone unlike us and australia, there family is
for example, researchers tell us that gender conditioning is imbibed by a child before he or she has completed 3 years of age
so a tree is a graph where there are no cycles, because, you see, when i am connecting a set of points, there is no point in making a connection like this, where already i have connected the four points
so, this is the utility of the small signal incremental model
so, there will be subtle variations between one unix flavour with respect to another
but the main difference lies in this sub bullets
so, under starting condition i am going to have this much is the torque produced, provided i give rated flux for the machine, right
so, now, this is the line voltage line voltage is v a b v a b leads the phase voltage by angle 30 degree
what is the torque available for accelerating it will be what is generated as electromagnetic torque by my motor and what is the load torque demand
so the images charges are minus q at minus x naught, y naught and i have o, sorry, this is plus q, plus q at minus x naught, minus y naught, minus q at x naught, minus y naught and i have minus q at minus x naught, y naught
first step was to we discretize the like line segment and then we expressed it as in a
this is the front view and this is the side view
so your elastic force if elastic is determined, but then you do not design for the elastic force considering the fact that the structure cannot take the elastic force completely but starts deforming and getting damaged significantly before the behavior of damage formation that you observe in a given typology of structure needs to be accounted for
so, it is important that we become comfortable with some basic ideas that are useful for electromagnetics
so, if you were to go by the standard thinking of the need to provide cover concrete for the reinforcement, you will have mortar thicknesses which are comparable to unit thicknesses
from today onwards, we will cover module number 3 with lecture number 21, orthographic projections
so, let us see this example, so one problem in realising you see all the inductors and capacitors that we have discussed so far, we have considered them to be ideal
so, we will keep this plus over here yeah that was a mistake of a minus sign no problem
in the grid path thing there is one situation where you can illustrate this
finally, we will look at some starting methods
this is also a voltage control current source
this would be how internally, if you were to write a similar function, you would write it
but then you might be wondering that why does it have to do so
so on the electrical side these are the aspects that we have with us
so you have to add this up
the last operation is as follows it has a key this is known as the 10th round key and this 10th round key is xored with some intermediate state obtained from this during the encryption process to give you the cipher text, so thus what we will see in this attack is the attacker would be able to get one bit of this cipher text by injecting a fault
but here we are not looking at payment or receipt
so, what will do
here also $360,000 are going to be sales
so you can write it as, like this: r is the radius divided by epsilon, and this can be easily done by e into four pi r square
so if you take the balance here, so what is the balance here we have to take is that is coming up as 25,700s
so what i should be writing in calculating this magnetic field is: curl of b is equal to mu naught j, free, where free is the current which is done from outside, plus mu naught curl of m
of course there can be a some example you could be work out where this m, m, m method will give result which is better than this top down one, bottom of one
so, it means this is the point where both the costs are equal and that is the point of minimum cost and that is the point of c also right
7 tw okay thickness of web by 3 this is of flange so the torsional constant for flange and for web has been calculated and uhh is found as 11
so, what you can write now if you see the equation vt is equal to vs plus v naught minus vs into e to the power minus t by tau
now you have is, you have got the impulse response of the circuit what we have to do, we have to find the value of i naught at any time t with the help of convolution integral so what we will do now we will take the convolution of is and h functions so what we can write we can write zero to t is and will take the dummy variable as lambda so is lambda h t minus lambda d lambda
i mean as soon as the switch is closed, little bit understanding is required, you you apply here this your, what you call that your kvl
that it as to refer to the specific data member of the class and it as allowed to do so
these are not useful because i already have a point and i want to initialize another point
so, ohm’s law is the algebraic relationship between voltage and current for a resistor
so, it is slope is equal to your 12 by 3 is equal to 4, the slope is equal to 4 for this straight line right
so for example, if you look at mixer grinder, we use a single phase series motor which is actually known as universal motor
so, ultimately it is 360 upon 358 ampere approximately 1 ampere that is i right
so, basically the laplace transform allows a signal represented by a time domain function to be analyzed in the s domain
so do i have to look at the remaining n minus one numbers, if, if, if, they are n bit numbers
so, what i am basically trying to tell you is that because the brain receives input from all sense modalities you can assume situations and you can very easily identify cases from the real world situation where your own experience will tell you that this part of my memory is basically guided by the input which has come from a given sense modality
so, i am approximating a derivative by a finite difference right
so for a given, suppose this is our smart chart and say the power gain circles that we obtained are like this
so, we had three semiconductors, we looked at germanium, silicon and gallium arsenide
this is your plus minus instantaneous polarity at this voltage is v right
so, the first thing what we can do is straight away, pick this right side view something like steps are visible
so, it puts a between 4 and 5 and so on and now i can delete, for example if i delete 3 then i find that i have 1, 2, 4
now final point; it may not be final though
if you talk about much more smaller system, nano, then you have to go to nems, nano electromechanical systems
in the next module we shall be covering the case when they when we don’t have this unilateral figure of merit and then we shall that our choices are somewhat limited we cannot design it
in this process what happen a lot of developmental problems
python has an intermediate scope called non local which says within g and h refer to the value inside f, but not to the value outside f
we have learnt that there are public and private access specifiers which can be used to control who can access which part of the class
so i will keep it simple and i will omit it for now, but please realize that it will simply appear in parallel with these two
now if we say nested 2 we get this list
so like in 11th, 12th we have ncert few books, and we know that these things are going to be important thing and we have to note these things whatever it is
grad phi
and we have to take this into account otherwise without having everything normalized to the same amount, and we generally do that by making in parallel a thermogravimetric analysis to analyze the amount of bound water
for example, if i take an inductor and we have seen, if i now try to establish the current through it, maybe through a switch, then what happens is there's a back e m f or e m f developed in the inductor, and this e m f is such that it opposes change, that is establishing it, and this is also therefore known as back e m f
this ah ah this is 4 ampere and current source so, this current 4 ampere is entering here , right
and this process is repeated in the next generation as well
so, it can be focused easily, right this one
so, from one end it is shown 22 mm this one
39 and reactive load will be your node 2 and ah node 4 because 3 is compensated right
now we reach this point where we actually have to do some computation
so, due to copper loss and iron loss, you add you that is 2
so, what we do is we set a breakpoint in main and then when the breakpoint is hit, we do a disassemble setmylib int in gdb
so, the voltage that we will apply across these two terminals will be equal to 100 volt and the current i will of course, be at that instant 10 milliampere
therefore, this principle is called used on screen agents or pedagogical agents to be able to help the learners be able to connect which the content much more easier
and just another thing: you just see that suppose this gate is driving similar to other gates
so, the best way to be able to solve such a problem and allow your students to be able to learn better is that you need to break this particular unit, this particular topic into smaller smaller chunks or smaller smaller blocks that will allow your students be able to learn better and this is how it can be done
we have some extra components
the source is virtually shorted to the gate, so the voltage at the source is vii, the current through this resistor has to be v
but remaining 90% how we are going to collect
now we can compare the dimensions
but you have to see this right
so the customer could be wherever they are and their vehicle could be better, we do not need the customer to come all the way to the workshop which is the root of the problem really, and that it is not the distance from customer location but distance that the customer travels
so we have to calculate the different options and then we have to find out that which one is the most critical
we use what is normally used for the mouse transistor which turns out to be like this
and angle of impedance; that means, theta is positive because it is theta y angle of admittance if angle of admittance become negative then angle of impedance theta will become positive right
it means there is a variance of the cost and that variance of the cost is up to the say 4,000 rupees which is called as the negative variance
so, v thevenin is fixed r thevenin is fixed only r l is changing
decision making depends upon how we make use of that information how that information becomes useful for us how it is relevant for us so in the previous class i emphasized upon that they are the different tools and techniques where we can say use them for important decision making or for the different managerial decisions or say decisions to be taken by the say management of the different firms different business organizations and we discuss that cost sheet is a one such statement which is normally prepared under the cost accounting but the information provided by the cost sheet can be used by the managers for taking the strategic decisions very useful decisions right so we discussed the structure of the cost sheet that how the cost sheet can be prepared what it includes and what different type of the sub cost it works out because we have to i mean say find out the total cost of the product and in this competitive world our cost has to be as low as possible i was talking to in the previous class also the same thing that our cost has to be as low as possible
now this jtag eleven, fourteen and dot one standard this has been extended also in a number of different ways, like there has been and analog boundary scan version, a test standard which which allows also analog signals to be fed to a circuit
home automation or smart home is about building automation for a home
i'm just reducing the unwanted decimals
so, i can ignore the time part of these maxwell’s equations right
and there is another important object which we call toolbar
so basically, you are not supplying those values
so, let us discuss a little bit more about couplers
this is what we have done
and this was given by hermann ebbinghaus
so, now, it will get this call of the destructor for c param
now, this new view whatever we got that becomes the true shape
it should give me correct a, correct ah, magnetic field b
so, loudness of volume between softness and loudness can differentiate in correlation often with a lax or tense facial musculature and gesture perfectly congruent with the internal muscular effort
so, the direction of flux i told you the right hand rule, i will just explain you, you go through it whatever i said, same thing it everything it is here
so, in other words, this is a material that reacts instantaneously to the incident radiation because the response is
so, let us assume that the there is another component called time constant and it is denoted by lower case greek letter which we generally say as tau so, let us say that this time constant tau is nothing but, the value of r into c so, if you put the value of tau in the circuit, the voltage v will become v naught into e to the power minus t by tau
however remember that any of these correlations are empirical and which would mean given the variability of masonry these empirical coefficients can also be different
so, stability i have got, but is my answer correct that is the next question that is that is meant by convergence ok
so this is an additional check that you would make, that you have the area of shear reinforcement that you are estimating and then ensure that the vertical, in the vertical direction, the minimum cross section area of reinforcement that you have provided is at least one third of the value that you are providing for the shear reinforcement itself
when you balanced your op amp, not bias balance, your op amp, then the small amount of current that you find, right
this is what we wanted
so, there could be persons who do not study
9848 right, and voltage across that you are what you call there are two your what you call resistance this is capital r and this is your small r
t off is the time where now the output is off or low, t on is the time when the output is on or high ok
so, if you have a design and if by some means you can protected by a copyright, then you can stop people from using that design through your copyright, because it is an artistic work you can say that there is infringement of your artistic work
so, if you come to this, it is a dependent source right
here the principal axis, can be taken as these edges are the principal axis
h right
now, in this session we will discuss more about the case 2, what is case 2
just hold on let me see all right, just hold on
and that we have discussed how to calculate the direct cost with the help of a small problem and we have seen that how to factor the opportunity cost, how to factor the penalty, how to factor the cash discount
no eliza you did not say that you did not even say that the ever night before you get in the bed where you use to say your prayers, i want you to say the rain in spain stays mainly in the plane 50 times ok
although, when dealing with electrostatic situation, description by electric field and the coulomb's force were directly between two charges is the same as far as the forces on charges are concerned
for example, if you have registered a particular word for say trade in goods covering a particular kind of goods; say, shoes you may not be allowed to use that mark for selling stationery, unless you have a registration covering that class as well
but given in a arbitrary function how to get the best layout, that is not a very easy task
phi, which is perpendicular to s unit vector in the x y plane
so that means if you see the circuit like this when you are ask to find out the loop, it means that if you trace out various nodes and come back to the original node then this will consider to be one loop, right
imagine if you are made to drive a car, if you ask me to drive a car with the steering on the left how would i perform
so, greater than 4000 means we have sufficient light in the ambience, and we have to switch off the light
but at the same time we find that the cultural impact on this aspect of nvc is also valuable
2 1 2
we are, mind you, using the estimate of moment as axial force into the eccentricity, n into e that we have seen earlier
so, having examined the different components of masonry construction, four of them, we now start looking at the masonry assembly itself and properties of the masonry assembly, strength properties, primarily compressive strength, tensile strength, but here we are examining the flexual tensile strength and we will examine flexual tensile strength parallel to the bed joints and perpendicular to the bed joints and then the shear strength of masonry
in this approach we assume that output is one volt or maybe one ampere or as appropriate
so, every visual that is going to come like every screen, you first design that
and again the rule of thumb is supposed w is the width of the transmission line and a is the length of this section then a should be equal to 1
we have paid extra cost as compared to the standard cost by this amount of 2,600 rupees
now, what happens if say this coil is moving with some velocity
so, all those consensus are inside this bracket we do not care about it relative to these two there is a minus sign ok
so here again, you have 2 equations, but you have 3 unknowns
so, now, you get you get the value of ix, when you get the value of ix you have to just run the kcl at node and find out the value of the short circuit current
integral r d r will give me r squared by 2 evaluated epsilon and 0; and i am going to take the limit epsilon tending to 0 eventually right
we can make balance sheet as on any date, but normally it prepared at the end of the quarter maybe at the end of three months or sometimes at the end of one year
now, we will create a super mesh
now, r 1 is given; r 2 is given; c is given right
because it is so simple that by integrating the high pass filter to the low pass filter we can get a band pass filter
i would expect on this side field to be like surface charge, to be sigma cosine theta
so, just 10 into 20 plus 20 into 30 plus 30 into 10 divided by 10
similarly, no current can come out from these input terminals ok
since there is a cylindrical symmetry, i use the definition of curve in terms of cylindrical coordinates and cylindrical coordinate, since i want only the five component
so this is more like a tool which is used to get or analyze the quality of the test vectors and, depending on the result of the analysis, you can take some remedial actions
so, you have two unknown variables and two equations which can be easily solved
i take the definition given by wechsler and i quote him here
so we perform a process called static timing analysis
therefore, combining this two facts; we can write for low input frequency; we should use long gate time ok
so actually you are doing a diffusion to metal contact, diffusion to metal contact and taking the output on metal
you know in the ferranti effect; receiving end voltage will be more than sending end; that we have seen
what happens in the case of led's, by means of injection we create these electron hole pairs
let us see what does analogous system means
25 into 10 to the power minus 3 weber, this is the phi max 0
if cosine theta is equal to one or greater than zero, then grad of v dot delta l is greater than zero and i am moving
the next row looks like this and the next row
this is the previous circuit ok
now, let us increase the frequency, increase in the frequency you can also see that the peak to peak voltage is also increasing
now, let us see let us see the thick film technology and i will try to show you the actual device using the thin film technology that i have fabricated
based on all of this information we can next construct a typical address of such a cache
another possible problem which may arise is that learner may try to compare the different formats
let us now apply this to the magnetic field and in that case what we will see is that a dot d l is equal to curl of a dot d s, but curl of a is nothing but the magnetic field and therefore this s let me enclose this here
we took r
let them be activities
so you pick up this function and call it with the parameters, with parameters up to with this pointer which is p and the actual parameter value which is 45
what i will do is to use a current transformer which will step down the current from 1000 ampere to 10 ampere
but if you have that any problem anything you please put any sort of thing please put the question in the forum we will clarify all your all your queries right
and finally, she has talked about the target audience, budget and timeline which are the key aspects to keep in mind while designing the e learning content
then, join g and c in that way then, mark few points 1, 2, 3 on vc prime
similar to that also the unit impulse function can also be utilized for our circuit analysis and it is very important mathematical tool
now we can show that gt max will be equal to gp max which is equal to ga max
so, if you quickly go to the screen for a second, you will see that the experiment is to study the working of active band reject filter active band reject filter
we will make our ah your understanding very clear right and then and a 1 is the moving coil ammeter and a 2 is the moving iron ammeter
the vertical projection always be on that vertical plane
so, so long as this is not the case, we exchange values for m and n
so, this one, first you have to find look 100
similarly, i will have the reflected wave ok, so e reflected ok, so this is going to be
so retrieval of episodic memory is also a state dependent
so, this is the case of p n of metal semiconductor junction or schottky junction in forward bias
there are quite a few such bugs present in different programming languages
05, 5
the point is that we should not remain silent spectators in this revolution, that is why the objective of this course was to try and give you a flavour of the developmental aspects of embedded system
what we notice is that when the value of p4 becomes 50 we obtain the highest deviation from the mean, so the mean over here is 2943
so, you will use this you use this relationship omega is equal to 2 pi by t and integrate it you will get i average will be 6 ampere that is your i dc right; that means, that you are you are what you call average value will be just 6 ampere
now we know from the diode characteristic that the diode voltage cannot be more than 0
so you can have a design with a very good clock skew, very small for some designs where it can be significantly higher
once, we have that horizontal line the intersection point we project it to locate this b point
the next 4 byte, god knows what is there
so, dq is equal to idt; so, q is equal to integration ydt, but time limit is t 0 to t
so, before we go ahead let us try and look at some examples of all these things that we have seen so far
so, this is the basic the same idea here in 1d which i had
now the income tax paid is to be reduced
so now you have to apply the super position theorem, here you will see that you have 1 current source 1 voltage source and your objective is to find out the value of current i0 which is flowing through 5 ohm resistance
combining all this through a dimensional analysis i can create a formula for time that it will take to come down
so, we have calculated here that is a $318,000 just because of borrowing we have here
in the set of experiment is that we can measure
the typical letter in style involves for writing it for title blocks, subtitles, headings, notes such as legends, schedules, material list
so his friends counselled him and said why don’t you visit this zen master who seems to know it all, why don’t you approach him
so, voltage is equal to v s c current is equal to i s c
4 so 201
what is the formula of debt equity ratio
then we have infinitely fast; that means, that it is superfast, but it is not possible, we will see slew rate in this particular experiment, and we will understand and measure the slew rate
so, it is a l angle kind of bracket which usually for doors, windows, other things, we use it
5 percent drift
because electric field for all the past time instances is still being stored ok
so, a true liberal, true permissive mind is rare even amongst the so called liberals
if it is a parallel gaze in a right handed person it means that, it is dominated by the auditory thinking, i want to recollect the songs which i cherished is a young child
the period is 10 for the first 2, 20 for the next 2 and the deadline is same as the period
1 volt, 0
so, let us call this s plus it is on the positive side
the principle of operation is analogous or similar to binary search
so, this r 1 r 2 resistors help to get a feedback, and that is why it is a close loop output is fed back to the inverting input terminal you can see output is fed back to the inverting input terminal, input signal is applied from inverting input terminal we have already seen the input signal is applied to the inverting input terminal, right
so, their inputs are very important
so, you can take biomechanics and added with psychology and you come forward with a new introduction
so coming back to what we said actually are the emf equations which is va equals to eb plus iara we can write eb which is k phi omega eb equal to va minus iara because of which i can write omega equal to va divided by k phi minus iara divided by k phi
now, what is that set up and what is that assembly
how will you check that
so, the rating of a transformer is stated in terms of the volt ampere that it can transform without overheating so, this way we make it then volt ampere
this is fairly critical, now second thing second important thing in cell culture lab i have seen over the years how much over i can put all the things writing most of the time when people designed them they forget some of the basic things, maximize floor area i will explain what does that main maximize floor area into visible to you
lets call this block one and lets call this block two
if i carry out this integral; right, z prime runs over the current element and z is where it is and i am matching it on the boundary by equating it to minus e incident that is the meaning of this right
now one option is that you label them just like you are entering the arena to see a match
so, when you will compare you will come to know that what is vm, vm is nothing but 12 volt because ve is measured in volt
so one of the graph is called horizontal polar graph, other is called vertical polar graph
so, basically in this particular lecture, we will try to understand the basic concepts which are required to analyze those circuits which are connected with some time wearing sinusoidal voltage or current source
the dimensions clearly we will show, the hidden lines are clearly visible; because in top view as of now we did not remove the section
it is associated with good luck, but for many koreans it symbolizes just the opposite
a’s a’s
now, in this let us suppose i invoke c dot get re c dot get re, which will read the re component of the c object which is basically, now 6
depletion type mosfet and the 2 in conduction region, the great of change of current
for example, in this case this is the amplitude or twice of the amplitude of the signal applied to the x, i mean for to the horizontal plates and this is the amplitude of the voltage applied to the vertical plates
not newton, conjugate gradient if you heard about conjugate gradient method is a way of solving system of equations ok
so, that is another matter of convention with these greens function some people will define with a minus some people define with a plus does not matter ok
and if i do that as well, this is the circuit i get and here it is not just the small signal circuit, the capacitors are also assumed to be large
for example, in a meeting for a particular agenda item we might have allocated 40 minutes
it depends on your subject interest
therefore, difference in level of support is h is equal to 10 meter therefore, x 1 is equal to 300 by 2 minus 10 into 5764 this one the tension 0
so, here, the thing what we are showing trimmed edge is the paper up to which the cut has been done
so, it will not change here even if the input is going or crossing lower trigger point; no, not here
so the correct option is d
so, there is one root class and there one base class and there are two derived classes in this
that is what we are going to look at in this particular course on the whole, until now what we talked about was only a static machine
so, it will be peak value that is 282 kv
in this particular case n is 6, the spacing between these lines depend upon n and it also depends on the equilibrium distance
this is the same as before, we check whether i divides m and i also divides n
this is the one what i am going to pick; draw an arc
so it is not exactly equivalent but you can still work with this
now, we have learned about arcs and other thing
so, they will have a closed path like this, but i do not want to make this diagram ugly
now the interesting thing is that c data possibly is 1 byte here, which means that it can contain up to 255 the value incidentally that you have given to the 4 bytes of int happens to be less than 255
like we did in volume integral how did we
similarly bending stress we are getting 6mm by 3d square which is 138 mpa and permissible is 227 mpa so it is safe
so, the value of voltage source would become 2 into 4 that is 8i x and the direction of plus sign the polarity would be plus would be in the direction of flow of the current so that is why the below sign is plus up sign is minus and then in series with one 4 ohm resistance
so, when i am reduce make delta z make it delta z by 2 what happens to my error
so, this will be even more visible if i try choose the resistance line, probably somewhat like this, if it is at a higher value then i can show even better characteristic
similarly, at 2 and 9 points are on the same line, extend this 9 and 7 also in the horizontal plane
i am i have not yet substituted the basis functions ok
another interesting concept that is frequently used in microwave engineering is the voltage standing wave ratio
so if you go into the ng spice user manual and in the chapter mixed mode and behavioral modeling with x pice, x pice is integrated into ng spice
we want to say that this is a pointer type
but, now if i increase it a lot if i bring it like this here, if i bring it here then you see that now this green line and the black line will intersects only at 1 point
sometimes you know that we calculate quick ratio
the entire electrical energy that i am feeding in which i may call actually as ei dt integral
in this case here for this straight line here it will come, so it is it will 1 second only, 4 to 5 means only 1 second
different color psychologists have commented that wearing the right shades at workplace is important because it helps us in creating a particular impact on our colleagues as well as on our bosses and can enhance our career choices
they will not be sinusoidal if i am talking about magnetizing current alone
so the power factor can be as bad as 0
second, immediately say that this is ruled out
when the torque is zero right
say right this is a fixed resistance
the answer is both yes and no, because people or human assets are the most important assets for the business
here there was one fault b stuck at to one which has propagated from the input side to the output side
now question is that suppose before before coming to this figure suppose at omega 0 current is maximum becausefor your what we call for resonance circuit, we have seen that your the resonant frequency series rlc circuit say that xl is equal to xc
10 electron volts at room temperature, so even though it has a lower eg the value of the absorption coefficient at 2 electron volts is slightly lower than that of gallium arsenide
so, even at v g s equals to 0 that is in depletion type that is a channel between source and drain
so, this is equation 2 this is equation 2 right, may be made variable in order to obtain resonance, now solving equation 1; that means,rather than i will say equation1 or equation2 rather than i will say equation two from equation1 we got equation2 so, you will get omega 0 is equal to 1 upon root over i mean what you do is you from this
so your figure will look like as shown in the slide where the input port is short circuited in that case your v 1 will become 0 and i 2 is connected to the output port
10 percent reduction in the cost is not an achievable target
their market share is somewhere 1 or 2% and that too in the rural market, not in the urban markets
therefore, we know q new is equal to q minus q c; it is add means additional capacitor that is q c add is equal to1910
so, now you can see the top side is flat one, but these ones are slightly tapered
let us say i have a three phase supply here, so let me call this as va, this as vb and this as vc and this is the neutral, okay
now this way when it will come to some this point say this o a when it will come this o a will come here
so, number of revolution per second
so, from situation one to situation two, i have rho one in this, which gives me potential v one, and surface charge sigma one on the surface of the conductor
so, this was my original function; note that this is an approximation
which which is what we call conical frustum
so, a circuit element is said to be passive, if the total energy delivered to it from the rest of the circuit is nonnegative; that means, that the rest; that means, that suppose energy is equal to given for any initial time t 0 to t p into dt is energy because p is power and time watt second actually is equal to joule
so, this switch is not read, but you look at this lcd display here
this is e, this is p, so moment and shear will be developed
so, whenever we say v a b a positive, b negative
so, this will become a finite surface right and dv will become ds will become dl and remember this ds is nothing but n hat ds like this right
why this happens
jso is your reverse saturation current and this is given by ni2edhlhnd+delena
it is not going to rotate
so our design is available either in the form of a high level description, like in verilog or vhdl, or it is available in the form of some kind of a netlist, register, transfer level or gate level netlist
we will discuss two, three small cases and then we will learn about that how to prepare the cash budget and the budgeted balance sheet
now, suppose we have a magnetic material and we want to estimate its say bh characteristic
so, this is the same is that fairly intuitive right some voltage is induced across the antenna terminals that voltage is falling across both the impedance of the antenna and the impedance of the load
and what should be we doing more of
you can pause the video if you want to google and find out where samarang was made
well, the students commented that the problem question was out of syllabus and they had not done such a problem question in the class
the function has remain the same
at this point, i would also like to just touch up on that in c++, the objects do not have any other separate identity
and the long term plans is you will say plan for five years, then or maybe for the 10 years or seven or eight years, then for the next 10 years, for the next 10 years, so that in the next 30 years we want to reach there where we want to go up
so, we have to prepare this schedule now and that is the purchase budget or the purchase schedule and while preparing this purchase schedule or purchase budget we will have to take into account the information for how many months
so, finally, it will be the target value when this will be 0 and initially it will be this is this is 1
so, this is how, this is a coaxial to rectangular adapter or transition
this much for first year level nothing else
so, until now what we have seen we have seen amplifiers; we have seen the filters; and then we must see how we can design oscillator
so, f is equal to 0
then we ramp it up to 1000 to 5000 rpm
e z these are the three variables that i have to think about right previously, we are doing te polarization
the library is call libmylib
if the air gap is more i might have to produce more overall flux so that the useful flux still corresponding to the original quantity when the air gap was smaller
967
and in order to choose a good k, i need so this i can express in many different ways
a goes as one over r, so this integrand goes as one over r cubed d s far away goes as r square
this is the one
so, all the all the all the node voltages v 2 , v 3 , v 4 are taken as the you know slag was voltage
let us take this particular as a node a and you say that this is the current ir this current ic so your you can simply say ir plus ic is equal to 0
lets take one example here
now this fy by fs is a value that is greater than one and depending on the type of material we are looking at would be able to one would be able to arrive at what is the correct overspring factor that you should be using for a given typology
now, properties means different type of properties uhh structural steel have
we will first connect the current source i1 to the input port and short circuit the output port
so, to start with ac single phase circuit, i thought this will be the base to depth this side is upper side is n and this side is s right
cash and cash equivalents has gone up
so, input: three point five volts to sixty volts, input voltage range
we have seen that for liquidity we normally calculate current ratio which we have already calculated
so, this was let us say some r m
now we will see exactly how large they have to be
there will be an exam as per the schedule given on the web page, i hope many of you take this take that exam and do well in um
in this particular problem na is much higher than nd and since they are in the denominator this term will essentially dominate over the other term
everything else is just a way to make sure that we go it, go through this table diagonal by diagonal, and for each diagonal we scan the row and the column and compute the minimum across all pairs in that row and column
as you can see here, project management book of knowledge pmbok guide it is published by the project management institute pmi and this guide is used as a support to prepare for the certification offered by the pmi
we have to apply kvl for loop 2 and 3
it is pertinent here to quote a research by judee burgoon and others, entitle the visual and auditory codes kinesics and vocalics which was published in 2016
443 and also beta should be greater than or equal to 0
phi 2 right, we had said phi 2 is the field inside v 2 these equations do not talk about phi 2 they only talk about phi 1
so, this was my gamma normally why because i simply replaced my unit vector k hat by the unit normal vector n hat
ad into vd plus a cm intov cm; vo equals to this
so, this is i mean if your if your real power is p suppose if it is p we have taken if it is q then this one will be p square plus q square right
so, it is v minus v s upon v 0 minus v s is equal to e to the power minus t upon tau; tau is equal to r c the time constant of r c circuit, this is r c
and, once that scope is over then you cannot add new symbols to that scope of the class
now let's look at the third condition which says that the frame size should be chosen such that every task deadline must be met
so, with this you get the characteristic equation of the system which is nothing but the coefficients of the differential equation
it would be the same because i have just drawn a line in air right the fields will be continuous across this hypothetical surface
chronemics is a subcategory of nonverbal aspects of communication which has emerged as the studies in this field broadened
they are placed in the order because of their activity and if we imagine in nature gold is gold
in the fourth parameter you say logical shift left by 3; that means the second operand is shifted left by three positions and then added to r2
when cos theta, you can see from here it is v, t divided by s square plus v square t square
here is how a computation of fibonacci of 5 would go, if we keep a table
so, this is done by the signatures and the second thing about the inter machine attestation whereas we mention before the application could actually prove to a third party over the internet that it has a specific enclave
i am actually creating an empty object of that type
for that to happen we should have 1 a v beta is equal to 0, this in turn implies a v beta should be equal to 1
cost center begins with in case of the manufacturing products begins with the procurement raw material purchase of the raw material
so, actually it until unless you translate it to experimental your theoretical knowledge you are not doing justice to your theoretical knowledge that is what i can say
it is resistivity it is ohm meter
and these 2 loops do not touch each other, so then they become non teaching loops
so these are n sections of transmission lines cascaded with each other
then we go to another variety of mos transistor known as p mos transistor and try to make circuits using the p mos transistor
however, the net charge is going to be finite and you can see that very easily
let us write everything in terms of local edges first ok
this is as expected because that is what is present in the driver
2 volts, alright so, we applied 2 volts, alright
now he will connect this voltages, input signals to the differential amplifier
so, we say colours equal to set with no arguments
this is basically, this basically tells the system as to where to look for this file; whether to look for them in system directories or you have to look for them in your current directory
now, similar to what we saw in case of translational motion, in this case also we will see various frictions
we will apply kcl at this particular node and try to solve the equation
now, let us guess an object from the views
let's first calculate the change in the volume, assuming that this problem, this cross section out here, is a, so change in volume is going to be a y at x plus delta x, minus a y x
so, lot of this things continue and hence we can explain the adult behavior, right
so, c++ gives us a mechanism to be able to access those symbols, which are in the global space, which are in the global scope
the resistance can change if the external or internal conditions of the elements are your altered
because if b and c are anything other than one, one output will be permanently zero
so, that is a part of code which i have to write
if i have a particular frequency of current injected into the stator, i am going to get a revolving magnetic field which is governed by the frequency
and we also stabilize that alpha is equal to r by 2l and omega naught is equal to 1 by root lc
so, this was our; how will this get simplified under our assumptions, what components
let me draw again the coil so i'm going to have between 1 and 2 again b here is c and here is a, right
02 millivolt out of 2 millivolt
25 centimeter; that means, your ice radial thickness is also given wind pressure is also given and weight of the ice is 912 kg per meter cube
so, profit variances are very, very important
so, as a typology, masonry because of load bearing walls gives you the possibility of low axial stress ratios
so there is some kind of a shielding, so the noise on these lines will not propagate to the next signal line because of the shielding
in fact, you start repeating only those behavior which you realize, were reinforced by the environment behavior which was not reinforced by the environment you actually started curtailing on that you reduced reflecting such type of responses in life
now, the liability is there is certain, but the amount is still being decided
so, from p point draw a projected line p' q', which is 60 mm pq is 60 mm long, so 60 mm and it is parallel to this xy axis and 15 mm it is from both horizontal plane and vertical plane also
now, if you see that we will have close loop amplifier
so i keep on increasing the flow of current of the synchronous machine and then i note down, what is the voltage generated
i have shown you in the last lecture if primary flat and secondary flat are there, then depending on the angle of the secondary flat with respect to prime primary flat we can identify them
well, [vocalized noise] as the name implies, dynamic power is something which is depending on the dynamics of the circuits
so, for that what you have to do, you have to first short circuit the voltage source and open circuit the current source so, that you can find out the value of thevenin resistance
so we say this energy is stored in the circuit and we take it to be stored in the magnetic field b that is produced by this current finite
let us see how it goes right
so, i i 2 i told you v 1 minus v 2 minus 32 by 2
so, what can i do with these two equation to get rid of current source subtract right
now material price variance how we can calculate it
so, in that case what will happen, this v s v ss is equal to actually v infinity is equal to is v, this is your v at steady state now, as you can easily at this is open circuit
and then we were trying to look at if i am having the generator here and i am connecting a load which is a variable load, so we were looking at what is the terminal voltage of the generator and we were looking at what is the current that is flowing through the load which is same as armature current in the case of a separately excited generator
so, we will add the 5 ampere independent current source again in the circuit and then we will solve
so i can give it as v0
here, v naught is the initial voltage at time t is equal to 0 plus because what happens in the case of capacitor
there is no effect in changing the interaction surface for us
for loop 1 if you applied what will be the value
now, now for position b, let us do the similar calculation once again it will also be our practice
i may be observing fields at a distance of few meters
now if we want to do the other way that is we want to implement a shunt resonator in series, then that becomes a problem because shunt resonators using same open stub is difficult to realise
52, this is my rotor copper loss right
so, in that case this is and then you simplify and try to simplify and try to find out what is delta p g upon delta p right
a speaker essentially an electro acoustic transducer, which means is converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound; that means, you give an electrical signal waveform as the input and the speaker will generate a sound as the output
now this diagram shows how the test rapper will looks like
we can also support learners in terms of their varied language needs if that is not important criterion within your learners
i am just not writing the units, but everything is in ev, we can now do the same for the p region
12 kilo newton so this has to be equate with the external shear force acting on the column that is 120 kilo newton so if we make equate with this condition then i can find out the thickness of the splice plate should be more than 3
so the base drive or the gate drive for this power semiconductor switch which is given here to turn it on and off is shown here in vg like before as in the boost buck converter
there will be a pi here, and therefore there'll be a pi here, there will be a pi here
we will see later why it is important that there should be no impurities or defects
i can make i 1 plus your i c is equal to 0; that means, my this is be v minus v s divided by r plus c into d v by d t is equal to 0 right
now what will this ratio tell you
the first month in the next quarter so till the time we make this payment of 16,500s we will have to show it as a liability
so however due to the out of order and speculative execution of the processor the second statement would be speculatively executed
now this principle of super position theorem helps us to analyze a linear circuit with more than one independent source by calculating the contribution of each independent source separately
so, can we it is already connected to 220 volts
it is obvious this node knows to whom he sending, he knows to whom he is communicating both ways here
both are multimeters
for example, i would like to have a height of 50 millimeters
this will be connected here
i think that is pretty much it
so, these kind of objects we use it for rigid body links maybe four bar mechanism, this kind of things if i would like to really construct at mechanical engineering
now, if you draw the phasor diagram that phi as a reference and this is your v 1 at this is i 1, i 1 is equal to your i 0 plus your i 2 dash
and therefore, we can measure the amount of rotation or the angle of rotation by observing where the pointer is on this scale
so, this is actually i 2 this is taken like this right suppose it is leaving the dot
so, what we need to do is now with the new board we have to place one more queen
so there is v one, v two and v three
so, that is the simple thing
so, that is actually even scarier because you will get some answer for it and you think it exists, but under underneath the hood it does not exist there is a special technique of modifying quadrature rules when you know that there is a singularity inside it is called singularity extraction ok
hedwig lewis has described body language as “the communication of personal feelings, emotions, attitudes and thoughts through body movements; gestures, postures, positions and distances either consciously or involuntarily, more often subconsciously and accompanied or unaccompanied by the spoken language”
so stability, then something called transducer power gain we shall see in a moment in the next few slides may be, what is this transducer power gain and this is represented by the symbol g
answer is going to be yes because i have put this hypothetical current over here ms js ok
so, we need not worry how we got this equation right; mechanics has given this equation to us which is the second order differential equation right
so, the big leap of faith is going to be that everywhere in my right hand side this expression over here
then temperature inside the time doesn't change with time because it has a stabilize
so, he was perplexed and he took the problem back to the royal british navy and they examined it and probably took it back to sir humphry davy himself and humphry said, oops
oxygen or water vapor flows through the reactor and pass the silicon wafers with typical velocity of 1 centimeter per second
so, it means it is weekly balance equal to maximum 1 week’s balance firm is keeping as a cash remaining is being invested into the securities
so, graded compositions help to achieve that because they give you the wave the change in the band gap, while at the same time allowing you to grow epitaxial layers
so whenever we have a sinusoidal voltage rather than using that as a sign quantity, let us say this is t, if i am writing this with respect to time i have to add and subtract sinusoidal quantities, i have to multiply, i have to differentiate, integrate, all of them needs to be done on this sinusoidal quantity because i am sure fundamental elements in an electric circuit you guys know so v equal to ri, this is corresponding to resistance i can write l di by dt equal to v, this is with reference to inductance c dv by dt equal to current, this is with reference to capacitance
therefore, for the purposes of documentation, this eng spice plot is not very comfortable, i would say
v o gets connected to that and the input terminals of the op amp also get connected to that
so, we here we cannot get any steady state block diagram because of this is if we can put s is equal to 0, but here you cannot do that
so, the balance of the loan, loan payable is that is 45,000 is the balance of the loan
2 coefficient
2 we have discussed already that means it is a concentric loading what we have designed earlier in case of compression member may be that member it may be channel section maybe i section maybe other type of section when it is concentrically loaded then the design formula which i have already already discussed that formula will be used which is given in clause 7
so, therefore, this point is at 0 volt ok
so, these 2 would be considered as a source which provide current to the circuit
and rest of the area will not be retained, the area which is transparent, which is white, will not be retained
this is done by this statement where the contents of the global variable mylib int is stored in the eax register
now, next we will take another interesting example and before going to this thing, we have taken this kind of example
v0 would be the average value of this
so, how our circuit will look like
i am operating this at rated speed, so if it is a 220 volts machine or something like that may be then i am applying the rated value of field current which is corresponding to rated flux, i will get 220 volts as the value of voltage, so this is going to be rated voltage
so, in this case, io is known, i1000 is known, this is the short circuit current at thousand which is 2 times the short circuit at 500, and we just calculated it
it's only the uncracked zone that's actually going to be actively participating in stress distribution
his in a dilemma so straight and curious, then moving on to the next topic is a positive result
in that way make points p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7 and p 8 point anyway we have it at this end
the second operand optionally goes through the barrel shifter, you can shift it and then you can do some arithmetic or logic operations
we will have to a really design these operators so that we can overload keeping this stream types appropriately in our design
this pointer this is actually a keyword in c++, and this is a name
okay, so, i wonder what connection these caves, these set of caves, have, with design thinking
so, because of this t you will see a ramp at time t is equal to 1 you will get the value of ramp as 1
so so as long as you are not sitting on the charge, the divergence of the field is zero
and when we are looking at filed system it can be actually the stationary portion or it can be the rotational portion, no problem
so very few literature has actually reported observing ettringite at ph levels of below 9, okay
it is not direct compression but flexual compression and this is the basis that we use for the failure criterion
now, the goal of this video is to measure this charge which has flown during an impulsive current in a circuit using a galvanometer which you called a ballistic galvanometer
so, in the whole of c program, irrespective of how many files in which you write and so on, but in the whole of the program that will run as one unit from call to one main, every function name has to be distinct, every function name
will that ensure that learning actually happens where this e learning
so, the circuit which is modified and we place the voltage source in such a way that it is the current coming out of the voltage sources in the same direction and we short circuit the current i these segment where the voltage source was connected and we found that the value of i is same as it was there in the previous case
what you see here on the investors face is just the two lips going upwards
again the moral of the story here is don’t jump to solutions at the first insight itself
4 is 0 1 0 0
so here my new data is coming
so, this is actually v 2 is equal to m into d i1 upon d t right
$78,000 total is 88, less 10,000
so, how you can write
so increase of the interconnection delay i can make by appropriator routing
i was now searching for the beauty contest winners, how they express themselves okay, look at one of the recent expressions okay, where
so those costs, this is the hardware and software cost
in the surface integral, i have two green’s function
so, it is a variable whose value is a memory address
so, there is a whole mess which is going on, actually nobody stopped them thought about all these things
you might lie somewhere there or you might lie somewhere there but which means that your estimates can actually overlap
however in multi brand retailing fdi is not allowed in india now
so, soon after the call gets invoked the next instruction has the address 08048454
so, this is figure 22 right
now, you see, earlier, when we talked about the traditional routing, there, our main criteria was to minimize the wire length
so this is an ee type of core
so n into t by 6 will be the cracking moment in the cross section where your sigma minimum goes to 0 and sigma max is now the maximum stress in a triangular distribution
if we have actually touched something or we have experienced something with our hands, then this becomes a significant interpretation of the scenario in comparison to various versions which we might have heard from others
so, that is why that is why responding to the control impulses later i will come chases the load with the transient unbalance of load and generation reflected in speed or frequency variation because if ah this is a question to you, i am putting it you will answer it that if real power, if real power increases there will be a decrease in frequency in the decrease of the ah speed of the ah your moved in to ah your generate a turbines set at the power system right because generate a turbine coupled together
so, with respect to the ground; so, this is there is no electrical element
that is why everything is interrelated
so this will be the best cut
constant r constant
different tasks arise with different periods and we will discuss about the multi rate cyclic executive and how does it handle these different types of tasks and help to meet their deadline
so, in that case, now we will have to find out the standard time and then the actual time but we have to work out the standard time by taking this total time as 1 880 and then proportionately say distributing it among us the skilled, semi skilled and the unskilled workers
so, we will also see how what is the equipment used to measure this capacitor, there is the capacitance of this particular device
ok, so the types of routing regions can be either ah, horizontal channel, which is parallel to the x axis with the pins corresponding to the nets at that top and bottom boundaries
and we know that x is equal to magnitude of course, one upon omega c and this one is equal to 307
so, delta f will remain same, but this your generator ah sharing power sharing will be different
so, this was weighted residual and this is and as we discussed earlier this weak form is useful because it involves only first order derivatives
before discussing this, this type of filter let me a slight diversion and let us just try to establish what is this concept of image impedance
so this would complete the electrical design of the capacitance
now, if i draw it very long length, then it shows only one kind of arrow
this b b 1 will also be visible when we are looking from side view
so, we will see how we can utilize this amount
as you are seeing here though one of the left in title blooms taxonomy is based on the original work of benjamin blooms and others in 1956 as i attempted to define the functions of thought on cognition
so, at this point, you will have a call to the destructor of d
we are only considering whether it is when it is high, when it is slow, how will it will oscillate
what is n, n is the total number of branches connected to that particular node where we are analysing the circuit or you can say that it is total number of branches coming in or out from a particular closed boundary
this is your e 1 it can be represent by k v 2 voltage across the load
so i have this p mos, c mos, this ground, this v dd
now we will this clinker has to go into the cement and will see what is the inventory for each cement
now let us take one example to understand the properties which we discussed like linearity and the additivity and homogeneity
by design we made this entire thing become equal to 3 volts
so, how much is the total actual cost
now, it seems that if i want more and more accuracy then i should evaluate my function at more points right; for the if i want to fit a parabola i need more points then if i want to fit a line right
so what we do one possible heuristic that has been proposed is something like this: you consider the complete partitioning graph, you identify all complex triangles that exists there, you select one edge from each of those complex triangles and in each of edges you add one edge, which means it is something like this: let say, your complex triangle look like this
also the learning activities should be designed to enable the students to achieve these learning outcomes
firstly, this is the led
so these two are the same equations which we represented initially to define the h parameters
1 mm to 24
take the average, you take the four x coordinates: two, two, four, four
see, mark the sign also, it's a negative because it's a profit to us
now, if you think in terms of power factor p ab is equal to v ab i ab cos theta v ab 44
we have rstrip, which we used for example to remove the trailing whitespace backslash n in our lines, and we had lstrip to remove leading whitespace, and we had strip which removes it on both directions
we won’t look at entire periodic table, but focus ourselves in the area where we have the groups four, three and five
so, that whole block of statements is a compound one you can see an example at the bottom
the size of the grid, cells are appropriately defined so that wires for different nets can be routed through adjacent cells
so, the this is your supply current, there are lower op amps available that run on less than 10 micro ampere usually the faster op amp runs on more power, it is obvious it is obvious
so the fault free value of d zero and fault free value of the output is also
but, what i give you is i hide that spherical body, i give you that on this surface the field is all the same on this spherical surface and it is magnitude is given by some constant
so, now you have got all the nodes which are required to represent the signal flow graph
g is the total number of gates in combinational logic, plus if n
in the next lecture we will look at more into detail about the free function call essentially how free deallocates the allocated memory and how the link list are managed and in particular we will actually look at the ways to exploit this internal aspects of malloc and how to actually create an attack on this scene
so with this we come to the end of the lecture
excited with all frequencies right; so, that is well all frequencies is technically impossible white band right
similarly for resistance dual that is conductance will also be connected between node 2 and node 3, now next what we have left with is the capacitance value that is between this side to this side of the circuit, which current is flowing here
now this criterion is what you would, this failure mode is what you would link with in the manmuller criterion where we had the failure of the motor joint
this add it to the previous expression will give me the total energy, and let us do that
so, let us take an example, a popular kind of implementation of a current source ok
here, we have a 3 dimensional object and this we would like to produce it on the drawing sheet for different views, to do that first of all let us look at the object
and, in that edges which are the vertices and in those vertices what are the x y information
and then over here we can see the different other populations and we can see that these are evolved over time
so here we shall see how fault lists are propagated
you see fast rising spike
now, if you ask me to show what scores looks like, we see that it has an outer dictionary with two keys test 1, test 2 each of which is a nested dictionary
so, that part is satisfied
so, that length is d
we are not sensitive to what the child would
so if i put this equation so stress due to bending moment will be 10
so, on the other end, we can now say that, we draw the maximum power possible power from the voltage source by drawing the maximum possible current
first was this bias, how to bias a circuit, then how to operate
so, rho was the unknown and ah, so the first step was to find rho and to find rho what did we do
so that is, this activity is positively affecting them in terms of the marks that they are scoring
now, in tat for interpretation purpose the focus is laid on basically three areas the content of the story the feeling or tone of the story
so, if you look in the ptmalloc code and into the structure called malloc state you would see that there is an instantiation of heap info which would actually be a pointer to a particular heap
so, this was a very quick run through of volume integral equations i went a little fast because we know all the building blocks
they were fighting for property and see the amount of misery which would have happened at that time; continuously they were in trouble, they were hardly in the period of peace and happiness
so this dz is not there
devdat, basically we are working on solution towards it and looking at how, where people write, what activities go in and around writing, basically
it will be it will becoming 360 by 13 volt right that is my v thevenin 360 by 13 volt
so, this is how you can you can increase the voltage height and in the input signal or decrease voltage in the input signal and try to see how you can how you can design the peak detector
when we use the word processor to type a document or even when we use our cell phones to type sms messages, the computer suggests correction in our spelling
so, this could be in the visible region or in the infrared or uv you also have a case where you shine light on to a material and get an output in the form of an electric current
so, i have to put the corresponding isr in the you have to put the corresponding isr in the vector address 1 3; so, this is done
for a microstrip line that we were discussing we have found out what is an e effective and for a microstrip line that is the value of z 0 is often given by this formula where epsilon effective as we found was equal to epsilon 0 c upon c 0
iif you see, there is plus 15 volts, 2 ampere, common, minus 15 volts, 2 ampere, which is similar to what we haved seen earlier
there are two surfaces, upper surface and lower surface together which is the shear area, you will be able to estimate the shear stress corresponding to a certain level of axial compressive stress
so, that is the sudden injection of current into the circuit
so, what we are asked
so in green, whatever i have shown, you are actually getting actual arrival times of the signal transitions at every node
in other words, i can now write the following definition, i can say that the longest common the length of the longest common subword l c w starting from i j
so, that is the reason of teaching you what is physical vapor deposition and how we can how we can use the physical body position for mosfets alright
the efficiency of use of inventory had increased a bit
and when it does, then you really have a problem because there is no way to solve that other than using the initialization list
let me copy over this circuit
steel in the western part of the country and the gendals steel in the western part of the country, bijanag steel plant in i think in karnataka
at this point an interrupt occurs
go to quadratic, but what you need more there i mean what more do you need then
one terminal is ground with respect to the second terminal right
but if i have a flexible block where i know that there are six pins i need, but their exact locations are not fixed, they can move around
so, in this particular case, you have a superimposed load acting on the wall and then the self weight of the wall, self weight of the wall above the crack as the compressive stress into the net area that is being considered into x by h and the part below which is the rest of the wall itself
you identify the capacitor, you identify the resistor across it and make sure that the capacitive reactance is much more than the resistive
and every time when i align and realign these domains, i am doing some work physically or the current and voltage are doing some work physically on these domains which is actually manifested in the form of some amount of energy that is lost because this energy is you know just useless
so, this is the challenge of this problem and
so section 0 or other sections between section 11 and the 0 0 should possibly have a situation of cracking
now, in the second case the new power factor require can be found as that cos theta 2 new right is equal to p upon s t; p we know 6942 kilowatt and s t is 7200 kva
so this has become zero
which is corresponding to im, if i am a call this as im, together it makes up for i naught, which is actually the no load current
it is during this time most of these cells will
therefore angle between this , and these wattmeter measures actually , looks the line voltage here because it is phasor coil is connected here it will v a b because right and the current flowing through this is i a
so, it is not a golden rule you can have it the other way, you can define you electric fields to be at the centre of the domain and magnetic fields on the boundary
welcome to lecture 36
we have already discussed that profit represents the owner's funds
so, if i, if we do this, then the first output will come from this slide before the function call, which is this output, which tells me a is at this location
a laryngealized or creaky voice is also referred to as a glottal fry because of it is bubbling quality, a frying like quality
so, these sets of u’s are first set of u’s i can say interior sorry like this
that is very expensive because getting that frequent data and preparing the weekly budgets is very difficult but some firms who have got very advanced it systems they are even preparing the budgeted say weekly budgets
staring on the other hand is an absolutely different affair; it is never a part of our professional setup
because, as soon as you will open it, it will be open and you have to find out r input; that is r thevenin
so, system is balanced, so single phase analysis is sufficient
maxwell's equations everything starts from maxwell’s equation right
several million lines of code and then if the application developer has to write such a large number of codes to do what the operating system does, then the projects will take several years to complete and it will become extremely expensive
when the energy is much higher than kt, we can approximate the fermi function by a boltzmann function
02ampere with this with this we will close that first order dc circuit as many as 20, 3 problems have been solved different type of problems, with this i believe all the parts of the dc portions have been covered
standard cells as a set can be of fixed height but, depending on their complexity, can be a varying width
government reporting protection of assets economic appraisals right so quickly we can just rush through these these factors functions of the treasurers provision for the capital this is the function of finance department, treasury department in the firm where the funds will come from
people have a lot of places where you can help them out, you can find out what is going on with them, who are you want to try and help
this variance, this formula is basically that is the standard quantity into standard price per unit minus actual price per unit
here they are, you know, bicycles spokes that make the magnetic field concentrated here
you have the budget only for one level of production and the sales may be the overall performance
the second way is addition of glial cells
we will start, we look at the other two criteria, one when the axial stress levels are intermediate and you would expect that in a two story, three story masonry load bearing masonry construction in the ground story and finally a case where the pre compression level is significantly high
basically our m by vd ratio is nothing but the aspect is what is representing the aspect ratio m by vd m if you were to represent m as h into d m as h into d sorry v into h m as v into h divided by v d so this is m by v into d
and the type of a pointer is decided by not by the pointer itself, all pointers are addresses
now you can see that if i calculate at this point over here, the vector field is sort of diverging away from one point
so, in this case you can say that this option is better than this option but what is the net gain
tensile stresses when we exclude the possibility of direct tension, what leads to the formation of tensile stresses
and there are different databases both free and paid, which could be used for a searching
now, we are going to pick an arbitrary; let us mark a point from this, we are going to construct an arbitrary arc
so if you have such tight rebar cages and you have so much of steel, it obviously increases the cost of the structural member and you need such kind of extremely dense reinforcement to controls shear cracking
the price start is the interest rates are those who take loan consulting fees commission and service charges and the place place is the outlet the branch outlet the atm the online banking mobile banking and so many types of bank which has become extremely relevant in todays day and time
so, i have to say torque per turn if i want i have to multiply this by the radius so 2 phi, rather i should say phi p phi p divided by pi r ia by a multiplied by r
this paper was actually presented in oakland 2011 and a lot of the slides that we will be presenting today in this video lecture is by adam waksman’s oakland talk in 2011 essentially the talk corresponding to this specific paper
it is useful to have this macro model, sub circuit model because there are a lot of non idealities which will not take care in the default ideal diode which you can take care in the sub circuit model and it will the convergence, numerical convergence will be much better
in order to generate position independent code, the command or the compiler options are slightly different
in a language like c or c++ or java we announce our names in advance
so, what i want is i have a flat area where everything is gold
so, this obstacle is infinitely long in the z direction like a tall cylinder right
the z parameters does not exist for some of the two port networks because they cannot be described by the z parameter equations which we saw
we have to find the voltage v naught at time t greater than 0 and calculate the value of time voltage at time t is equal to 1 second and 4 second
so, if i connect this like this, then when this is 10 milliampere this will be 1000 milliampere or 1 ampere so, this will within 1 ampere
by folding it after projecting on to project onto this plane, then fold it in this direction, rotate it so that the view what we will get is circle
even mathematics and physics are not complete right, those are no mathematic there no godel’s theorem, so they are hidden variables
so, it is 4 to 60 years
okay it turns out that this id, the drain current is 0 if vgs is less than or equal to some constant called vt
concentric circles i am supposed to see
if you still cannot find the answer please feel free to ask me
therefore, for maximum power transfer r l is equal to r thevenin is equal to your 16 ohm and p l max v thevenin square by 4 r thevenin; so 64 watt right
so, it is a inverse relationship, right
so, let us now try to with this background let us try to look at the dc motor configuration, so let me start out with separately excited dc motor, so i have a separate excitation for the dc field winding, so this is going to be my armature i am actually connecting a voltage supply which is va let me probably say this as positive this as negative, so i am inputting a current in this direction let me call this as ia the field is separately excited, so i am going to have the field connected to a separate source probably with a field resistance as well which is a variable resistance
so, that is why we were interested in another phenomena called basic electrical circuits
so that divergence of d is row e minus v r
this is also sometimes called as a relay; a relay typically is used for some protective features in a power system
but for an exclusive or gate with odd number of inputs, lets say five we need only two test vectors: zero, zero, zero, zero, zero and one, one, one, one, one
so, this 10 ampere is also mark this 10 ampere and outgoing current if i take here
so, i am using the high voltage side for energising, right
and mark the polarity plus minus plus minus right
infinite input impedance i 1 equals to i 2 equals to 0, why input impedance is infinite
so, c has a w which is public therefore, this is accessible
8 and width of the web is 4
by the time the current density came from k to zero, how much was the energy stored initially
so, is a square matrix n into n matrix, where x and b are column vector that is n into 1 matrices, right
5 cycles implying true frequency is equal to 3
now, the elements which are in series with force voltage analogy get connected in parallel in force current analogous network
rest of the answer is then easy to get in
for that purpose these kind of gordon surfaces will be used
we are dealing with the statement of the cost or the cost sheet
so, here also reduced here also loss is reduced
when t4 is using the resource r2 and t1 is waiting, t4's priority gets increased to that of t1
if i am writing this for the generator i have to write d w m is equal to d w f plus d w e plus losses because in the case of generator what i am giving as the input is mechanical energy and what i am getting as the output is electrical energy
so, this supply is given for an your what you call for an instrument called variac, variable resistance supply
15 in normalised units and a d f right and like a like we have discussed earlier they use a gaussian source
so in this case, we are given the information about the cost, we are given the information about sales, and we are given the third information about the number of units
after that we will close the discussion on the cost sheet and then we will move to the next part that is the budgets and the budgetary control
write(1
so, over here under this assumption; so, i can write down that my displacement field can be written as just a scalar times electric field and b also can be written as mu h in particular this assumption we will change later, but it takes a lot of work
so, here you see that v p is given v p is given let me just copy this once again
and the bandwidth of the device is called the gain bandwidth product
so we have got one quantity displacement which is related to the free charge, like this
and based on those drawings, they repeat the pattern and reproduce the configurations
in the british society touch is permissible only at the sporting events and in celebration of victory or success, such as a scoring a goal or a point and in these situations stretching among athletes is permitted
within the computer you will need software
so, to answer that you should ask me what is a quadrature rule we just discussed, what is the quadrature rule
now, this is a silicon dioxide that that you can use the mask during the doping of p or n type source or drain
current you have to just simply divide the resistor, the voltage by equivalent resistance which we have just calculated
now, it should be it should be in a uniform fashion
so, this circuit 8 ohm this thing and when the first case the current is i 1 because i is equal to i 1 plus i 2 plus i 3 right
also, also in especially in the parent child relationship, those parents who are far more permissive
so, our goal is to obtain the phase and line currents right
so it means this is 5 5,100 minimum cash balance desired is how much
now when you see here this is grounded, do not think that is not grounded
so it means there are three situations per minute if you forget that 30% opportunity cost is ruled out then we can say that only two things are left with us
this is the cmos representation of a nand gate to input nand gate right
now, in this case it is connected to the load
it could be made linkable and also good things can happen
so, basically your r n will be is equal to your 9 into 9 by 9 plus 9 that is your it will become 4
so m plus n, this twelve, this twelfth is a number of bit
the type of exchanges: you can have a direct exchange, you can have fan out exchange, you can have topic exchange and you can have header exchange
this can also be written as momentum density can also be written as epsilon zero, e cross b
prof arnold did during this case study or why are this case study is to make students think of not themselves and what is true for them, but in a completely different environment, in a completely different culture, in a completely different environment setup
there will be an isolation transformer at this point
actually, you can imagine that when we run this code, it is as though we have this code inserted into our program at this point preceded by this assignment
so, now let us see the mates; we we we learned about the standard mates over here
so, first of all the main disadvantage of using plain concrete is brittle failure, so the advantage of fiber reinforced concrete over plain concrete is, it is enhanced ductility, post crack load carrying capacity etc
short term memory from that point of view given the time it has okay we realize that capacity is relatively small but this capacity increases meaningful if the items are divided into chunks okay and depending know whether you form a chunk of three or you chunk form chunk of four items approximately up to 40 items can be stored in the short term memory
alternatively the rth can also be measured by inserting a current source
now this wires are nothing but this kind of solid rectangular blocks
now edx has a value of 0 due to this gadget 1 getting executed therefore the contents of eax would be stored in this particular location over here as follows
if you just just uses that formula you just now shown, and if you do a simplification, you can find del f, i, del u comes to be only s
so the diode current will look something like this it goes and during the time in q2 is on you see that the current goes like this and half of it only will flow through this other half will flow through the other half will flow through the d1 diode so half will be shared during the time and both are off so you will see on the scope a pattern of the diode current which is like this and likewise for the other diode too you will see this is how the diode currents will flow and this is what you would actually see
and we have to make thread over that internal portion and we know that the stud has diameter of 10 mm
in the beginning of the session we had discussed that cash flow has lot of similarities with p&l
so the power and ground pins are only present across the chip, there everywhere, and because of the reasons i just now talked about, they are typically laid on the same layer and on the metal layer, not on the other layers
during precharge state it can go from zero to high
so, this is how it works ok
and, you are getting into gender identity issue, you are looking for career and you are trying to formulate your own mesh as an adult
so, most prominent example silicon and germanium; carbon we said in the form of diamond is an insulator
25 is equal to n 0 we know 800 divided by n 1, the speed
so, as the ohmic value of r1 is very low, the capacitor discharge is rapidly through ujt the fast rising voltage appearing across r1
5 and i 3 is equal to your what you call minus 4 ah ah this thing i 3 is equal to minus 4 i 1 and i 1 is equal to 20
because touch is used most often when we believe strongly in what we are saying touching can subconsciously enhance your credibility
this is the sketch mode where we are in; from there go to features, click features
very rarely
so, mark it as l
so, if i had my whole axes like this r, i am only enforcing it at some you know regular grid of points over here, but i am not saying anything about what happens at intermediate points over here, here, here and so on right
so, here this side is negative side that is why we have taken, but when you take this difference, please do not do not do that at that time
5 equals to this value then, i will have here this particular equation
so, oscilloscope is right here, and here you can see the output voltage, right
the learner is forgotten their motivation, their needs, their prior knowledge if all we do is think of how to attractively packaged and put up information
after prevailing su 8 at 65 degree centigrade you can lower the mask
what i mean is i am giving sufficient time, so that the current almost persists at a constant value, no matter what
e z will not be equal to 0
so the voltage source is applied to the circuit only when t less than 0
the magnetic field line i have shown only one, but there will be definitely multiple number of lines and they those things will confine themselves as much as possible to the ferromagnetic material because the permeability of the ferromagnetic material is pretty much high
so, this which is so, which we called before which is called virtual shorting ok
another alternative is by software diversification where you permute the locations of objects in memory so that by monitoring the hits and misses or by obtaining the hits and misses, the attacker will not be easily able to identify what instruction was actually being executed at that location, thank you
and this is going to be minus five over twenty five times five m m, which is minus one m m
ok, in addition, we have this q i, which means the rectangle empty spaces that are left for routing, say, means i earlier mentioned that whenever you place the blocks, to place them like this: so this can be your empty space, q one, this can be another space, q two, this can be q three, and so on
on the code, it looks everything clean and simple
let us see another case of stable of the stability circle and the smith chart
so, at least some i mean it will list of three nodes and some order
these are the three costs we have have now in this case when we are manufacturing a product we would like to sell it at the total cost this plus this right this one this is two at the total cost you would like to recover the fixed cost also we would like to recover the variable cost also but since the competition has increased in the market so what we are doing here our objective now will be temporarily that whatever we are spending on material plus on the labor plus on the other overheads first we would like to recover that so that material cost doesn't go from our pocket labor cost doesn't go from our pocket other overheads do not go from our pocket if we are able to because otherwise also the fixed cost is the sunk cost
similarly, u t also is differentiation of ramp function d r t by d t right or by integration or by integration u t will be minus infinity to t delta t d t right
based on that we can accurately find out whether it is tilted more towards x, or y, or z direction
so, this is in terms of days
what we need to understand now is that, if you use integrated circuits then your operating speeds can be higher
7 percent of the pass band response
same way we can determine if it is a phase shift oscillator, whether the given circuit will work as a phase shift oscillator or not
so i am calculating integral e, dot d, x, going from distance x to infinity, and this will be given as minus v, infinity plus v at x
now, the point is it has infinite input impedance, but why it has infinite input impedance because the input of the operational amplifier, the input of operational amplifier, we are using the fets mosfets right mosfets, it is has extremely high input impedance extremely high input impedance that we know right
so, this is not a good idea
so if you are to look for such a repository, you know what to take and see, compare whether they have all that
what is dq by dt, i
in the case of an led, since we want a visible light to come out, you preferentially use direct band gap semiconductors, the phenomenon of electro luminescence
so we have not considered armature reaction so i should say very clearly one more thing is armature reaction is neglected, i have not considered that at all
so, we would except the second print statement to give us 22
the first argument that you give open is the actual file name on your disk
so, this term n d phi by d i, this is actually l, the inductance that means, v is equal to l into d i by d t, which you have seen earlier also right, so l into d i by d t
now, see, in any case, the cost which is 70, we will not be able to consider because the market value is less than 70
now, the direction for front view is this direction
so you would not find marine life under the hull of a modern ship and you would still find that the bottom hull is not corroding because something else is corroding instead
but unbounded priority inversion is a very, very severe problem and many applications in the past have failed for not properly addressing the unbounded priority inversion problem
54 electron holes above the valence band
30 pesos and the net difference comes up as rupees 1,14
so you can actually see a picture here where the cut is made
so, this one; this one if you represent in a small block diagram; so, this is delta p g
so, these are the views given if it is box method where is the front view, how many views are there
first we calculate the total flexible budget variance and total flexible budget variance is equal to the total actual results minus total flexible budget for the actual sales activities labor
so, let us continue with are wave equation
i will be discussing about this particular thing here, whenever an unwanted person touches your door when you are not there, an sms alert will be sent
so you can see that in a greedy clustering approach, the vertices which are strong, most strongly connected, like a and b, c and d
another thing is that meaningless pictures like what do you see in that lady over there, nothing, it is a meaningless thing what does that got to do with the topics
you have learnt in your twelfth rate that heat flow in one dimension, the amount of heat d, q, d, t, percent, unit time, per unit area is actually equal to the thermal conductivity and the differential derivative of t s respective x
now in the previous module we have seen that for multiple sections of transmission line the input reflection coefficient is also given by this formula
so, the ipr cell is required and aicte has also come up with a guidelines for ipr for technical institutes
so, we can see now, in both of the cases the current i is same
16 kg per meter and the working tension is 1800 kg
cro is based on crt
so, we run this tutorial 2, give it this malicious input, which is input vm and we see that the value in glb is 3628800, this essentially is the value for 10 factorial are which you can actually verify
and this is equal to td that is deflecting torque and if you take a particular example of pmmc instrument this is equal to gi
unless an amplifier is stable even if we achieve a certain gain then that gain not be sustainable
for example: ah, suppose this circuit, as i said, that it now looks like a combinational circuit
as parameter matrix for an h plane tee will be similar except that these negative signs will not be here
you see, high pass aa, low pass bb, we integrate it, we join it becomes c which is band pass
in the last lecture, we are looking at how resources can be shared among tasks in the framework of tasks scheduling may be a rate monotonic scheduler or an earliest deadline first scheduler
e equal to 2 numbered which e which us
if you remember in our earlier balance sheet, i will just go back
it will be an approximation depending on how many terms of this series i keep ok
this one the function does not go to 0 anywhere
so, profit before tax, here the word tax refers to income tax only
so, there are you know triangles everywhere and so on
now, apply kvl to loop this one right, so what we will get
he went to his first set of students in sarnath which is close to the heart of india and there he gave his discourse, first ever discourse to 5 of his students
we were only dependent upon the indian companies who are manufacturing, say, miss garbage, i would use this word because had they been manufacturing and selling the quality product and fulfilling the people's requirements in a very honest manner, they must not have gone out of the market
this will help or this makes the gain for very low frequency signals finite and thus it will help to reduce the drift
5 ampere in this way you can calculate vx as 7
so interrupts are a critical aspect with respect to trustzone so as we have seen that is a monitor mode present over here so the monitor is part of the secure world and what we see is that whenever interrupt comes so it is first channeled to the monitor mode
then we come to the main function
and, the recommended plane to begin any drawing is pick the front plane
this is your variable supply
however, if you are looking at a cantilever, you can look at the distance between the end of the cantilever and the center of the support or the distance between the end of the cantilever and the face of the support plus half the effective depth whichever is greater
but what happens is shipping is a unique industry where income tax is charged on the freight carried by them
we went through the process of estimating the shear capacity of peers
let us try to understand how we will apply this particular rule with the help of one example
so i can write it like this: b d a is equal to e, m, f, which in this case i can write as r, i
so, what we have done here now is we have enabled aslr, so with this enabling let us see if the program still works
allow them to work with each other
you can refer to the books i have given in the course plan and the for this particular topic, standard costing, you should refer to the book that is the management accounting by khan and jan
so d is away from the load
but if you want to say scientifically calculate the cost and exercise the control or try to find out which are the factors causing the loss to the say the firm or maybe increasing the cost or maybe say there is a say resources going down in the drain which are causing the cost of the firm so in that case we should be able to know it at that a different level of the costing of the product or manufacturing of the product, what are the factors contributing to the cost and if the cost increases at one particular point how to control that
so, when these are released, like i do delete p c, that is, i am trying to release this object
so, the structure of these lasers is very similar to led’s, but when we compare semiconductor lasers to lasers produced by other means for example, a gas based laser there are some important differences
so, if you see the screen what you will see is like the previous active low pass filter the simplest form of active high pass filter is to connect a standard inverting or non inverting operational amplifier to a basic rc high pass active filter ,high pass passive filter; that means, we have this passive filter and you are connecting this passive filter to either inverting or non inverting or unity gain amplifier, if here the gain is one, but if i want a higher gain i can use inverting or non inverting amplifier here we are using unity gain amplifier
so, this at the time you will find that there is if there is a load flow studies we have seen that in the power system analysis course that decouple load flow right in the decoupled load flow, that your if real power changes right real power changes then your voltage angle is changes right
so, that was the left hand side that minus sign came because
is the profile of the teacher, like which subject the teacher might be teaching, is that important
now we know that output voltage is vds output current is i d, and control variable is vgs because if i keep on increasing vgs my current increases correct
so, you cannot reject the model uhhh as a whole it has some limitations we have already identified those limitations
now the load reflected part plus the part a magnetizing part is the current that will flow through the switch
or if you use wet etching for silicon, this is we are etching silicon right, then what you will have
there is no other way, that is how it will be
before we go ahead and design collaborative learning activities in an e learning task, let us pause at a reflection spot
so, the question is what happens when you integrate over a pulse where the bessel’s function goes to 0 right
it should in effect ideally drop to zero directly but because the switches are not ideal switches you will see that it will drop to zero in finite time
what is the one way of thinking about it was absorbed right
707*vout by vin)
so, in this case you are upon simplification you will get 3 v plus 4 v 2 minus 2 v 3 is equal to 0
now, in that go to features, come out of sketch mode, click this object; there is an option in the features swept boss base, click that
and, where omega will be this complex part, i mean the imaginary part ok
the example shown is that of animated and interactive educational games based on the work of nobel prize winners
j is the priority of the task t
this is what is my magnetic field intensity experienced by anything that is placed at a distance of 1 meter away from that infinitely long conductor
so, we have to see what is a colpitt’s oscillator and; what is a hartley oscillator we will see later
so, what is this again over here this is also a pure surface current pure surface currents means it lives in the surface in a vanishingly small thickness, only then can it contribute
so for example, we mentioned that there is capacitance that is involved; there is that threshold voltage and various other nanoscale aspects that could actually change the frequency of the ring oscillator puf
if i chose this i can chose this that is not necessary then omega c equal to 1 implies capital omega c also equal to 1 and book by pozar this particular relation taken and this is why omega c is equal to 1 corresponds to capital omega c equal to 1
so this is the basic idea behind the methods that we shall be discussing now
so, this comparator will get activated and it will trigger the set and therefore, this voltage will be high again, this will turn on this transistor again
so, basically when doing right in this form, watt plus your var this can be an volt ampere
earlier we have discussed about balance sheet, we have also discussed about profit and loss account and in the last two sessions we have discussed about depreciation, its calculation and various methods of depreciation as well
86 meter this is 25
one of these function, this one has two parameters, the parameter x as here is int, parameter y is also int
for production drawings, the components involved in the drawing for example, like one part is made with brass, other part is made with bronze, other part is made with iron
now it’s sort of convenient can i make the region of integration smaller than what i have shown right now
now imagine that there is some current i gate, the gate current was being drawn from it
if you just simplify integrate and simplify you will get i 1 2 i 1 t is equal to 2
so, 188 into 3 this works out as how much
f of e can go from 0 to 1 the immediate state is 1 half and then energy i will write e f here
you can find thermisters ranging from 1 to 2 amp, the lower end up to 50 amps or 60 amps at the higher end
you can simply find out by applying the kvl that is 10 volt is applied across through the 2 ohm resistance and it will define the value of current in the circuit
now total instantaneous power in the load, you can say the total instantaneous power will be the sum of individual phase instantaneous powers
that is the default automatic behavior
so, it is active input pin and it is active high; so normally it is active low, but we must hold it for two machine cycles for getting it active sensed
this output will be ab, x or gate
now further execution from this location would result in a segmentation fault because this is an invalid location
so, increasing ef will be done by adjusting the field current, this is done all the time in the power stations
again rupees 1
for that what i have to do is, let me call that as zl dash probably because zl is the actual impedance connected on the secondary side, zl dash is the equivalent impedance i am visualizing from the primary side that should be equal to v1 by i1, right
i have commented out the copy constructor
so, if you see here, what we have written
so, this clearly explains as to what is the difference between inheriting impure inheritance and inheritance and overriding of a function
with respect to that a b line construct another projection line
ah there is nothing like this method is advantageous that method is disadvantages, it is just one protocol, because of easiness in observing these planes, we are going with first angle projection system
that is why we indicate dc by a straight line
95 angle minus 79
so let me go to the terminal and inside the terminal i will go to the the okay so we are in the directory and we will generate the net list and also call ng spice after we have generated the net list
you might introduce some costly delays in the design cycle which you may not want
suppose they have issued a 10 year dementia, 9 years are over, this is the last year
so, let us just sort of list out the two advantages that we will get from this ok
definitely i will not have, now i have to look at the difference between a and a, b and b and c and c very clearly they will be not together, they will not be changing together
let me show both and later depending on convenience i will show only one or the other
so, what you do is you construct a polynomial of order n such that it is orthogonal to all lower orders of polynomials ok
the first one is to just add all 3
you believe in the absolute values also and if you are a borrower you should do you can do this kind of things
so, e b can be written as k into phi n per motor back emf
also when we are manipulating data itself, very often data comes from multiple sources
so let me first start with the development of steel fibres in us and the concept behind the development according to romualdi and baston they were at carnegie mellon is that concrete is a brittle material, in a brittle material obey the griffith fracture criteria that is fracture strength is inversely proportional to flaw size, smaller the flaw size considerably higher fracture size, so they said that if you use fibres randomly distributed fibres they can be closely spaced, so you can increase the tensile strength
so you can give a damped sign wave also
so let me just illustrate
and the exact line length that is beta rl can be found out from this value
similarly, if there are any intricate shapes we encircle the area of interest and then show it as enlarged views with clear cut dimensions
so yesterday we started on 3 phase induction motor and i was talking briefly about the 3 phase machines in general
if you work out the re work out the whole costing system, what is the variable cost now
so, these are some examples of values of type int
and we see here now that what happens as you increase the amounts of csa, you see the increase in super saturation
so this could mean that the program will execute until line number 10 and then it will wait for further action
so ef corresponds to the induced emf corresponding to your revolving magnetic field created by the rotor
there are some shortcuts which are easy to remember and use; very often you want to take the first n characters in the string, then you could omit the 0, and just say start implicitly from 0, so just leave it out, so just start say colon and j
so, yellow and blue are the input and output, and you can see that the output is following the input
this is the overall purpose of having a closed loop control system
they are making last means other companies are gone out of the fray but these two companies, vdiocon and onida they are making their last ditch effort and i don't see that there is a future for them means in the time to come they will have to go out of the market
charge distribution: the theorem says that, given the same geometry of conductors, a charge distribution row one which gives rise to potential, v one plus system, v one d v plus surface term, v one surface sigma one d s, is same as integration v two, row one r d v plus v two surface sigma one d s
so, this is actually series r l c circuit series rc circuit
so, even if you see the input is actually crossing the lower trigger point several times here going up above the lower trigger point, going down the lower trigger point it is crossing the lower trigger point
now another course another one this time we have taken
c s h without going into the details is a layer structure
so, the power is this i mean let us say a poynting vector the poynting vector is going as 1 by r square right
so as soon as the switch is close that your what you call capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously that means, it will be actually v 0 plus
here there will be two windings shifted from each other by 90 degrees
so, the limited broad disclosure without disclosing the details of how it is being done should work as a strategic disclosure for instance for getting into a joint venture agreement or to bring a partner or funding for the university
what are the instructions are available for supporting these features
so, everywhere in this equation wherever i have i, i will just put minus i ok
so, at the load the complex power absorb is, so s load is equal to 3 i p square into z p if it is a balanced system, so i p square z p per phase into 3 right
if you remember these points it has these are repeated in several paths when we talk about the operational amplifier ok
therefore, a lightning flash may have a single stroke or a sequence of several discrete stroke; as many as 40 it can happen, separated by about 40 millisecond as shown in figure 15; so this is actually figure 15; so dart leader, return stroke; everything is shown
so, with such a data structure this is the outline of how our strategy works
so this is just for your understanding sake
what we are actually doing is for the deflected shape, considering the deflected shape, we are looking at in the deflected profile, what is the point at which the, in the deflected profile, what is the point at which the in the deflected form where is the gravity force acting and at what eccentricity is it with respect to the base cross section, inner edge of the base cross section
then i found out that here the b in is equal to j 1
now you have an unexpected event, you just think what is it
so, here in this green's function r m is being held constant because the region of integration is i mean the variable of integration is my prime coordinate
otherwise that 50 percent energy missing if you had considered that you should have found actually ah it is here in the parasitic inductances right that because it is missing means; that means, some where it has gone ; that means, some where it is stored
so you can be analytical about this and actually do a plot and see if it actually matches up
for example, here the material element is different, the sectional area is different; the sectional area is different, the sectional area is different
so, in the case of silicon, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are at different values of k; top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band have different values of k
so what you can do, you can use another layer
here once again gamma represents the propagation constant and z0 is what is known as the characteristic impedance
so, we now have a situation where instead of doubling the photon intensity reducing it by half
as we have seen before the cache memories could be very abstractly represented by this particular figure
and therefore, the class d can actually invoke that function on an object instance and certainly this function will get added
so, you can say that i 1 is nothing but v 1 minus v naught by 8
so, this is the module out line for both the module 36 as well as module 37, certainly the blue part is what we do in this current module and that will be available on the left of your screen also the slides
so in that case volt is v2 you will get as 8 volt and finally using super position theorem what you can say the total voltage
but all these things are really not required, you need to understand better about the parameter you are trying to control in an application and then you can select an appropriate method of control
here a picture of bridge is shown, if you look at carefully it contains many line elements, it looks like a wireframe
so, for this means the quantity variance is basically the variance between the standard quantity required for the one unit of product that is the finished product and the actual quantity we have used
then we have seen photolithography and its process
but the advantage is, if we define a constructor then as soon as the control will pass this particular point that is when the object gets instantiated immediately an automatic call an implicit call will happen to this method, and that call will make sure that top is indeed assign to minus 1
so, it is connected to this transistor gate of this transistor; so, gate of the transistor getting 0, so this transistor is turned off
so the equations that i have is: partial e y over partial x is equal to minus d, b z over d t and partial b z over partial x is equal to minus mu, zero, epsilon, zero, d, e, y by d t
with the same first key for example, with the same different first key for example, test 1 and test 2; you could keep track of two different scores for dhawan
so, in general if we take first condition that xl minus xc is equal to r ultimately mod xl minus mod xc is equal to actually r right
which will help you recollect your events the memory of the evnt rather than whether you where able to complete it or it was not completed
therefore, after the function gets completes its execution which we will see as in the code
so, now, n hat is here and the wave is hitting non normally, but what approximation am i doing
so, now if vo equals to ad into vd plus acm into vcm; if i take advd as common, then finally, i will get an equation which is similar to this
this is the way we show it
so if you see the c1 is connected between this terminal a and terminal b
it will be achieved simply by sorting the terminals because only at that condition the maximum current would be delivered by the source
you see intensity of the signal focus
and if we have an ideal c in shunt, then we can also go a long clockwise direction in the y smith chart
from this we can then take it to the limiting case where we said that the limiting case is when you have tension cropping into the cross section
if i want so i mean the hint i am trying to lead you towards is change of variables, is there a change of variables that can map the 2 triangles to each other this what i am asking
5 in to this your area = 75 * 10 to the power minus 4 weber
if it is a steel, these are not just parallel lines, but two parallel line together we have to show with a gap
so, let us now calculate this standard time compared with the actual time in all the three categories of the workers and then we see total time standard time which is 1 880 is equal to that total time 180 or not
so current is limited only because of the internal impedance of the armature
omega j omega; so forget j is a constant i am going to get omega; and omega in terms of wavelength is
t3 does processing with r3, t4, tn minus 1 with rn minus 1, and tn needs the resource rn
so one reason why we have most ultra high performance concrete using sand is to make sure that flowability criteria is satisfied and also you will see in these tables a lot of other fine powders, there is silica fume, there is ground quartz
now, we want to do fibonacci of 3
so, if you write the expression of i l, then your i l is equal to v divided by r plus r l right
now, those three points are not anymore three points
so, let us it is parent is d, d does not have any y; u, v and w, it is does not have any y
so, this is your rms value now form factor will be same way you can get it it will be 1
supposing, we have defined a function square of x, which just returns x times x; and now we can say, apply square to the value 5 twice
and then there is a testing phase
so, it means ultimately what is it
now the major solutions given are in the form of big paycheck
but if i want to measure it whether it is 63 volts or 10 microfarad or not, how would i know
hence, you have a number of approaches available to model infill panels and several studies look at comparing these, many of them are empirical, many of them are semi analytical or semi emperical
remember this list comprehension notation
now, when you transform this through 1 by s as a block you get the value of i s here
so, that is why your ah this is and it will take slightly more time because you have reheat time constant; 10 second is there little bit slower
because in the month month of june only 10% will come from the sales of the current month that is a month of june
if we have a simple cross motion line like this with a filter with a gap coupled open circuit resonator, the characteristic impedance of that open circuit resonator is z1 then this is a series resonator in shunt
since base classes are independent of the derived class you cannot control that they would not have members with the same name
so, it is v angle 0 x c is angle minus 90 degree because, of j minus j it is minus 90 degree
so now, see the x, y and z axis values, you can see the x axis value is 44058, the y axis is 36873 and of course, it varies
so, we were talking about this natural progression of stages of development which each of us has gone through
so, l 1 if you see that this is actually mean path
1 and e f i is 0
so, if i do this experiment 3 days 4 days every day i will get different reading
at the rate of rupees how much
so an internal logic file is a user identifiable group of logically related data
but gamma l will have a maximum value of 1, one which we cannot increase it and uhh, that’s all basically
as we design e learning using a learner centric approach some of the recommendations that we have to keep in mind, are one that we should become aware that there may be a diverse range of learners who will be accessing, who will be experiencing the content that we have created
by our analysis we are going to put a queen in the first available column, namely the top left once we do this; it blocks out the first row and column and the main diagonal
in the block you will have the transfer function of the system that is a upon s plus 1 upon tau and ys will be the output
these arrows will nicely guide me back in over here
these sensors are sensitive to a range of gases and you can use them in room temperature
i can do the same thing; i can do the same thing for the second set of equations involving curl of h
this could be understood as a physical embodiment or how it will look
the actual solution right exact solution; so, we can call this is the, in the olden days where there was no computation you try to go from here to here by doing what analytical right, but we know that is not possible many times right
and, especially these are this suppose to be full lines in the top view
code also code also very easily can be written ah for such kind of system, but that is beyond the scope and one can verify the result using writing code and matlab simulink you will find all the results are identical right
note that c and a are essentially the same location, c and a are pointing to the same memory chunk therefore when we have operations like c and *c and *(c+4) what you are essentially doing is modifying the forward pointer and the back pointer essentially when we look at this from a linked list perspective what you would notice is that we are modifying the linked list pointers
so that this message this is a top secret message get displayed on the screen, so note that in anywhere in this program the global variable s is not used however we see that when we compile this program and run it we would obtain the global secret message, so let us do that
00 and it is favorable because the favorable variances are more than the adverse variance
if i say that a dash is placed at 150 degrees rather than 180 degrees
another component that is frequently and most widely used in microwave engineering nowadays is the microstrip line
one major issue is that you are losing calcium hydroxide so you are causing a reduction in the alkalinity of the system, okay
we can assume that stacks grow to the right
negative side of
so you move on the other side and you can possibly fall in this valley and reach this solution which has a even lower cost
the reuse estimates are like this
because you’re putting value of current as a current conjugate not be voltage as a conjugate
then go to features; rotate the object first, then extrude boss it shows something like cylinder can be made, but i would like to give something like taper maybe 1 degree, 10 degree, 20 degree
because the current actually i for a if you have n ah just a just a minute for you i will make it i will make it for you, right
so what i anticipate now this implies, by analogy with this, that a would actually be some a phi in the phi direction
so three, six, three, six together is connected to one by a horizontal line
so, what i do is that i assume u to be constant at that iteration find out the new x right
so when external sulphate attack occurs the external sulphate gets into the concrete, reacts with the monosulphate and recrystallizes ettringite and this formation of ettringite is now happening in a hardened concrete and from our understanding about the structure of the ettringite which i will also explore in some level of detail in the forthcoming slides ettringite has an expansive nature
every all these things are given downwards, but this is for your understanding
now, users of accounting information who uses that information
that is the user, the student per se
a positive eye contact suggest interest as well as preparedness on the part of the candidate as well as it also suggest that the person is careful of the employers, time and energy and is fully prepared to appreciate it and this is reflected not only with the help of the answers, but also with the help of eyes eye level conveys confidence
the law allows you to copy few pages provided there are certain restrictions to it for instance it is for personal use
now, when you have i you need to specify the initial condition also because you have this particular aspect we discussed when we were talking about the signal flow graph then how to add the integrated block
and we have seen what is inside the integrated circuit
so, this will be run at rated speed and i will make sure that this field current is controllable, if i have to have the field current as controllable, generally what i would do is to connect the potential divider preferably
so, in the session we discussed about the norton's theorem, a particularly in those cases where the independent voltage or current sources available
so, i have to take the derivative of this term and this term because both of them are non zero in e e 1 right these are the terms will not appear because they are not in the support
so, why is that let me draw it, this is the static characteristic output versus input input is what v p minus v n this is how we draw it and then this is this characteristic where this point is v supply v supply is the power supply and the minus power supply this is minus v sup ok; and so, this is the static characteristic now to find v o we need both v p and v; now v p v p is known v p is 0 ok
full minus sign
this flux line means you take a paper, and current is entering into the plane or into the paper right
so, mu naught h naught from the first term sorry; this will be mu h because i subtracted 2 from 1 and minus mu naught h naught, the m term is vanished
so that is why this thevenin equivalent replacement technique is very powerful tool in our circuit design
of course we won't have to worry about them because what do we do with this we just neglect them
this was a very simple exercise
so if you if you apply kirchhoff’s current law, you will get i that is the current coming from the voltage source is nothing but the summation of individual currents flowing in the individual inductors and finally the objective is to find out the value of equivalent inductance of the circuit
if all of these del f i, del f i in values give non null values, that if you take the product, the final product will be non null
so, you are not going to get a stack of bricks from the structure itself
website that we specified you would actually see that there is a directory called nptel codes, go there
we will see what we can we can show it to you
similarly, if i come to a smart phone, then i will have again these functionalities of call and answer, redial all this, but i may have some additional functionality
but, your viable one set, certainly two does not remain viable because here you are using just one parameter
so you can use it to quickly transform data from one format to another and to you know change the way it looks or to resize it and so on
so no two buffers can be exactly identically in terms of the delays
and also the other reason is low productivity improvements
so this is going to be my input power so obviously i am going to have reduction in the input power also probably because of which i will have reduction in the output power not reduction in the torque but reduction in the speed
finished products have to have durability, finishing, quality everything in place
so, if you take b as a reference node then it is potential can be at 0 degree, so at 0 volt and voltage v ab is nothing but simply voltage at node a
so here you can see the load versus the displacement
so, this term is becoming this term right, except now h minus h incident is h scattered, which is already there right ok
well, when it reaches 1 then 1 divides every other number, so m percent n or m divided by n, the remainder will be 0, so we will return gcd of 0
so, equation 65 we have derived x 1 is equal to l by 2 minus ht upon w e into l
so, you just apply k v l, just apply k v l here, right
on the other hand, if i take a point here we are all the light is coming in, then i will say this is convergent as converging to this point is diverging from this point, here at this point there is really no convergence and divergence they could be as we just discussed divergence of this point, because everything is coming out of here
i want to pass rated current, right
so, we will have some positive so flux downwards, but it will not be maximum it will have some lower amount smaller amount some small value, here also we will have some flux, but the value will be smaller
so, this is exactly like our mobile tower problem j is the location of the mobile tower and this object over here inside is some i mean some obstacle could be anything ok
however, we find that it is not only the structuring of the micro space, but it is also the structuring of the micro space which is important to understand the principle behind proxemics
this means the capacitor is charging from zero to high voltage via this path
so, this is how it moves let me keep it here this is for some value of v 1 positive v 1 ok
so, there is a difference of 25,000 which is further profit
suppose there are two strings, so that there's a boundary on the boundary, whatever wave comes in, right
similarly, a 1 b 1 perpendicular to a 1 d 1; so, perpendicular to do that we have to draw that; again, perpendicular to that perpendicular
we have already just seen that the information is raw data, it needs to be reorganized and converted into relevant information as per the needs of the user
standard price for the actual usage of 830k of rupees, 30 k at the rate of rupees 4 is rupees 3320 is going to the final amount and less actual price for actual usage
so again, from the edges i should see a large diffusion
3 here, that is state 2
so, or say now a days because the parents would play nursery rhymes on their mobile phones and they would like their kids to pick it up before they go to the school
as mentioned earlier each led will contain a reflection spot in between to promote your engagement and articulation, you should pause here and respond to the question or activity before you continue where the instructor addresses common expected responses and summarizes the concept and the rest of the led
do you know what is a full form of nab
so i am going to have multiple segment like this and each of them is actually insulated with mica, do you get my point
each subset will consist of a single point and they will be all connected by some arcs
so, we have a regime where the carrier concentration varies within 10 percent
now can we solve this equation using what we already know which is the green’s function over here can i use this what do you think
with this we will stop here where at the end of the lecture and we'll elaborate these issues in the next lecture
so, plot v 0 0 minus i
the code i have already discussed with you
so, it is a confidential statement it is kept under a strict control and if any other company has to know about the costing process of the other company then they use the spying
so to form n type, we are going to replace arsenic by group vi
so, minus 1 to the power 3 means it is minus, right
and we call that a passive layer, passive because no more corrosion can take place
if i have right now water in a pore here so this water molecule is moving around at random in the pore, if it hits the surface it immediately relaxes
let us go through them very carefully
that next is you when you solve it look from figure a that is all this things solutions are given to you right
so, those rectangular blocks are that and this portion like a groove, we will see something like two lines and this entire part, we see it like connected by that point
so, similarly, protection of the computer center from the heat and fire, lighting the organization, providing air conditioning facilities, etc
ok now, so we have looked at the sub problem for placing one block only, assuming the other j blocks are placed
i will take another example
therefore, copper loss at where yourat maximum efficiency iron loss is equal to your copper loss right
225 electron volts right in the middle of the donor level and the conduction band
for summation amplifier, first voltages are added and then amplified
so, this is your this is delta f ah same thing; so, this is coming here this delta f actually coming from here
for the class b as i said it conducts for exactly 180 degree
that is why it does not represent that 20 volts is it looks bigger waveform or one volts which smaller both look same
we will assume as a thumb rule the accidental eccentricity is 5% of the side dimension of the building, the dimension of the building perpendicular to the direction of the earthquake
as the name implies, a p n junction is formed between a p type semiconductor and an n type semiconductor
what will be the ultimate strength and what will the yield stress
so, the point is here i have a material which can be melted at 500 degree centigrade and beyond 500 degree centigrade you will get evaporation right
i do have definitely a multiplication factor, no doubt, but it is a measure of flux
this is the way
2 because other value is not feasible right
notice that we have already computed fibonacci of 3, but this will blindly require us to call this function again
you know do not do it
we have also discussed that we can do horizontal as well as vertical analysis but the most important type of analysis is ratio analysis and large number of ratios can be calculated serving variety of purposes
so, which means here it is, arity is 2, here the arity is 1, but just such kind of changes you will not be able to do yourself
so once again we draw our circuit
so noting down either written content or graphical representations, representations like diagrams
so, i will have minus del by del t, the del cross operator acts only in space so i can take it across the time derivative alright
we have to do it in a different way, right
if you wanted very simply you can say m equal not equal to n and m equal to n
4 op amps into one integrated circuit quad op amp right
the second rule is called as the request release rule
for example to this problem which is which has your microwave, tower and sending your waves to you can i study it mathematically and why would that be of interest
if it had been a delta connected induction motor, i can say v naught whatever i read is directly line voltage as well as phase voltage whereas i naught whatever i am reading current
so, first we have to create the serial communication; the name that i have given is “bluetooth”, with these two pins d8 and d2
so, that is why here we are representing load with zl
now in vertical analysis what we did in the horizontal analysis was comparing the two years
so, we will focus somewhat on the analyze process of addie, a lot on the design and maybe a little on the develop
for example, if ax reaches to a steady state any point; that means, it is derivative at that point is equal to 0, but if you take somewhere here somewhere here derivative if you try to find out the derivative 1
so if you take now the inverse laplace transform of the term which is there in the square bracket, it will become twenty e to the power minus t minus e to the power minus two t
so, you find out thatthis 2 are in parallel this 4 plus j 3 and are in parallel you find out say equivalent
ritual can be defined as a voluntary performance of appropriately patterned behaviour to symbolically effect or participate in the serious life
so, here i am just showing the use of; further use of the protected members, here is the protected members
yellow and blue it is the out of phase, but why it is the now clipped here why it is clipped, right
so, this is a three phase generator, sometimes we call it is your what we call it is alternator
let us see that what it means
these lines will be projected straight away; but if we are revolving it, how it looks like
we are doing this calculation at room temperature
so, it is a non current in nature
so, it will r d will up cast and think of d as if it were a b type object
so, edge so level sensitive interrupt means they need to be turned on for quite some time and edge means that some it will be any activity occurring so will get sensed
, w when i say that below and above cut off frequency, then my frequency is less than f l frequency is less than f l, my output my output frequency my amplitude will be suppressed, it will be less compared to what i see what i give as an input signal what i give as a input signal my output signal is suppressed
i have to make it sufficiently negative so that v p is slightly lower than 0 volt and then we will then the output will change ok
now, i can connect this to input to any voltage source, this is also 20 voltage source like this, this way rule 2 says, this current call it i n i and this current call it i p ok
so, when it is entering into the plus terminal sign should sign of current should be plus and when is leaving the plus terminal it should be minus
so, instead of this, what we do is we have a 200 microampure current source and we compare that to the actual drain current of the transistor, whatever that is
if it is rated for 220, i would like to go until 220 and then see that i stop, here
82 and therefore the task set can be run feasibly on a uniprocessor under the ratt monotonic algorithm
i was searching for a possible q so that i could assign meaning to it, this process is what is called as perception and the first topic that we would be taking as part of this very course is the topic called perception, the perceptual processes
we already know the formula for frr, frwhich is square root of fh into f l
in other way in other way, if you do this is v 2 , and this is also this one also you can take v 2 this parallel to this, right
in this particular case, there is a built in voltage within your p n junction and also a current that flows through the device
welcome to programming in c++
to satisfy all the equations all the time, therefore, i have to then take at their exits a y reflected also
y2 is x3 plus u2
this is this is a standard way to realize this impedance matching using a quarter wave transformer
and tthis crystal ishas atthe least piezoelectric effect, but mechanically it is robust or strongest
so once you get this, then that current reflected back, in the overhead line that i b will be is equal to minus v b upon z 1 is equal to minus in bracket minus 80
the other way of looking at the problem its purely magnetic
there may be differences in language, in location of learners are they in urban areas, remote areas, which country they are from
so this is going to be if i just take for a normal 2
and then prepare the cash flow statement, so you will get to know how much is now the cash available and then you start think uhhh thinking of the management of the cash
so, in malloc, you need to give the size in new, you do not need to pass any size
i should show this is plus and this is minus and i have to show this is plus and this is minus clearly
well, initially, initial placement is null, nothing is there
so there will be one vertex corresponding to a, b, c, d, e, f, g
and then you have follow up questions based on the answer you received from the earlier questions
it continues to operate at the priority level 2 and let's say a priority 5 task t3 executes
so, total flux is phi 1 so, phi 1 1 is the flux linkages your what you call your this coil 1 right
so let me make it by different
and what is high side and what is low side here
so, this only serves the reporting purpose
so, you have four final equations and you have four unknowns
so, this is actually a turbine model
even these markets are not freely available to the sale, maybe these private companies are existing in these markets also
without a lifecycle model the project manager is handicapped, it becomes very difficult for the project manager to monitor and control the project doesn't know that how much work is remaining and therefore the project gets delayed the cost rises and therefore for every non trivial project the project manager uses a suitable lifecycle model and the development team follows it
how much of water we are using up and can we save on water can be reduced the amount of water that we are using for construction could be very very important
so, this is signal a, which is here and in this region i am repeating again and again
so you can very well see that if i consider two revolving magnetic fields each having a magnitude of half the original magnitude of the magnetic field, peak of the magnetic field then it will be equivalent to a single phase pulsating field
raffle and engle had included proxemics
okay, welcome back
similarly, when i take this guy it is going to be this difference, those of you who rusty on this just you can do a few practice examples yourself it is not very hard
9 therefore, theta new is equal to 25
you can quickly say; first advantage is interconnecting number of individual chips
so, this mask as you see have patterns within it and other area is bright
overall within non current assets a list of asset is provided and then the description of each asset is given
there can't possibly be any amplification from the device
this is how one other reason why it is good to keep all the implementation private, not allow direct update and then control the way in which you update the values
two, two and two means they belong to the same net
and suppose we take two different strings, one of mass mu, one per meter square, other one of a slightly different mass mu, two per metre square
so, you can't say that only sales value has gone up by 20,000 and expenses will not go up by the same amount
so, once you revise all the standards in the light of the actual output, we found out that most of the variances are negative unfavorable and finally material cost variance is unfavorable then your finally you can say the price was also not favorable and your usage is certainly quantity variance is unfavorable, mix is again unfavorable and the yield is also unfavorable
in call by value, you are using separate location
many of the cells, the global placement would says that they will be mapping map here
we have to find it out
now this is the cover what is called forgetting curve and ebbinghaus came forward with this very curve now basically what he did was that on y axis he had retention and on x axis was the number of days how much of information is stored or how much of information is lost remember he was using nonsense syllables for in studies okay so meaningfulness was already taken care of all the items that was supposed to be memorized did not carry any meaning now of all these now meaning devoid information
pigeon toes make the body appear smaller forcing it into a less threatening profile
on the other hand voltage across the ideal inductor is proportional to the derivative of the current this also you have learned from your high secondary physics electricity chapter right
there are two plates, both of one is carrying charge q zero, the next one is carrying some minus q zero and they are at distance r apart, and we are suppose to calculate somewhere here its point p, and we are suppose to calculate
you need to equate it to 0 then if you solve, then you get the eigenvalues as lambda 1 is equal to 1 and lambda 2 equal to minus 1
and at the same time they do not want to dabble with so many things simultaneously and they prefer to do one thing at a time
as a customer where we should have the power to dictate the terms to the manufacturer, they were rather exploiting our sentiments and were, say, charging a very exorbitant price for the products or services they were selling to us
if i had not had the variac i would have got the torque to be v supply square divide by z square
i will also stored a in this register
this equation that i have written over here
then we can use a equal to 0, and b equal to 0 as default arguments, so that if the user does not provide values for a and b, then x will be set to 0 and y will be set to 0
now this is very useful thing because it gives us a very, very simple method by which we can follow the hydration in this chemical shrinkage measurement
but, adhd is a billion dollar industry with the number of, see the very few medicines if you remember we talked that there are very medicines for geriatric population
because human assets are not owned by the entity or by that business
in this particular example we had in this particular approach we had looked at a situation where the wall was pin pinned to begin with
but sequential a t p g tools are, in comparison, not that good in terms in the sense that they take much more time and they are often not able to detect the test for many of the faults
so, this is this switch s 1 was closed for long time
we have two half cells within a battery
so, when you found a new german philosopher coming up with his work or a german artist coming up with this work, you found quickly people translating them and that idea spreading in england
that means, channel is not there
when we are projecting this p point all the way onto this auxiliary vertical plane again the height what we are going to see is m, this is the height above the horizontal plane because it is a vertical plane and auxiliary one
will be negative; that means, the pointer will move in the opposite direction
for example, i would like to have something like this, take that, again comes pass through that
so, power required for substrate 1 will be less than power required to substrate 2
so, if it is 20 mm, locate this point
so again gypsum itself just like what happens in fresh cement paste this gypsum can go into reaction with the aluminates involving c3a or hydrated forms of c3a like mono sulphate or calcium aluminate hydrate and reform expansive ettringite and that is probably the most deleterious stage of this reaction as observed in laboratory experiments but in the field there is something different that happens i will talk about that later
and for plain stress condition, what you can calculate is average hydrostatic tensile stresses, right
so, another way, now this is i hope you have understood this
further most if you are not changing code, we do not require that the codes segments to be writable
so, if you have given such a situation, then you have class b, you have class c, you have class d, which is a specialization of class b, and then you are constructing the object of class d
so it is just opposite to the resistance r
so, both cases are possible depending on depending on the thickness of the layer and this how i set this parameter right
we want to achieve population inversion so we want excess carriers or excess electrons in the conduction band, excess holes in the balance band
so, we have to calculate the standard cost of standard mix
so, as many as i mean as much as possible we have tried to incorporate prior to the problems and understand and we have to see that whether everything in understanding is clear or not
if i want to connect them in star all beginning, i have to be connected together or all end ends have to be connected together one of them have to be connected together and the other end will come out
5 times d where d is the effective depth of the wall cross section that you are looking at or 1
this was a condition, when we have v g s equals to 0 volt, but if i increase v g s greater than 0 volt, i will see the increase in the i dss or degrade in current i d
so for any design for testability technique i have to address and find the solution to this question: how to initialize the flip flop rather easily and how to observe the states of the flip flops whenever i want to
lets come to it
values have types, and essentially the type of a value determines what operations are allowed
we have recapped that and if you just move your attention to the top, between the includes and main you find that a function pointer compare has been defined, implemented for the purpose of use by q sort
if it is something like a spiral you have r theta phi kind of coordinates which can be connected by one single parameter
so, this will be the focus of our next video
we have to choose between change and more of the same
so, in that we have already seen the how overloading works for the copy assignment operator and the same is also here and we had that noted that this overloading is very important because unless you overload the compiler provides a free copy assignment which does only a shallow copy
pecvd is nothing but plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
and time constant is c into r eq that is r eq into c, so r eq is equal to 100 ohm and c is equal to 20 milli farad, so 20 into 10 to the power minus 3 farad so it is second
so, your what you call that wattmeter reading is actually in that case wattmeter, this side is open that is secondary is open
that was, i 0 equals v i by r1
so, to win over the sentiments of the people or to fulfill the requirements of the people what you have to do here is you have to reduce the prices or keep the prices under control and if you want to control the prices of the products you will have to control the cost
so, at the very end what i will get
two golden rules understood
so, now, first let us see the first condition v i is greater than v c when v i is greater than v c by diode, , diode is in forward bias
from the more circle you can estimate what is the actual value of sigma t itself, knowing the value of the shear stress and knowing the value of the average normal stress acting on the wall
z equivalent in per unit and voltage regulation in per unit are they same
so, if i draw the resultant i have to subtract from forward the reversed and i can draw it somewhat like this
so, this is your; that means, does the resonance frequency omega 0 of the two branch parallel circuit this is one condition right, it is it is your what you call this factor has been multiplied, when the series rlc circuit is a one upon root over lc, but with this factor this has been multiplied that is i told you these are multiplied right
so, q 1 previous is the value of q 1 at this instant
and here again you see everything is already installed and the dependencies are resolved nothing else to do now to test whether octave is running properly or not just type octave you will now see a gui popping up very nice gui it looks much like the matla gui
remember we said potential should be the same everywhere because of the interpretation that this is the work done and i'll leave this is as an exercise and give it in the assessments for you to complete
precisely on major axis or minor axis, you would like to construct normal, will that be straightforwardly this one or do i have to join the lines from f 1 f 2 and bisect it
well, you see, there can be some circuits from the output of which you are driving a, there can be some other circuit from where you are driving b
so, we say difference amplifier takes the difference of 2 quantities and amplifies it this is same thing is happening and the gain in this case
so, this is about the operation amplifier, we will see in detail what are the parameters for operation amplifier, and we will correlate with lot of experiments, that what is a use what is the application of this particular operation amplifier
we have actually made an estimate of the eccentricity but this is the static eccentricity
the source was common to input and output
adc0 has 6 channels and adc1 had 8 channels
if we look at the second posture; in which a person is sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair
the flux here is lagging, whereas the flux is leading here
so, in the cost sheet the profit calculated is called as the operating profit, right
the final value theorem will be valid only when all polls of f s are located in the left half of s plane
so, mark this one as focus point
just a very simple calculation i am just illustrating
positive eye contact is important in our interaction with other people
this is my wattmeter
so, i am going to illustrate another example of persona that one of my students had covered of somebody with a child actually looking for a toilet or a bathroom in a city
so let's say you have a wall which is subjected to lateral forces and axial forces and as i mentioned yesterday, tensile heel cracking is a serviceability criterion, right
however, if somebody has to use it deliberately as a part of one’s speech, as a part of ones presentation to highlight a particular idea for example, then it would be more appropriate to use several fingers together and bending them instead of putting it in a direct jab position
so, you should always ensure that if you want to process the keys in a particular order make sure that you preserve that order when you extract the keys you cannot assume that the keys will come out in any given order
so better to use two copies of the gates, one you place closer to that, other you place closer to that ok, and you just clone like that
there are two flip flops, there are two multiplexors
so, which so all the delta y terms over here; they are going to become, they are going to tend to 0 ok
in the next lectures, we shall be talking about some of the common sensors and actuators that are very important in embedded system applications, and many of them we shall be actually demonstrating through the hands on sessions
there is a basic command called find
in case of real op amp, vd will become very, very small but not exactly zero
in today's lecture, we want to introduce a new idea called the electric field
so if you're going to be looking at an equilibrium of internal forces in both the x and the y directions, the lateral directions, we can examine the thickness of the motor joint, the thickness of the brick unit over which these stresses are acting and write down the equilibrium in these two directions
then again 8 does not divide, nine does not divide and so on
i can do a operator placement, i can do a new placement into a given buffer for an object
so number of nodes are 3, number of branches are 5
this right is conferred by the government and it is for a period of 20 years from the date of application
it depends on the pointed object
so this is the the 17,500 this is 130,000 so it means total factory cost is how much
so, our intuition is correct that this vector field has a swirl about it
so, if you still do not use any other model if you use this model even and try to find out the c with the help of this model you are doing a great job
but the advantages of bist are also quite high, so that in many applications, many chip designs, you may prefer to go for bist because it gives you much higher convenience, reduction in test cost
so, first one, now the formulas for the ratios are pretty simple, almost common sense, but let us try to calculate the important ratios and observe the trends in it
all of this if you are not familiar with, now certain companies they very strictly adhere to rgb values, believe me even for shades they have strict adherence to a shade; you cannot change that shade
so, if you cannot have any parameter and if you cannot overload the destructor which means that the destructor of a class is unique
so, d n is the value of displacement field at time instant n ok
so, new power factor
so, that is 65 for the second hole and the diameter is 10 for that
i'll call this resistor r which i'll say is 5 kilhoms and there is a diode d with a voltage vd across it
if we are considering armature reaction clearly the reaction will be non linear, it cannot be linear because the saturation will get into picture, non linearity will definitely creep in
this is a diagram as a 2 d plot of values of s minus into g s into u x
now this is the performance report
tangential boundary conditions, which states that
and that eddy current is going to cause a huge amount of i square r losses in the core
the idf is than referred to a law firm which does ip filing services and approval for cost of filing are given usually the there is a panel of ip service providers with the institute and one of the firms from the panel is identified for a particular task
so, is the equilibrium distance for the 2 hydrogen atoms in the molecule
if we said the lowest priority task does not suffer any inversions, that would be true
unknown function n i e so, can i choose this to be n i e x, is there any conceptual problem with this alright
last is infinitely fast it is very fast it has infinite bandwidth this is way when we talk about ideal operation amplifier, but practically it is limited to few megahertz practically it limited to few megahertz
these are the hatched lines
so to calculate the vector potential for this solenoid, let us now write these in terms of vectors
and in the capture mode, shift divide equal to zero and clock d
so, this is the damping mechanism which helps the pointer to settle down to its position quickly, so, that we can take readings very easily
these are the thing what these every time i am taking equilateral triangle that is conductors space
and then of course we have already examined the role played by the material strengths
that means no branches beyond any branch, right, so it is a single element
now, once you so, trust versus mistrust, they have to resolve that and move on
frequency or time
and non inverting terminal is grounded, non inverting is grounded right
same way, electricity bill hoga, rent, any other office expense, which is not paid, but is payable in the short term that will be other current liability and the last item in this head that is 4d is short term provision we have already discussed the provision so a particular liability where amount is not known with substantial accuracy is a provision but it is payable in the short term period then it is called as a short term provision so with this that is right now we have gone through one two three and four so we have finished the asset side of a detailed format in the next session we will discuss about we have completed the liability side of the format now we will next session we will discuss about we have completed the liability side of the format
however, ideally, we should be looking at cradle to grave
so, now this gradient that we have defined we do not have to always make it look like this right
then we have seen how we can slice it, what czochralski technique is or how the float zone technique is used
so, it means when you are talking about the historical cost, it means what was the cost incurred in the past, what was the cost incurred in the past and what is the expected cost that is the standard cost
she has also mentioned about successive approximation method for the design process, she has also provided some software tools to get started with the design of the e learning content
so, this is something that we should be seeing in the near future
in fact, there are many many such models
so, next is one example, so a 230 volt shunt motor with a constant main field drives load whose torque is proportional to the cube of the speed the when running at 600 rpm
and subtract these two, by subtracting these two is there any advantages that i get
124,375
the first angle projection system is very popular in european countries and also for iso standards
and the output of this pi controller is compared with a triangle
now in order to make these things to work the memory management unit in trustzone enabled arm processors is designed in a special way
and if we apply voltage between these two dc voltage between these two across these two plates, no current flows at all
so, it will start to discharge again
so, how do we determine how many paths survived this kind of block
so this is a nice tool to have
ok, so so it is not that i am blindly cutting
so, what we can say the function ft and fs are regarded as the laplace transform pair where ft and fs are the laplace transform pairs
he has remark that in turkey or in middle east handshakes may be very gentle or a gentle handshake is considered to be a positive one in comparison to that he had noted during his research in utah that you may get what is called a mormon handshake which is enthusiastic vigorous and also pretty prolonged
yet another you have a step up down or a boost converter
we will take b l is equal to 1 upon x l that is why it is minus j b l right
in the table setting of restaurants also you might be also noticed that if it is a table setting for the two, the restaurant owners normally put a small objects in the centre of the table
f is nothing but the value of 1 by capital t that is time period
so pointing vector is given by: s is one over mu naught e cross b
so, this is how the gain of the amplifier can be determined in case of the hartley oscillator
for deeper understanding on the blooms digital taxonomy, we have provided in lxt resource this week describing each taxonomic element with digital key words and their corresponding digital activities
if you remember the integration was done from 0 to h by 2 because of the symmetry
in c++, the good thing is the c++ standard library provides us with a readymade stack
that gives you a flavor in terms of both geometrical way of constructing the pictures and mathematical functions which might be using to construct that more like based on coordinate geometry rather than plane geometry, great
now alternative way of analyzing the balance star star system is to convert it into per phase because the system is completely balanced you can convert the three system to its equivalent single phase system, so when you convert the three phase system which we are discussing then you get the equivalent circuit as shown in this slide here the van that is phase voltage is connected to the load zy through the line, so one is line connecting between phase a to a of the source and load and then another line is for connection between neutral of the source and load
so, for example, layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 layer 4
whether i look at the stator or whether i look at the rotor for any position i am going to have the air gap to be uniform so it is not going to differentiate between position a and position b
when you are requiring a/d converter in the experiments that we shall be showing, we shall not be using too many channels
so, this is only when your concave your taking capacitors
so, i should have passed ampersand g, which is a pointer
web browsing and in fact, all interactive applications where we expect the result to be produced within few seconds 20 seconds, 30 second and then we say that the system is performing well
so, previous value is hold
and let me draw the flux lines also and here we will have a core
you have essentially 2 sources for the electrons; you can get the electrons from the donor level, remember the donor atoms each have 1 more electron than the silicon that is why it is an n type
so, if this is the case and if i want to design passive band pass filter, then what can i do
1 executes for two time units and at time two, sorry, time instance 3, the second instance of t1s arrives and then checks the deadline and finds that t1 has lower deadline than t2 and therefore preempts t2 and t1 starts running the second instance of t1
the final thing is at the sixth argument you have a %s at this particular point and time printf would look at the sixth argument present that is this value 0804a040 and since you have we specified a %s, so it interprets this value as an address and tries to print the contents of that address
so, z c 1 is remain same z c earlier one, one thing was not there only one 2 junction right to overhead line may be connection or one cable one overhead connection right the junction, but now this your what you call that line is bifurcated this is that is why z c 2, z c 2 in the previous expression just you replace z instead of z c 2 you right z c 2 by 2 therefore, v is equal to 2 v f the z c 1 plus z c 2 by 2 into instead of z c 2 it will be z c 2 by 2, right
the left hand side i can write as integral v grad v dotted with surface is equal to integral grad v square over the volume
then we define some variables val, flag, relay, len, we have initialized all these to 0
so, so this is what we have been using all along and we will now build a theory of what happens in realistic materials, this was not an issue for our case of yours integral equations because there i was dealing with single frequency
at different locations normal to that major axis, teeth will be arranged
so, why we have used the two units extra and whether it was because of the waste age or because of the inferior quality of the material or maybe our standards were not correct
i am expecting this o one, n one as the output
so, i have got my matrix equation a x equal to c and we have done this ok
so, if i substitute the value 2 pi r l, which is i do not know
so, let us just look into our modification before you go further
there is a built in function for this as well
and in the last module we had discussed about image filters
so, you can convert that nth order differential equation into n first order equations
so, now next is a transformer on no load, right when transformer sorry transformer on load when transformer is on load, so firstthis transformer on load
what are the parameters that you have to set to run your simulation correctly and get the correct answer
just to give you a perspective view, this 3 d object if we are having a slice and keeping this section in that direction, removing this part; then the view supposed to be like that
so, there are 2 ways it will be 2 right i am correcting it right
so, these are the points that we will cover
so this, you could ask me how were these tests carried out
because of the drops in the switch these are not ideal switches and drops in the diode you will get slightly less than 9 volts
but in this case the ideal transformer can be described using hybrid parameters
there is a status dialogue which opens, which just gives you an indication of the paths which from where it takes this is the g schematic rc file g gfc file where it is located is located in user share geda however these are in the this need route permission to modify these files however if you want to, you need to have a copy of these files in your user
so, that is giving me e y correct rate of change of e y in time and h z in space right
the delta f s s is equal to if you put it here then you will get expression for study state expression for delta pg s s that we will see later, right
so, test method a requires that you introduce flat jacks at the top and bottom of the test location and control how much of in situ compressive stress is being applied
we compile it, we save it, copy and paste
so, in the following lectures series, we will see experiments, and several parameters that we have already learnedt in the previous classes, whether it is operational amplifier you have to use a operational amplifier, as an inverting amplifier or it is a non inverting amplifier, or we talk operation amplifier as a filter or we talk operation amplifier as an oscillator
rupee 60, this unfavorable
so, we thought ok, let us increase it to 50 and when we increased it to 50, gradually we were getting more and more depolarization and to reach we were exceeding 200 milli volts depolarization
abhirami points us to another important line in the, in this consumer side, which corresponds to the routing key, equal to the binding key
so, if you apply in this circuit kvl you will get e b is equal to v minus i a into r plus r a, r a is the armature resistance right
so, if initialization of one data member is dependent on the initialization of the other, it will matter as to which data member is initialized earlier and which is initialized later
so i would rather classify these as ancient masonry units, construction units, and modern masonry construction units in the first place
and after the fc, gain decreases at constant rate as the frequency increases
this new method was developed with the help of the panoptic studio, which is a two story dome embedded with 500 video cameras
now, first of all, y21 is the forward parameter
in the case the dcdc converters the main components in it are the mosfet or igbt some power semiconductor switch
this point is c, somewhere c prime
i hope just by observing it will be clear to you that cash receipt from customers or cash paid to suppliers to employees etc
so, let us start from the top, those of you who have done linear algebra
for example, we will discuss how to analyse technology requirements, how do we map the technology affordances to the pedagogical design requirements
so, this is what pulse basis and delta testing has done to our equation
so, now you can do a timing analysis take time versus v i and time versus output, output can be either v supply or minus v supply and v i on v i axis mark these two values ltp, which is this and utp, which is the negative of this so, this is the utp
the more complex is a software, the more time effort is necessary to understand the software and find out where exactly and what change needs to occur
let me just try to just highlight
now, in the case of series motor the because series field in series with the armature, so, armature current is equal to field current right
there are buttons like zoom to area, zoom out of that plane also
field
there are several questions that you as an engineer will be faced with in that sort of a situation but if there is a possibility of extracting material and testing it in a laboratory or carrying out a test in situ that is the best option that is available to you
these are called glitches or hazards: static hazard, dynamic hazard
i told you in the previous class that the final end of the operating budget is preparing the budgeted profit and loss account or the budgeted income statement and the end of the financial budget is preparing the budgeted balance sheet
so, when you come across this kind of different indicator circuit do not get confused, they are all integrated circuits its only way they are fabricated or packaged, it can be metal package, it can be ceramic flat, it can be 14 pin, it can be more number of pins, it can be dip it can be dip plastic, right
it certainly makes the code much cleaner
so, d e by dx that is the first term to apply d e y right how do i implement this
our sole objective was to minimize the number of tracks, for example in channel routing, and we did not consider the sizing of the wires, which means we assume that we can use this smallest possible width for the wires because fan out is limited and the current flowing through these wires will not cross certain limit
for instance the slope of i1 versus v1 is y1, slope of i1 versus v2 is y12, slope of y2 versus v1 is y2, slope of y2 versus v1 is y2 and slope of y2 versus v2 is y22 2
except two conditions are there when i say what i am doing is, i am integrating over this region volume 1, that is what i am doing not the entire space right
now i have this one entry, and again i have to multiply it by this thing and that will take me for each of the columns in this i will get one entry, so that will take me 100 steps
now this is fine, this is in fact what we will use for our large signal calculations
so, when i write it as capital x i mean it as the diagonal version; that means, so this is capital x into u and this is capital u into x ok
so instead of creating the initial placement absolutely randomly, we use some intelligence to create a reasonably good placement
so, you may be wanting to know your profits, you may be wanting to know how much cash you have, you may be wanting to know how much bank deposits you have, so you want to have a final summary of the balances which represent your financial position
so, that in the vertical plane, ah top view we can see that rotation
so this, this worst negative slack, can be defined as the slack for every net timing endpoints: tau, where tau belongs, to t, where t is the set of timing endpoints
so, given a graph, i am trying to add a vertex such that its distance from any of the other vertices is minimum, not necessarily from the source vertices
basically, any message will have a header and a footer, so lets put down the header and footer
now, let us take one segment over here, so, this segment over here
so, you will see that it have only 1 impulse kind of activity in the time scale at t is equal to 0 otherwise its value is 0
so, the constructor gets invoked which is this constructor; these output
having said that, we do have a need for say broadband filters where we have to design the responses of the passband and the stop band, so for that cases, we do have some methods to realise the equivalence of lumped components
if you change the load resistor, it will not affect the filter response
now, view of previous equation which we have just see in the previous slide the state transition matrix is dependent only upon the matrix a
before we delve into the details of designing e learning based on these learner centric principles, let us do a brief digression and look at an overview of the process of designing and developing learning content, the materials, the strategies, the formats and so on
so, like we have discussed earlier which are the input bias current right, temperature compensation, power supply rejection ratio, common mode rejection ratio, input offset voltage, cmrr right common mode rejection ratio
we will also discuss the the characteristics of op amp like offset input voltage, input bias current, input offset current etc
so we have done all that and we know we look at all the water
so, it is 2478
so, this is the condition b square less than 4 ac or under damped condition, we can have a situation where theta reaches it is final value like this smoothly
so, today we discussed about the mesh analysis and particularly the case where current sources available in the mesh analysis
for example, it could be the case of one charge particle moving with speed v, in that case all replaced l by tau which is equal to this speed
so lets hope that will see something very interesting in the near future
that means the holes move slightly slower as compared to the electrons in the n mos transistors
you can see gradually it is going up from 0
because i have to write this as actually lambda 2 minus lambda 1 multiplied by whatever is the current or i may say area of the rectangle which is actually pqrs or pqsr whatever
so, let us go for it
n x dou phi by dou y minus n y dou phi by dou x, this is the x component, y component is going to give me dou phi with a minus sign by dou x and minus n y n x dou phi by dou y minus n y right
in the next case again, i may have one more which will again come closer to t max, but i have to make sure that every resistance is designed in such a way that every step they need not be equal, nobody said r11 r12 or r13 they all have to be equal, not at all
if you want to replace this text that you have seen here you could be able to remove or they too soft in your content in such a way that you include the first and second the pronouns, such as i, we, me, you, your, so that it becomes much more of a composition between you as the teacher and the student himself
rupees 8 and what is actual 8 rupees
so, d d by dt will make the same assumptions is about the medium linear homogeneous all of that
and interestingly, a namespace may be unnamed; i can have a namespace just to segregate some of the symbols and just to put them together, but not to access them from outside
so, it is the ions that are forming the bonds and the bands
now you commit an error and if the magnitude of the error considered by your parents to be able to trigger punishment you are immediately scolded; it is not that you for instance use a slang right now and after two days your father calls you and then punishes you, scold you, that does not happen
now, for each line in returned by readlines on infile, remember that when i get line from readline the backslash n is already there, if i do not do anything to the backslash n, i can write it out the exactly the same way
it is open right and this is your close ah
so, and and ah it does not necessarily mean that at the end node will the best location no right it will be some some place higher it will give you that your what to call that best minimum power loss
at a given speed may be adjusted to any desired value, for is setting the speed load characteristic has a 6 percent group that is a speed change of 6 percentage 3 hertz causes actually 100 percent change in power output
there is a high pass passive filter, that is what we are working on
now, fortunately, such a standard exists, called the boundary scan standard, which we shall be looking at briefly in this lecture
so, let us recap what we discuss in this course
so, because of the service based industry today if you see the contribution of these three sectors, services sector is contributing maximum which is more than 55 percent then is the manufacturing sector and the contribution of the say the agriculture has become lowest
because if this is 180 minus gamma, then i add all the three i should get 180 degrees
so, it will be 50
so in other words if you move a slight change from this point, any of the parameter you will see a significant change in the percentage percent change in the time to corrosion initiation, so slope of these curves about that 0 axis that is what about this origin we can say, that is what is supposed to be looked at, more the slope more sensitive that parameter will be, so in these three cases you can see that covered depth is very sensitive, then the difffusion coefficient and then the chloride threshold
as i mention due to these reasons we need to ensure the strand is in good shape to bond with the surrounding concrete
so, something like that we are going to construct
so, therefore you could actually have multiple processes like this each of them having their own enclaves but all of this processes would mapped to the same region within the ram that is the prm region
so, this is useful in the case of when we form devices on a vapor, these devices have to be connected to an external circuit and this is usually done by forming metal contacts with these devices
we said that donors which are n type dopants come from group 5
let us look at third angle projection system
so, equivalent resistance for any number of resistors connected in series would be the summation of individual resistances
so, we will have to see that if the labor hours used here actually spent on more than the standards, it means efficiency of the labor is affected negatively and that is the cause of increasing this labor cost varies
so you also must be having access to some sort of digital gadget inside classroom
so, dry stack construction is basically mortar less construction
bars are all possibly at their fs values and so you have a moment capacity but axial force capacity is zero
suppose you go to some restaurant to have, say, some lunch
in fact, it was easier than other numerical problems
so, you have to find out derive the expression for the capacitor current power and energy this is the first thing
how do we operationalize it in an e learning context
so, i want to do a multiplication for example
what i mean is let us say i have a three phase transformer here in delta like this
so, if you do this experiment on your own, you see that you will realize the aerodynamic friction, which is trying to move it which is opposing to movement
that jtag port was used primarily for testing, but now a days that same port is used for downloading the, the configuration data for f p g s, the, through the t d i, t d i input because of getting shifted inside the chip
gow we can have oscillations all right and when does from where does the starting voltage come from
in the case of ppc, the fly ash class f type fly ash is coming from a plant called the mettur power plant over a distance of 200 kilometers and this is the composition of the fly ash
this one is a visible one so, we are representing it in that way, but if we are picking bottom view from here, this is hidden
we have sufficient cash available for operations here that is 32,692 and the minimum cash balance desired here is that is 5,000s
so, we have taking this direction say i is equal to 3 ampere and this is my 8 volt and this is your 2 i right this is dependent voltage source
so all work is an opportunity for doing good for the world, jagat hitayachar for the good of the world and gaining both materially and spiritually
to understand this figure you have to imagine a bit, or look at a corner of the room and see how you can, you know, think of that as the origin and how you can think of theta phi an r direction
so, that way these things will be, what you call this, this lattice diagram can be constructed
an alternate approach to solve this particular problem is to prevent hardware trojans altogether so essentially if we cannot detect the presence of a hardware trojan we will design circuits in such a way so that insertion of hardware trojans in the circuits become difficult
these are the cones they look like cones whereas, here have the rod photoreceptors here these are the rods
i told you it is 180 volt
so, it is consider a toroidal ring
i eliminated the current source right and i got an equation in terms of phi minus phi i
contrary to popular belief, a patentability search is an effort, that is directed towards determining whether an invention is obvious or not
so, the whole idea of going in for bond patterns is to be able to create vertical stagger across the joints
and then i will have, i can protect the contact area somewhere i cannot grow insulator on that area so that is fine
so, using that argument, the rest of the curve can be constructed
then it an unrealized gain so these are not shown as cash flows they would be reconciled in cash and cash equivalent now there is so this is about foreign currency items the second is about the next one is about extraordinary items i hope you remember the extraordinary items which we had discussed
so, this whole confusion if you would like to call that in python about that fact that all ranges end one short of the right hand side of the range, stems from the fact that you very often want to run from something to the length of it in a list or a sequence or a string and when you say that you do not want have keep remembering to say minus 1
see if you are getting similar in situ compressive stresses but a modified version of the flat jack testing actually gives you a significant advantage in being able to establish the in situ stress strain curve of the masonry of the composite masonry from which you can actually establish models of elasticity and the poisons ratio
this is what we call front view; from front side, we are looking it, and if we are looking a cone from top, it might look like a circle
so the persona is in three parts one is the age of the person, second is the geography and third just for fun we will even name this person, ok
now use your roller scaler, move parallel, draw dash dot kind of line
here is the connector i was talking about, type a to mini b, and there is a red/green led
what is a consequence of having a virtual function, it has a virtual function pointer in that object and that pointer is specific to the type of the class as we have seen
but v t that is feedback signal depends on the feedback factor beta because you see again this signal depends on the feedback factor beta
so, let us see how to do that
the reverse string is output and then the control goes out of scope at this point and implicitly the destructor function is called and you can make out that the destructor function has been called by finding out that the message within the destructor function has been printed at the output
so we can share those pins for scanin and scanout, but at least one pin necessary for t c gate overhead will be ok
the third type of connection which is actually series
this column is called as debit column, dr and this column is called as the credit column which we signify with the help of cr that is the credit
if we have static allocation we can also exploit the fact that we can get peculiar random access arrays which python actually does not have
section modulus of the whole section is zpz and section modulus of the shear area will be aw into yw
table given table is v in, v out
so let us see this one by one, right, ok
now in python and in most programming languages numbers come in two distinct flavours as you can call them integers and numbers which have fractional parts
so, from here now we will talk about some of the precautionary measure what has to be taken even before you start thinking about the layout
now, coming back to this board again, you see in this arduino connector, the six analog input lines are available here, but more number of analog input pins are supported
y is going to be square root of x square plus y square
so here we have added negative as a feedback signal
let us start from the farthest back in time i need to know e n minus 1 and i need
so, base class has a function f method f derived class has inherited and then overridden this method
cash equivalent refers to short term highly liquid investments
no, but it is not so
zero or one one means output of the x node gate will be one
however, birdwhistell has questioned us that “no position or expression or no physical movement ever caries meaning in itself and of itself”
so, here you will see all the 3 resistances are in parallel
further, as many of you would know smart cards and other such low end devices can be easily cloned or copied, so, this means that i could actually clone this particular hardware, create another hardware which has exactly the same private key
so, in that case; that means, here it is in the diagram it is showing only one cloud, but wherever charge concentration is high the voltage gradient there it will be very high
so, the triangular portion will be that
and, let us learn that through an example
another check which we also require was the intra chip variation, so as we mentioned in the previous lecture the intra chip variation shows the reproducibility or the robustness of a puf
and if we simply adjust the priorities and violate the rate monotonic priority assignment, then the results that we so far heard on rate monotonic analysis would not hold
so, into 12 ampere right; so it becomes 4 ampere; that means, this i current flowing through this i is 4 ampere right
so you are going to have the droop definitely decreased previously the droop was quite high now the droop will come down because ia ra drop itself is coming down
so, if you put this put your do the same analysis that we did right toward i mean wave travelling at some non normal direction and calculate the reflection coefficients what you will find is that if i plot the reflection coefficient over here versus theta 1 and theta 2 are over here what happens is that you get nulls like this ok
for the wave which is traveling to the left, this sign will become plus
and you are only given the value of r you are only given a value of r right or that is also not given let us say that is also not given then how can you design the filter right
now when i look at this expression let us just gather all the constants outside
so, when the function returns, that is, when this value, return value x plus y is computed and given back to the caller, main, and that value is copied to z
so if i want to implement this then i need the internal information of the node, because unless i can access the info of the node i cannot print that value
welcome to lecture 21
so what would be the first step sam would be doing while taking down notes, probably take out his pen
so, v a b is equal to root 3 in to v p that means, v p is the phase voltage and v a b is the line voltage
so, i have a few best practices to help people actually make sure that they are learning a little more about their own digital styles but also using digital body language intelligently
then there are other design goals as well like power added efficiency or pae
now searchers specialize in different areas, they could be searchers who are specialized in electrical chemical, metallurgical or electronical and biotechnology
18 volt, this is the answer, right
click right click over here and to edit
so, this can really be useful and as we are going to talk about you can use the extremity of this cluster
14 we can write 10 root 2 angle minus 45 degree; that means, this one actually root 2 root 2 will be cancel it will be 5 angle 45 degree because angle 0 degree by angle minus 45 degree it will go up plus sin
and z0 is called as the characteristic impedance
depending on the connectivity we try to create ah the clusters and we grow the clusters in size iteratively, one by one
so, now it will be only the amount is how much
this code may not work on the virtual machine that was given to you along with the course and you may to tweak up this program a little bit and in order to get it run on your ubuntu machines
so, the conductor sides cutting flux
using angles, coordinates also we have shown the dimensions, something like if there is an inclined object with respect to coordinate system this one 2
although you can invert the mathematical relationships, you can't arrange a circuit in the converse direction
so, this is setting these currents are setting radiating in empty space
both of these are for basic circuit analysis and for laplace transforms there are nptel courses like networks and systems available at this url
and each time there is a interrupt from the periodic timer
so, if the ladder were to move at the same speed at the magnetic field the induced voltage e, the current i, and the force would all be 0 because relative speed will be 0 right
it will be the same value there will be no these 2 tents will come and meet at the same line there will be no jump over here, because of the way we have constructed it
if you do that then the compiler will give you an error and in this case i have shown the error from one compiler, which says that f has missing default parameter for parameter three that is for this parameter
this lag in the output voltage, we can see using the oscilloscope, alright
if that is so, we are not considering the in the axil force equilibrium, the contribution from the compression reinforcement is not added
therefore t d y t over d t, one over v two, where v two is the velocity in the right string, plus one over v one, d y t over d t, d y i over d t and this should be zero
so we have two parameters: t v i plus t e i
n v we can do the same for the valance band edge 2 pi m h star over k t by h square whole power 3 over 2
so, therefore, this triangle your what you call if you make it is a your what you call that your write this your this triangle if you consider, i mean this portion and this portion if you consider
so, these are some important factors which help the companies to increase the sales, sustain the sales and to know in advance that as a cause and effect relationship, maybe cause is the reduction in the price, increase in the income level of the people, very strong advertising campaign or changes in the preferences of the people, how they are going to impact the demand of the total market with regard to one particular product and what market share one company can expect
so, it's a word the r is really a, it's a conglomeration of several phenomena, and it's called the response reduction factor because exactly what it is doing is reducing the response for us as far as design is concerned, but in earthquake engineering literature, this is referred to as the behavior factor
if you make the constructor private then nobody can call it, and therefore, you cannot have any instance of that class
you cannot see anything through the mask except the area which is transparent; that means, this field is dark
so, we'll have to find out that what are the conditions given in the case here
so as you change the position, they also change
net result is that if the credit side is bigger than the debit side though, difference is called as gross profit and if the reverse happens that debit side is bigger than the credit side, then we are in the state of gross loss
because of which if i actually look at the speed torque characteristic
so, what does that mean by controlling the area
however, i re read that this was a transitory phase
maybe there is two courses per teacher, so that could also be part of your system
we looked at yesterday how the pm interaction curves for in plain bending of masonry walls, reinforced masonry walls, the set of expressions can be developed with the working stress approach consideration and we looked at four different zones for the interaction curve
so, and your what you call, easily you can compute i because this will act this will act as a open circuit
then it will be easier
we can still do some further optimizations
there we try to construct different views like vertical plane projections, horizontal plane projections and also, we tried to have feeling for cylindrical objects, the views created by that
and it should be appealing and easy to remember or recollect
you have to think about that now the market has changed
now, for serial communication; so, there is a register for serial control register or scon register in this sm0, sm1, sm2; so, they are the mode specifier
so, we saw that as a structural typology, masonry is one that is efficient under compression and that is utilized quite a bit
so, we have 0000 0000 and this should be actually filled with the address of mylib int
so this signal flow graph property will help in finding out the transfer function of the system more easily
if i give you another example and quickly let us see: if i want to understand the process flow for designing a gas sensor
so, it is minus v 2 plus v 3 minus 3 is equal to 0, this is equation 3, right
now, this is my complete amplifier and i will explain this later
these are all channels
that is what it is going to do
so actually solution here is no big deal, you can actually boil it down to how might we reduce the number of courses that he enrols, so that he shows up on time in class
so, that is early calculus and mostly for mechanics problems
with this discussion we will just stop here and continue discussing a few more lifecycle models in the next lecture
so, it will rotate in the clockwise direction and this conductors are placed in a slots
what topics
so, as long as your wire is very thin, this is exact
if it is looking at this version, if it is looking at this version, that means, that it is looking at complex, so this is how the generated function will look like complex x, complex y return then x greater than y question mark x y right
you see that it is not only b is same, this address of b is also same; because what has actually been returned, what has been returned is not the value of x
25 which we can find out from table 5 of is: 800 2007 so we can find out the value of gamma mb from table 5 and we can find out the design shear force sorry design bearing force next will come bolt in tension so for tension we can calculate the nominal capacity of bolt in tension as tnb is equal to 0
now, to get i o c this is sorted right i mean this, this 1 and 2 is sorted now because we have to get i o c
28 kilonewton now if we take if we take moment about this line then we can find out p1 as t into y by d minus p2 by 2 right t is acting at its cg this is t this is t is acting and this distance is the cg distance right and now this is basically y ok and if you consider this is d so from these we can find out p1 as so 303
moreover, when we examine how these entities were structured, governed and regulated, we find that they bear many similarities to modern day corporations
2 henry and this equivalent resistance was 1 ohm right and this is your i l this is your i l , that means current is flowing i l like this right so and this is this parallel equivalent is your 1 ohm that circuit i have not drawn ah, but just showing you and this is the 0
the tx is connected to port d2
now if we consider a micro strip line which is as we said in the previous class that they are the pvc boards so this is our pcv boards without top metal line like this then if the width of this line gradually varies then the impedance or the characteristic impedance of this line will also gradually vary
u 2 is the global name i am giving to it
so it will have a falling time constant like this
traditionally in this seventies and eighties, area and delay were the most important parameters
similarly, if i have a as a friend of b, b is a friend of c from within these classes that does not imply that a is a friend of c, so the transitivity does not work
so, you notice the slight difference in approach is started write in the beginning, in the surface integral approach i went for each region separately solved separately subtracted
it will be the same phenomena that overhead that there will be traveling wave
so, i also have electrodes on the other end, but these electrodes do not cover the entire surface because the light has to penetrate through your device
noise if you have any idea about statistical statistics, noise is known as a noise is a random process
so, basically this one will be 1 upon 6 into 6 that is your 1 ampere right and i told you the direction is a upward
i want this to be positive if this has to be positive then necessarily te has to be greater than tl, cannot help it
so, think of the impedance z cd what is z cd
now the delta sigma y is then is then equilibrated by the shear and that's how we are establishing a relationship between the two
so, what these do is corporate governance practices is an attempt to align the interest of each other, to tell them that don't fight, have such a mechanism or arrangement or process where all the stakeholders benefit
if we hold and open and positive attitude towards other people, our feet our head and torso points to the same person in a single clue and this position gives us an understanding of the attitude of other people towards us and vice versa
now, it is not necessary for overloading
here it would be i 2 equals to i 1 v 1 by r 1
was that what was that relation between i mean if you remember was c delta t by delta s delta x is equal to delta y this was in the case of 2d what was it less than equal to
so, both points are on the same side of that maximum sag
so, i minus g d is also invertible right and it has a unique solution right
inside the medium inside the medium yes that is a good point right
the reason being because this is something which is kind of you wanted to you know, do it very cleanly you do not to mess up things here
if i am writing in terms of even instantaneous voltages
so, the armature reaction is the reaction of the main field flux to the flux produced by the armature conductors which are carrying current
so as far as design for shear is concerned, we are really beginning with an estimate of what is the actual shear stress that is expected on a masonry wall
so, this part will be the load resistance right therefore, if we put that this is my x 2 dash this is my r 2 dash rotor resistance
do not take your peak value right
so in over all in past few modules we had extensively discussed the various aspects of filter design
depending upon how much is the series field influenced on the overall flux, that will decide whether the speed will come down almost to 0 or whether it is going to remain somewhat higher, yes
so over here for the example you see that we have poured 0 for this particular switch and therefore it switches the blue line to the bottom and the red line on top and so on
and when you call van v b n, v c n, it is line to neutral that is a phase voltage, and this called line to line voltage v a b, v b c, v c a
after constructing a 1 b 1 a 1' b 1' let us call this one distance 80 mm and this one 45 mm and this one 60 mm, ok
ok, so i show you an example of how a researchers have struggled with that and that we will
so in general, if you just again look at it, whatever i have said, that if there are two blocks like this, lets say b one and b four, in general, so you have the inter connections, the weight will be
red doesn't get scattered that that much, so therefore it comes directly to you, thank you
you have formula which is v in, v in equals to v in equals to what
so fin fet can go down to much small of feature sizes
so if you have masonry walls where the width of the wall is less than four times the thickness of the wall, these are typically classified as columns
though there is no physical connection between the inverting terminal and the ground
i would like to save the drawing, then naturally i have to go file save as
as far as permissible shear stresses are concerned, the code distinguishes between beams that you might be designing reinforced beams that you might be designing and walls and again distinguishes the walls based on whether you're looking at slender walls or squat walls and allows an estimate of the permissible shear stresses
so, what we have what we have looked at is how to take your absorbing boundary conditions and implement them in fdtd and for that we need to take care of our very initial conditions right
other than that, for information sake, you can have a subject matter expert sme led videos or you can have webinars or simple podcasts
it means an unstable circuit, a circuit that can produce an output even without an input
so, sputtering or evaporation or in general thermal physical vapor deposition is usually done in a vacuum
so, ammeter reading will of course, be i if this current is i 2 then, so ammeter reading is i 2
so, before we go to input of sir current, let us see the input bias current in terms of the experiment alright
so, engineering approximations are always done so that finally what you obtain as experimental values somewhat coincide with the actual calculated values, then you say your assumptions are okay, that is all, right
we have referred to the global headline when the usa first lady michelle obama hug the queen, the similar situation is exhibited in this photograph where the pakistani president mister asif ali zardari is holding hands with the iranian president mister mahmoud ahmadinejad
borrowings are various types of loans taken by you
so, i have to reverse the direction of cut by clicking this position
so, the severity of the surge depends on how well the substation is shielded right; that means, you have to protect the substation insulation level of the substation structure, and the incoming line insulation
now, we have to draw projectors to this b passing through b 1, a 1, let us call c 1 is not' b 1, a 1, c 1, and d 1
from this formula, n is equal to square root of 6m by n
or not; so, it is the adults, the parents
so damper bar gets that name because they damp out any oscillation in the speed, it is going to make sure that it is going to aid the rotor always goes towards synchronous speed
it will be a huge economic burden, so we have a huge task today in making sure that these existing and new structures will actually be able to meet the desired service life or in short they will be durable enough
and the third one which does not have a half there
certainly
because there is no sub superscript referring to which element or whatever right ok
if we write i dt right, so if we right i dt then plus then t 0 to t then i dt this way you can write
there are normally two sources of errors that i can think of
and whatever the total profit comes, if you divide by that 15,000 units, you are able to calculate the per unit profit, right
all right, then if i apply the gauss's law, e, dot, d, s, we contribute only from the two base or the upper surfaces of the cylinder and field inside e
material cost variance, material price variance, material usage variance, material mix variance and material yield variance
5 into r plus tf because it will disperse with 2
subsequently, whenever you will call this particular static member function, you will find this to be non zero
the problem will come if you are using dynamic cmos logic, like pre charge logic or something like that, then this spikes might be discharging some of the voltages, which otherwise is important, but because of these glitches and this noise, delay might increase
you need to ensure that performance is assured
embed
simulated expressions are most commonly studied forms of micro expressions
so, you can see the passive high pass filter and low pass filter these are connected together
now you can also have this transfer of control depending on some condition
now, if you apply fleming’s left hand rule, the flux lines are reversed the current is reversed
so, basically the circuit i am trying to make it like this; this is 2 right
now if you think of the electrochemical series, we have, at the very top we have gold
now, sinusoidal current is usually referred to as alternating current
so, here n hat is equal to r hat r minus r prime because r is here r minus r prime is always going to be like this r prime is fixed to be the centre of this semi circle that is the point that is fixed the testing point
similarly, if another student chose option c which also may be the wrong answer he would get feedback saying why option c is wrong and that may not be the same reason as the earlier as option a and he should get feedback which says which helps him go from the reasoning for option c to towards the correct answer again this path or these resources may be different
here in this case, we considered states for the controllability
but, we have been frequently dealing with the block and function scope, particularly in c; and, also the file and global scope in c
that means if i have a heavier string on the right hand side which makes me too smaller, i am going to have a phase change for the reflected wave
what are the 7 piece of bank marketing so here the product so what is the product the deposits loans consultancy investment international banking demat account online and mobile banking mobile wallet credit and debit card we see there are so many products for banks
however, if you have openings, if you have openings then the possibility is that it won't behave like a cantilever, it will start behaving closer to a shear deformation profile and the peers will now start undergoing double curvature
so, he is placing this in npn to start with, and he can see some value which is around 145, 131, 0, 7 keeps on fluctuating
and in that case, we will subtract that, that our requirement for the current month is 600 units
according to edward hall, whose an anthropologist he found some very consistent zones of personal space in his research across many different cultures
so, what will happen when i want to call delete on q then it has to decide based on what is the type of q, is that is what the compiler we has to see
this is the upper bound of utilization actually
what is the best way i can really construct that surface
so, the here every where downward everywhere it is upward
if you pay interest on your debentures, interest on lease, all these will be considered and included in finance costs
and the last one, delta x, v e and delta y v e denote the pin offsets from the center for vs pin connected to e, so from the center where the pins are located
so, mister joe is a biology teacher
so, i am not reading or not telling further everything is written here right and only thing is that here in this case whenever it is your dependent on the current so, this parameter this 3 you will call the gain parameter right
those were the kinds of creative
a most of the operational amplifier use differential amplifier as the input voltage the 2 transistor of the differential amplifier must be biased correctly, but practically it is not possible to exact match exact matching of 2 transistors
now, there when you see that mass moving then you will see the friction also coming into the picture
so, that's the first thing that we will examine and of course move on to a possible nonlinear stress strain relationship that can be assumed in the cross section and if that becomes our basis, the force displacement coming out of the analysis can be different
so, there should not be any problem in terms of this so, if i do that and keep it in a pointer of a class then i have done an up cast, so it should be valid
let us say i have silicon, now silicon is an impurity in gallium arsenide
what it means is that as it moves it remains pity must the same
so in that case, the as long as there is at least one uncontrollable state the system is said to be not completely controllable or we just call it as uncontrollable
epsilon 1 is equal epsilon 2 mu 1 equal to mu 2 that help me to get rid of all of these factors over here, but where is the how is the medium 2 different from medium 1 i fixed even over here i even fix these guys to be the same where is the free knob
besides that, you could take promotions and conversions
however, the earthquake does not distinguish between a structural component and nonstructural component
so, please keep in mind these conventions of standard library headers
if we change this function as follows we made x not an integer, but a list for example and we asked y to pick up the 0th element in the list and then later in f we change the 0th element of x to 22
n is popularly known as the terms ratio of the transformer
that if you take that v is equal to, first we have to understand leading and lagging and then will come to this
then student taking down notes
and, also i can put a starting value to be more precise, more mathematically precise, where y 0 is this y 0
we generally approximate with 3 different types of friction
it is 15, so in this case what will happen the circuit will be like this
but i can have some additional members also like the info d that i am putting in here, which is a member of d and was not a member of b; so, this will exist only in this
they are sitting on top of the running foundation which is a running foundation of the masonry load bearing walls themselves but you would actually have a plinth beam which helps in connecting the steel reinforcement of the tie elements to the foundation element itself
9, fly ash a median size of 17
you, vertically, do a partition, partition the x with respective to the x median
on the other hand the attacks that we would actually look at today are known as non invasive active attacks
the point is positive photoresist will help us to retain the similar pattern which is on the mask
so on the left we see ah board which consists of: this is a system, lets say system, which consists of two boards and each of this boards consist of some chips
so, the main message is that you should focus on learning programming
so, power supplied is it is taken minus 40 watt and your power absorbing that is 16 watt, here it is 9 watt
this better quality control means the steel is basically factory product, so its quality is maintained uhh in a better way in with respect to concrete material
you add this third term in your control expression, one will be proportional to the error that is your p, one will be proportional to the derivative that is d, and here one will be the proportional to the cumulative error that is i; the 3 taken together is called pid controller
so, e b you know v minus i a r a, but keep it in your mind also this drop has to be subtracted minus delta e, you may right such that, there should not be any small error
so, that is why i wanted to show it you to you that this is the process which we use to to form the silicon substrate, all right
so, in terms of all the time indices which is the future most time index over here in equation one
so all those 15 attributes are categorized into these four categories
we can write a similar equation for m h star; we saw that earlier during question 2
but, one thing you will notice over here is that the address for mylib int which was supposed to be over here is filled with zeros
it is a help you to understand the principle of this dual slope integrator; dual slope voltmeter
so, here it is r is actually ampere turns per weber, and p is the reciprocal of r, the reluctance it will be just weber, this unit will be weber or ampere turns of this physical permeance of the magnetic circuit right
so, you can have it for unary operators
g21 is v2 by v1
now, if it is an unsorted list when we add something to the queue we can just add it to the list append it in any position
so, this is the case of hindalco limited
let me take a cross section across which the current is flowing
and, make sure that your remote users are also able to you know get access to your products, and sure that that is there
so compared to that, generally the transformer will be designed for supplying a very large amount of load
of course you will have to, from this, reduce the effect of eccentricity of the load itself and that's the part that you see
so if id is more than i0, that is the actual drain current is more than the desired current, then we must reduce vgs
so, you wonder what is going on over here
so, that definition says that it is done in the in the global scope, i say that this is the name of the variable myclass colon colon x, class name colon colon variable name
so, inheritance will mean that all properties and operations of each one of the base class will be inherited and they can be suitably overloaded or overridden
so, all these questions you want to find out
now, we had a discussion on boundary conditions and we have seen that the for example, the radiation boundary condition we have used its in exact
4 kilonewton due to tensile as 179
this is the 19,000
the additional planes of projection other than three principal planes of projections that is of a front view, top view and right side or left side views, which will show true lengths are called these auxiliary planes
therefore, a x at r is going to be equal to mu zero over four pi integral of j x r prime over r minus r prime d v prime
so, at this grid point what do i do
so summer is basically used for either adding or subtracting the variables
and with that you should minimize on, if actually i would advice that you completely remove any use of c style casting in your code, just rely on these cast operators
so, this course we will not focus too much on the develop phase maybe a little bit and almost not at all on the implement and evaluate; actually a little bit on the evaluate, but not so much on the implement, but we just for completion sake of completeness, we will go through these phases
similarly here directly you will get it what will be i 2; i 2 will be your basically if you add 6 2 and 8 all are in series
you realize that a is able to make a profit of 65 on sales of 650
now this is often the case when we need to optimize implementation, we might come up with an inefficient implementation and then optimize it
so, out of 3875 adverse variance, to the extent of 2187
now, what procedure we followed previously we will just use that procedure
arm7 was one of the previous generation microcontrollers
so, its e is equal to 1 and for e is equal to 1 that is this guy which is at the left or right node
so this is going to be i line
it essentially saves r14 and some other registers which i may be needing
it is in ac mode, we can we can see the change, right
first position is for the channel one, second position is for channel 2
now if you see the circuit these two legs are in parallel so you can further simplify then the parallel combination of 5 and 3 plus j 4 will be simplified to say z1
so, this is a very important distinction
total number of hours is the labor, actual number of hours is 2,000 and this is the one component and you multiply by the rate here rate given to us is 20 14 and 10 so it means if you multiply this 400 600 and 1,000 by 20 14 and 10 this will become the actual cost of the labor so this one component will be answered that is the finding out this component that is the actual cost of the labor is not difficult at all
we will discuss few more parameters in the next few lectures
we assumed that interconnection delays are negligible as compare to the gate delay
now what will happen, if i add a and b enum as you know is the sub range of int, so if i try to add one enum with another naturally there is no separate addition of operation for enum
so we will consider the c s plus point and b s minus so vcb will be the potential across the potential coil because we consider b as a reference point for the connection of the watt meter coils
so, essentially what the attacker is going to do is that he is going to change this return address the valid return address present in the stack with a pointer to an attack code
then the next is you will have to consider the effect of casting on the operands, certainly since we have not discussed about casting i am not in a position to elaborate more on this, but while you discuss casting we will refer back on this
this is another cross section is the same thing right just the material is different
because, we will go for mean your what you call assuming that is uniform cross section, so your mean follow the mean flux path
now this scan
we are measuring the output of the differentiator so, as you can see on the screen right
so, the work of providing lateral restraint to such constructions again comes back to these massive peripheral walls
so, that is why doctors will say do not get too many x rays done you know you know given period of time, because the more you expose to x rays the more the genetic mutation can happen
so, for communication we can also use bluetooth, radio communication or near field communication
so, if you take tan theta 1 that is tan 49
that is a beautiful understanding
it is convenient of course, it is quick also it saves time and it is cost effective also
if the compression level were to approach the crushing strength of masonry, under the action of lateral forces and gravity you will have flexural compression failure
i showed you and power and energy right
so, if we are going to construct any 2 dimensional things
so, this indicates that the frame size squarely divides the major cycle
what did we do rather
cancelled or equal to the scattered field inside the object that does not mean that the field inside is 0, it just tells you that this balance of these impressed currents as they called is such that outside the object it produces the correct field; inside the object it cancels the incident field
so the flat testing, there are two types of flat jack testing you will appreciate the differences between the two types of testing depending on what you are actually looking for from the structure
so, if i give you two vectors over here say a and b with some angle theta between them ,we all know the inner product of these two vectors is; what would you write it as
so the other winding if i show again a dot here that means if i call this as positive with respect to this, this will also be positive with respect to this
in case of force current analogy the number of displacements will be equal to number of node voltages
5 kilo hour
just for the purpose of your that giving you some feeling that they are waveform right
so, we cannot say that 'i' has the type int forever; 'i' will have a type depending on what it is assigned
so, k h is characteristic constant of your core material, n is equal to steinmetz exponent, range 1
we show that same plot on the left
i can write this as a delta r minus x, not x
so, you now know the field on those points ok
so, you should always separate this out that headers which are common functions, macros, constants, manifest constants that are to be shared between source files
once that projected length is available we use the same projected length, but with a 45 degrees because is making one of its sides with its surfaces 45 degrees inclined to horizontal plane
20 into total actual time is we have to go for looking at the actual time
so, in today's class, we have covered drawing instruments and lettering of these drawings
the other part is that the components are very cheap
then we looked at the product b and in case of the product we when we calculated the mpv we have found out that this variance is favorable and by a huge amount of 575 rupees
so, now we are going to form a junction between this metal, which has a work function, which is greater than the work function of the semiconductor
sometimes, you know i think that people have the illusion that because we see such rapid advances in things like microelectronics and things like that
next similarly, the same same question was there for when 2 capacitors were in series right
but if it a very high capacity motor the current carried will also be large, so i have to make sure that i square r losses are not too high and i should not have very low efficiency, generally large capacity motors retain to design with a better performance
then comes the process oriented theories that try to explain what intelligence says and the lead person here was jean piaget
9 kilo ohm ok
the point that i am making here is that in both the cases, one thing that we have seen is the silicon dioxide, which is grown on the substrate; the substrate being silicon
and if we are seeing carefully because this is 70 mm major axis, so the diameter of this entire circle itself is 70 mm
so if i compare an electric circuit and magnetic circuit, i should say on the one side let me write electric circuit, on the other side, let me write magnetic circuit, so if i say that in this particular case, this is going to be emf, in this particular case, it is going to be mmf
and what we have seen in this particular implementation are three things rather, we have seen how to put a comment in our code, we have seen that python allows this kind of simultaneous updation of two variables at the same time so m comma n equal to n comma m
284 ampere, so the total energy stored in the coupled inductance can be given as w equal to half l 1 i 1 square plus m i 1 i 2 plus half l 2 i 2 square
when the demand is too high as compared to the capacity various tactics can be used to reduce the demand during peak periods as illustrated in figure uhh and discussed below communicate with customers an approach to shifting demand when it is too high is to let customers know the periods of high demand customers can be requested to visit the facility at periods of low demand modify timing and location of service delivery longer operating hours shh suiting the requirements of customers can be a method of shifting demand moreover locating facilities like banks and theatres to supermarkets or hypermarkets can also help in smoothing demand for these facilities offer incentives for non peak usage incentives can be offered for beginning of season or end of season usage
we want to do so because you may have noticed by now that e is a vector quantity
ok, so cantilever, essentially
see, the idea is simple
in this case what we see we see that vds is equals to vgs minus vc
and, then faraday finally, had this an equation which related the electric field to the magnetic field, but still it was not these were at that time these equations were not just 4 equation, but they were written in some different format there were plenty of them
now, with respect to addition and subtraction in binary these two make no difference
so, then you can say that it is a linear element; in general a circuit is a linear if it is both homogeneous and additive right
it is one thing is that is the budgeting process from top to bottom
one way we can think about it is that if these values are lower than the influence of the lattice is less and so you have higher conductivity
c is the constant of proportionality which is known as capacitance of that capacitor
so i think that part is editing, doing the editing part, review part
why are we assuming its a lti we are
many look like h, may not look like x, but it will be a tree nevertheless
no, you have simple harmonic compilations
welcome to module 21 of programming in c++
first step is you have to go to developer
so, the error signal equal to frequency deviation delta f or speed deviation delta omega is equal to omega minus omega r is it will be is amplified and integrated to produce a is amplified means this gain is there
quantity is equal to k, magnitude in y direction
we won't go into those details
so now, that we have done this let us try to convert equations 1 2 3 using our central difference idea
now, click again
so sandwiched coils and concentric coils, these are two ways of reducing leakage reactance
i will have if i assume that it is rotating in anticlockwise direction
so, the op amp will try to increase it is output further
so, at this point, so, now you apply the nodal analysis
so, following assumptions are made for an ideal transformer
so, you can see you can change the selection, you can bring it or you with this mode button, you can change it, right
so what would be the value of this element
so, it will be basically v minus v s upon r plus c dv by dt are is equal to 0
so, once we are done with p' q' and p q which is also 60, the projected ones
that if the voltage gradient it becomes at 5 to 10 kilo volt per centimeter; surrounding earth you will be ionized and at the time what will happen
ok, constrained pin means such timing constrained must have to be satisfied for the input data
how do i testing
at the beginning, i have said that we can do a transformation from lowpass to high pass prototypes
so, let me draw the scale of the instrument and i have a pointer
it will be identical accept that there is no incident field term that incident field term came as the integral of the current
so if the wires are separated widely, say, here the biggest dot shows s equals to infinity
yes, i do carry a notebook which is where i write my stuff which is important and relevant to me
there are two items given here
this guy right, this guy is unknown
so with this we will actually wind up this particular lecture, so we had seen in this last two lectures about how heaps are managed and how you could actually use vulnerabilities in the program such as a double free vulnerability to exploit the heap, thank you
so, if i socially done everybody will try
you realized that species which have more and more genetic variations they survive
she says take the real part ok, common mistake; now that is not enough
i will just repeat this once more
i mean every country launches its remote sensing satellites to sense the earth right
then ql comes out to be equal to this where phi r comes from this equation that we had earlier derived
so as it is written here that there are basically two reasons why actual results might differ from the master budgets, right
and every month we get the bill for electricity on the 10th of next month
if we come back to the slides on the, if we come back to the slides, written slides, the cp is given by this expression and the value of c2 is given as s22 delta s11 star
open the new one, then we click the new one
so, the example on the left hand side you see that three slider bars are one below the other with brightness contrast and volume together
but the issue is that if you look in to the available cad tools that there in the market, we will find that there are many such available tools
so, you get 1 2 3 peaks you get
so, it is concerned with accounting information that is useful to managers, not everything
22 plus j 0
vgs minus v t is one volt because of this one volt excess voltage there will be a formation of the channel this will be the width of the channel
so, let us see this experiment so, again we can see on the breadboard which is right over here, right
it is discharging only because this transistor is on and it is on only when this is high
therefore natural response v n is already expressed in section 6
these are arbitrary points
there are certain points to be noted that in that mq2 gas sensor there is a heater inside the sensor
and material is only removed from here, but not from center line
so this model, build and fix model is a very, very informal model, suitable only for projects where which is rather trivial like a student assignment
so it is g, b
so, this way also represents that there is a circle and the diameter is 7
now if current through the load r is the output and in one case when you apply vs equal to 10 volt we get current as 2 mpi
so according to the gausses law we can write: and length of this surface is capital l, the radius cylindrical selling is capital, r in the radius of gaussian surface is smaller
now we will move to question number six
if we listen to a person and nod as a sign of “yes, i understand or i am listening, please continue
we should ideally have o1 as the complexity because if the tasks are more and the scheduling points occur very frequently every few microseconds or so, then the runtime overhead becomes significant
so, tm polarization, you would take the different conventions for electric field and i will again i will just write down the final expression ok, you will notice a symmetry between these expressions
now, whatever is wsc this is the 3 phase power
so, this is the point and let us name this one as 1
so, this particular section is known as the relocatable table
so, neurons are if you see this picture
first what we have to do, draw a xy line; x axis y axis
and if these are cylindrical kind of objects center lines are there; then cut plane line always have a precedence, compared to axis or center line
so, current will be i is equal to v by r is equal to 30 by 5 is equal to 6 ampere
so in the process we will also be talking about applications, right
so, when i add them
if i remove that, we have this material, material is there
65 ohm and this one xe 1 x 1 plus k square x 2 will 6 plus 3 square
what you see here is the instrumentation that is typically required
so, this incident yeah you are ok
now one other property of noise figure if we have a cascade of networks, say 2 networks, this has a noise figure value of f1 and available gain value ga1
if i were to introduce more and more steel in the cross section, then basically it's after cracking that you will see increased capacity in the wall
so that makes it the basis on which you can test your ideas, so that is list of assumptions for you
at each centre there is going to be some value of magnetic field h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 ok
he has suggested that this time preference is like a room in which some people are allowed to enter while others are kept out of it
note the hatch directions where material is present; because section is considered only here, but not inside of that circle, that is a reason circle is complete
here i will give the input signal maybe not directly maybe through this flip flop
i'll just show the last slide again
i am essentially looking at very very thin rectangular sheets, each of them stuck to another rectangular sheet behind that, all of them will have the same dimension, only thing what i will ensure is between the first sheet and the second sheet, i put an insulator layer
now, also s is equal to s max 2 in that case if you do so, then s is equal to it will it will become r 2 dash upon x 2 dash
35 was the opening stock, 795 was the material used from the purchases
so, we are assuming that as with almost all real life problems the there are no magnetic materials around ok
square bracket actually yeah square bracket should not include the
since v 2 equal to 0 and this is also equal to 0; so, that means, v n will also be equal to 0, because we know for this circuit, virtual sorting works we have seen that
so, if i do not want to consider acm into vcm in practical situation then i cannot just ignore acm into vcm
so, in essense, all that delete requires us to do is to reassign the pointer from before the deleted node with the pointer after the deleted node
i am good never mind
so, this behavior if you look at then this behavior is already very clear to you
similarly, we have an extra material and taper kind of thing then naturally we will have this portion
similarly, this 1 2 ampere currents source and another 5 ampere in the same it is not valid because it is a simple circuit
so, we can understand this with the help of this figure in which at one port that is input port we are applying the voltage and at the output port we are adding the ammeter to find out the value of current
we have seen at depth an example of a max function which we first wrote in the templatized form used it for int and double and then we specialized it for c strings and then we showed that it will work also for user define types like complex
gastronomic tradition is dependent on culture and it is an unavoidable tool for learning about cultural differences
sometimes we may have only capacitor run motor
the load changes by 1
so, the first equation, it gave me some term a 1 1 u 1 plus a 1 2 u 2, did i have any u 3 and u 4 terms
that means, that this equation 36 actually this is equation this is your equation this is your equation this is your equation 36
now, depending on the kind of the functional block, the total time you take to generate the output can be unequal, like the example that i will take
you have gain on y axis; you have frequency on x axis
so for interconnections, there are three pins
and so this, this, this line, this forms one boundary and all over the place, up infinity, ah, let me just make it up to infinity
so even if you are given a secondary winding in delta you would again like to convert everything into per phase quantity and that is how you will draw the overall equivalent circuit of the transformer and when we are converting delta into per phase
so, z p is equal to z p angle theta, then z p conjugate will be z p angle minus theta, this is magnitude right
so, in the next module, we will see how we can solve the differential amplifier
so, essentially any data which is to be executed from the enclave is going to be stored in the ram in an encrypted state
they will mostly be programmable and for that some knowledge about technology is very important
now, certainly you would be curious to know as to why we are creating these two static and dynamic type concepts, and how they will be used, so that will unfold after maybe another module also when we actually show applications of how the dynamic type is really very critical to do object oriented programming
now the question is what happens when delta x and delta t are finite ok
however, it takes an optional argument end equal to string which changes what we put at the end, in particular if we put an empty string it means that it does not start a new line, so the next print will continue on the same line
now, we will move on to
i think you have got it, right
tree is one kind of sub graph which is important for our circuit analysis and it is form by removing a branch from the graph
this is a composite tree which consists of horizontal and vertical slices, as well as this wheel
so, this implies that if it is so that v a n plus v b n plus v c n is equal to 0
so let us let me explain this with the help of an example
because we do not want to again start the dc motor from 0 speed bring it up to 1500 rpm and so on so forth
so, it appears over there and electric field is unknown u
so, if you put it it will be 10 i is equal to 40 your i is equal to 4 ampere ; that means, if you put i is equal to in equation one it will be v 1 is equal to 16 volt, because v 1 is equal to plus if your ah 4 i
now let us look at a realistic 2d computational domain, i am exaggerating the pml thickness
the language which we use and, all it is very i mean the, that we it is
so, does it look like a fredholm or volterra
so, given this p pointer p b pointer f or p d pointer g the question that we want to ask as to which particular function will get bound by with this call
so if you correlate that ohm's law with this particular equation, you can easily say that this is something which resist the flow and that is why it is called inductive reactance in case of inductor
till then take care, i will see you all in the next class, bye
so, lime motor, most of your existing buildings if you are going to be doing an assessment you should know that might have been made with mud motor or lime motor or a combination of the two in many cases where the mud acts as a pozzolanic additive to the mortar itself
so, we know v bn is equal to v an angle because angle minus 120 degree because, it lags by 120 degree, just relationship we have to use
so if you can reduce the number of faults, fault simulation can run faster
because t force priorities increased to that of t 1, t 2 and t 3, t 4's priorities increased to that of t 1, t t2 and t3 will be prevented from using the cpu
finally, this del squared operator this is acting only on unprimed co ordinates ok, so, when it encounters any function of r prime it is a constant right
so, if you repeat the same objective infinite times, you will get always the control output provided you have some unconstrained controlled connected to the system
it will look, search for there, then see this and then set the path, environment path
now, among the special registers, these three registers are mandatory
so, if i try to measure the voltage what is generated that will give me an index of what is the speed at which the shaft is rotating
and this has all this circuitry built inside it, you do not need any kind of external calibration
so between the terminals, what will be the resistance
so these are examples of nets where the number of terminal points can run into thousands or even more
opposite star element is 20
so the air gap will not affect the armature current or armature power factor, right
so, whenever whenever this, go for two wattmeter methods
now in standard progressive matrices you are of course, looking at the simplest one right now, but if you look at the full test you would realize that the difficulty level keeps on increasing
general equation means, suppose this is for branch one, jj is equal to one
so, m cannot be element number, m will be something else such that i get enough equations in enough variables that is my objective only then i can solve it right
we need to go through all the numbers one at a time to check if they are primes, and we need a list of all the primes we have seen so far
so this one is my favourite, one of my favourites of the principle principle number 13, the other way round and here we do the opposite to solve a problem
we are in module number 7, learning about how to construct surface models and further we are learning little bit about overview on computer graphics
in early design model, seven associated multipliers are used
this way this way although you need not plot the graph every time, so what you have to do is that you have to just you have to see that when you write the code actually you have to see this loss is decreasing, right
so, you can make it i 1 cos phi 1 is equal to i 2 dash cos 31
but due to the action of lateral forces and the rotation of the unit, half the brick joint, half the brick join sees an increase in the compression and that's minus sigma a and the other half sees a reduction which is going to be a level lesser than sigma y
now, earlier people use to use the eeg data
in both the cases, we will be doing some limiting processes
now next is that in the similar way when we do current transformation we have to always be sure that the current source have at least one resistance in parallel, if you are not sure how it will be looking like you can modify the circuit slightly like here, you see 1 ampere current source is in parallel with 3 ohm so you can rewrite redraw the circuit in this fashion so, that you can easily see that there is 1 ampere current source in parallel with 3 ohm resistance so, when you are sure, then you can apply the source transformation and get the value
first of all, how do you define depreciation
so what i am trying to do is, i am sorry, i should have shown this like this
let us look at top view is this object
it is conservative considering the fact that the grout and the unit are required to have at least the same strength
so so with respect to the imaginary one, the edge weight can be zero
so, you can easily find out the ice crystal or snow, your bold one, rain is the bold one then snow also it is there and your ice crystal also showing by your double arrow right the here it is
so, what we understood is, that, once we know the formula which is so super easy formula 1 upon 2 pi rc, right
so, if we have list1 is the value 1, 3, 5, 7 list2 is the value 4, 5, 6, 8
but, as i said, in a real clock distribution scenario the clock distribution points may not be so uniformly located
so that justifies that this is the signature that i need to ensure if i am implementing this operator as a global function
these two are the here the reference are b refers to the b object; r d refers to the d object
so, line current is i c , yeah and your voltage it looks at the a b c , it looks at voltage c b right although b to c, v b c, v a b, v b c b c is given, but it will be v c b because this is the phase c and this is connected to b
so, total change in flux density will be doubled
we could advice that pml is for the normal incidence
now that we have seen the importance of r1, r2 dash reduction and x1, x2 dash reduction, let’s try to see how to estimate the parameters or equivalent circuit parameters of the transformer
once the dial gauge is fixed you need to measure the gauge length, that is the distance between the two knife edges of the dial gauge, then you need to measure the gap length that is the distance between the upper and lower grip to get the total deformation or total elongation of the strand at the end of the testing
it now suppose the aggressor changes the voltage by an amount delta v aggressor
that has to be shifted in serially in shift register mode
so this is for the capacitance and let us save this and let us close and redo the simulation
am i going to be using a linear static analysis
so, whatever will come here with the 13 it will be in series whatever will come here it will be in series is 30 and whatever will come here it will be in series in 40 that is whatever you have got 4 point 4 four 8
now, you guys you have to understand, once you read what are the types of noises right, understand where exactly this noises are generated, and how can you solve, how can you solve or how can you find if there is a noise in an electronic circuit ok
so, one of the first things to do, sometimes this is very convenient is to neglect this one when compared to this
naturally, you see, if i go to a different point, which is say, here, you're going to see that s unit vector has changed direction
now, h is known so, this h is known we know the height of the building, this can this time required for the person to come down can be measured and k should also be known
for example, we have a corner for example, you have a floor, room floor where edges are slightly corner, that corner can be this
and that means, from this equation we have to try to solve this circuit
this part of the thing and one can make symmetric arguments by measuring whatever this distance, for example, the easiest way to extend this line is, we have to construct many horizontal lines 1
so, if this is a semicircle of radius epsilon coming from case 1 over here, what should what will you say this answer is
so, if i have 2 default values, and if i want to only specify the second of them, it is not possible; i will have to redefine the function to reorder it
so, a vertical positioning he is moving the vertical position
so, that is cos omega t
so when i look at lap winding and wave winding like this let me draw one winding structure for a 4 pole dc machine lap wound and let us say i am going to have 12 slots you understand what is a slot
like sales budget, when we are planning that whatever we are going to sell in the market, everything is not going to be on cash sales or on the all sales are not going to be based on the cash
now, this delta t should what should be greater than or less than this
it is a common controller for pattern designs and trademarks, filed by submitting to the office
most of the modern microcontrollers are based on the harvard architecture, where you will be having a separate program memory and a separate data memory
so, in a way that interest rates are locked for the borrower also and for the bank also, so this can be done or can be possible with the help of the forward rate agreements and these forward rate agreement protect the interest of each other
not only that, you see, we are typically using some cad tools from some of the vendors right now
it is called as a dispersion curve because of this curve was a straight line like this, there would have been no dispersion
whatever not visible by dashed lines
if one would like to draw an inclined line with mini drafter, one will one will keep the set square there and draw a line in that direction
while making the z with your eyes, it is also important to look closely at certain sections of the audience once and twice varying the gaze depending on the suitability of the content
so, that this is just a constant, so 4 phi m over h square
so, they are already sinusoidals the antenna distorts is a little bit, but the deviation may not be much
you say here is the current source this much value so many amps is there at this place in time and space
discrete means those variables for which the individual value falls on the scale only with certain gap and the gap is very distinct
so, what is the sort of geometry of this physical problem
now for this and for many more reasons we do not consider a search to be a perfect reflection of patentability of our invention
so, if we say fh dot read 10, it will read the next pan number and keep going and this will save you some space in the long run
we do not want this photoresist right
i write the field u of x in terms of these basis functions right
we have now the sr steel, lloyd steel, jindal steel, tata is already there in the market
so, so beautiful firsthence, first capacitor charges andthen is discharges, then inductor charges andthat discharge, followed by the capacitor charginge and capacitor discharginge again inductor charges this goes on this goes on continuously right and cycle continues
so, the way i demonstrate here is, here i only show i have shown on the left side, i have only shown the inaccessible members that is if i have a class f in i am sorry a function f in class b, then x is in accessible to this function
now there is another simple, small example
the questions clear
so, 2 i hope it is understandable to you because when you are understanding this t 0 to t
so, put the rate inside the bracket and multiply it by the time
this is another very important aspect of the amplifier design how linear it is that is how close the input output relationship of the amplifier are towards are to a linear relationship that is output should be proportional to the input
so here we classified the different zones here and then you can go back to the original image and you can see okay, what is the fly ash with the composition in this zone three we can see it is all these particles here and what is in zone four is all these particles here and then we can actually look at the individual chemical compositions of all these fly ashes
so, here, date wise information is not known but during a particular month they know the goods purchased, transport cost and storage cost
so, going back to frequency meter this is what we are studying now
i want the field everywhere
so, look at these videos
i will be the inform density sigma
so, let us learn how to calculate the standard rate
it is also very time consuming, sometime very expensive, and once again the bias of the observer might influence findings of case studies
so, hence phi 1 is equal to phi 1 1 plus phi 1 2 right the total flux
different frequencies
so you are trying to design a game for little kids using a design thinking philosophy, that is good bala, the first thing you should do is empathize with the potential users of your game and is really nice that you are sitting here and playing this game and seeing what it would be like, but that’s just the first stage of the empathising phase
so, wherever it is intersecting, let us stop it; let us call that point p 1
therefore, when i take minus of divergence of m, it is as if on this disk for calculation of h there is a positive magnetic charge here, negative magnetic charge here and kind of field is give rise to, would be like the electric field
suppose we find that it is significantly larger
so static timing analysis will give you a quick way of telling which of the paths are critical and which are not right
the reluctance is changing, the inductance is changing
disaster
do you refer any kind of notes prepared that you have prepared or your friend has passed
driven from a source impedance of one mega ohm, if i b is 10 nanoampere, it will introduce an additional 10 millivolts of error
and this way come to the end of this lecture
so, if i take this example if i take this schematic, which is right in front of you guys and i want to find this vgd then i had to use a kirchhoffs voltage law
but we do not live in a very very ideal environment, no kid is born and brought up in a ideal environment
right now, we can see on the screen there is a sine wave
so, when i simplify this equation over here del cross e there is a only one term that survives which is a z hat d u by d x
we can understand the regional associations and social backgrounds of the person, we can understand the economic affairs of that individual
so, this is a network and it has multiple inputs say, call it input 1, another is input 2 this is the reference terminal or ground terminal of this network
if we know that the signal frequency is some omega not or the smallest signal frequency is omega not and if the capacitors happen to have a very small reactance, then you can treat them as short circuits
similarly now we use in the context of magnetic field this equation that the divergence of magnetic field is always zero
so, let us 1st, start with 1 port devices
while reading this module probably you have taken already 2 or 3 breaks
later on, however, it was found that it is not necessary that everybody has the similar type of wrinkles
so, this was a very basic of introduction for this assembly and motion study
so, and if you apply your and this is a series field resistance r s right and if you apply here also your what you call that kvl
and it also performs radio resource management, time and frequency synchronization signals to bts
and, even if the initialization list is provided, is it necessary to initialize
so it is not really effective in stopping the hydration
we have input voltage we have output voltage, we have gain; that means, we have given already this input signal, we have given this input signal, if you see in the table, right to the inverting terminal right
you would find that it is interesting to note that even the routine activities which are conducted with the help of our mouth, for example, is speaking to others the very fact of a speech, at other same time talking even eating communicate a lot about the personality, the background, etcetera and our like clues to understanding the personality of other people
there is no j let us make it 1 d
ok, so this is the basic idea and you can see that may
it may be possible that input cost has gone down and it may remain stable
now, a validity report or what we call a patentability study would be used in at least 3 different situations
carriage inward if it is given then certainly it is a part of your prime cost because carriage inward is given on the material which is coming into the factory
disgust is important, and it shows up in places that you would least expect it
it is constructed with the hollow concrete masonry units of thickness 200 millimetres
but if there is any difference then we will have to look for and we will have to calculate the variances, the labor mixed variances or the gang composition variances
for example, tape recorder if i want that to run at a particular speed only obviously
so, again this slides are with you you try to do at wherever place you have the access to work on this, right
answer is yes because depreciation may be higher, some expenses may be higher in taxation and certain incomes may be exempt for tax purposes
so, this is the here what you call the plot of your i t when t is equal to 0 when t is equal to 0, so i t is equal to this initial value that is i 0 and it is decay it is decaying right and your it is written is equal to i 0 is equal to t minus tau and tau is equal to l by r right, that is your time constant of the circuit right
it is always 50 hertz at least in our country
these programs are very small, but we will go quite in depth to actually analyse these programs, so you could actually downloads these programs from this bit bucket repository, which contains not just a programs, but also gives you a lot of instructions about how to run these particular programs and also this repository would contains slides and other assignments that you could try out
can already see that one colomb is a lot, lot of charge
it comprises of ye'elimite, also called c4a3s, calcium sulfoaluminate, belite as you know also present in portland cement
we need to know where is this field coming from, how old is it, how new is it and some of the places where this field will be applied to
i would like to join that, then escape, press enter
the second step that, she did was to get her kids ready for school as well
so, i am going to call the set of basis vectors for the domain i am going to give the symbol b ok
so, i have to try to draw something in 3d
so, ceo is given substantially high salary, a very high salary and also a lot of perks
so i am writing e i dt as the electrical energy input
r equals minus six volts
so, your i2 by i1 will become n1 by n2
so minus sigma a is where the joint is getting compressed over one half of the brick unit
for balance sheet, we take the total of balance sheet and common size statements become very much useful not only for comparison of items within the same company that is just the last year of the same company but it is also useful across the industry so for example suppose there is a small cement company and there is a large cement company their absolute figures will be different so you cannot compare them in absolute figures but you convert them as a percentage of sales if we are comparing p&l and then it will be compared across different companies we are going to see a few cases like that so so, this is called as a vertical analysis
one interesting story i will discuss with you with regard to the pricing and the cost of the product
if we can do that, that is what we call normal
that is the fundamental difference
so, i am only taking the 3rd component right
so when we are going to design we know with confidence where these are the property we have going to get, unlike in case of concrete, we are not very sure what properties we are going to achieve
but, as opposed to on boarding they are blank, they do not know anything about your company; you have to give them very detailed examples so, that they understand what is expected of them
so you develop code on one version, it don't work on another version
now as we know ptmalloc2 is present in the gilibc library which is linked with all standard c or c++ programs that you write on a typical linux system
we have not picked up from anywhere else
what we learnt in last lecture is interior charge distribution is given, let us say this is rho r prime and i am calculating force on a charge q at a distance
shakespeare has particularly alluded to the expression of eyes and he has often looked at eyes as an expression of human character
so, let us see on the screen, how it how you can design this
so, dependent sources also will be covered so, those are the things and we will start from the basic concepts right basic concepts and from there will your what you call slowly and slowly will move into you know much deeper understanding
if slip is negative that means omega r is greater than omega s, very clearly right because omega s minus omega r that is what we said as the slip, slip speed that divided by omega s gives me the overall slip that is what we said
so, that is safe, the safe part of it
so in other words it is the maximum size that needs to be overcome for the mercury to actually completely flood the porous system in the concrete, okay so the threshold pore size is of great importance because that often defines what is the available size which the incoming fluid has to overcome in order to penetrate the material, okay so this threshold pore size as you can readily imagine reduces when you reduce the water to cement ratio of the system
so as it completes, then the background tasks start running
so, these two boundaries are not important
and then you will again check whether all your bars are in tension or there are some bars in compression with the same set of expressions that we saw earlier
the carbon dioxide equivalent is a way of lumping together all such gasses in terms of a equivalent of carbon dioxide
ok, but in a clock, typically we implement a clock triggered flip flop, a flip flop triggered by a clock with respect to some of the edges
z direction bunch of scalars multiplying a vector in the z direction, so z
so, that is in that is the reason why you use this centered two point difference because if i just look at the first equation over here
do they need to be, or are they really competitors or they are actually helping each other
as soon as we turned the current on, there was a magnetic field which was produced, which was time dependent, which is proportional to the current, which is also time dependent, and therefore d b d t is not equal to zero
so, if it is 0, it is t by 4 then t by 2 and so on right
in your case, if you have not at installed geda, you will see that it will give a list of packages and ask you whether to install or not you say yes and it will get installed
this is a comparative balance sheet
one thing has to follow the other and a should always precede b and a should end before the task b begins
and theta one theta 2 are the angles of v 1 and v 2 respectively, right
so, when we are looking in that direction horizontal plane rotate it we will see it like it rectangle and this one maps to a circle in that way
we have calculated from this information
so the wavefronts are slowly expanding in their sizes and they are coming closer and closer together
do you see any moment in the number of shares
so even if they are of kind of opposite polarity it should not matter so much because they are anyway on the verge of changing this process of changing the current from positive to negative, or negative to positive we call that as commutation which we will discuss in detail at the later class not today
that is why, i also tell you the examples
so, these are non computational because it does these do not actually modify the data but rather they just either store the data or just route the data to specific locations or just provide a look up so on
so it makes sense to define a magnetic dipole, alright, and i can say that magnetic field, which i am going to denote by b, b, r, is going to be some constant which will depend on the units, the net magnetic dipole moment dotted with r, r three minus m, divided by r cubed
similarly the red line is connected to 1 in this case and 0 in this particular multiplexer and therefore when the select line is 0, it is a red line that can switch
that's why it is marked as both i and o
so from here, i should be able to write this as henry per meter
yes, it is also integrated circuit
so this thermister is called by various names in the market
so, te4 is also present but we will not be using this and the other tables i use for decryption which is not going to be important for us
the first ic on the left corner
if i have 10 turns, definitely i am going to have a higher amount of mmf
we want the output to rectifier
the these two conditions so, this two values of r x will be very close to each other on this scale will be very close to each other on the scale ok
this actually seems to be worst then our earlier algorithm in certain cases
so, again he is connecting this multimeter, right
so, it is also small it is almost 0 will neglect it, right
the first expression is useful when vgs is constant
5 this is the mid length, that is mean height right, 8
this is june, this is july and this is august
do not use it rather use this circuit where you can connect a voltmeter directly across this resistance r x
so, that is what is written in right
now we will do one more problem, right
so this is placement
but this can be brought into a teaching and learning context, and several e learning platforms right from open source, lms is like moodle have wikis as a built into tool
so when i am actually looking at a rectifier output i may have a phase, b phase and c phase rectified completely right
so problem that you just saw the solution of, in which we had a point dipole in an infinite medium and what was exploited was that m induced due to the magnetic field that was produced by the, this dipole is going to be proportional to b itself and therefore their functional dependence on r or space variables was the same
so, we calculate pat plus those number of shares
so, to fix this we will select the two edges of crankshaft, and this crank casing and we will to make it coincide and we will select ok in this mini toolbar
so, this is the delete call
so, under short circuit test, whatever is the voltage i apply, indirectly it gives me an indication of what are the internal impedances of the winding of the transformer, it gives me a feel for what is r1 plus r2 dash, what is x1 plus x2 dash
to understand what is priority inversion, let's assume that a task instance that is a job is executing its critical section
when it is non static, i do not care about this, because if it is non static i know at some point some object will get instantiated like obj 1; and wherever obj 1 gets instantiated, x will be a part of it
so same thing will happen here also
so, if you see the particular forward path all three loops which you can see in the signal flow graph are touching the forward path
you put all these values, that means; magnitude of v 4 that expression of v j your what you call v m 2 is equal to d j j minus a j j to the power half
if they are at opposite signs, then force is going to be attractive
the output is floating and the voltage will depend on the charge stored in the load capacitor
so usually the quality of the partitions that are generated in this process is not so good
they may invite an expert speaker, they may conduct workshops; they may have some kind of an awareness measure done in the university and all these things are right now being done in universities whether they have an ip centre or not
so, this is just a matter of convention that exists in c++ sort
on the other hand, if i try to draw similar thing for the motor right i am going to have basically, again let me draw may be this is what is my v angle 0 i am starting with v angle 0 okay
zone 2 was corroding more
let us now see, explore this equations a better in this lecture and see what they predict
in this a module we have actually continued from our previous module, the module 18 and we have discussed about several issues of operator overloading a specifically the issue of doing operator overloading when your parameter types could be varied and when particularly in terms of io when your two parameters are of two different class types and so on
all 3 transformers have a thermal capability of 120 percent of the nameplate rating capacitor, that is that whenever the gain this kind of thing that 120 percent of the thermal rating thermal capability; that means, you will concentrate this way that i i am sure that you have studied in machine design also for transformer design the meaning is you take it other way this transformer can take overload of 20 percent more than that right
firstly, we should never do it because then, i mean if we are inserting a high impedance in series, the transmission line is disturbed it is current i mean even i mean because we know ammeter should not have large impedance; why
the average gross profit on the sales is 40 percent is another important condition for calculating the cost, especially the cost of material
welcome to this module and in this module, we will understand what exactly photoresist is
yeah, you want to know now what is electric field let us at the location exactly you want to
so, if ever i just give some symbols, if v i is increased then of course, v n will also increase because v n is some sort of average of this v i and v o
but when i am talking about nonideality in any machine i am definitely going to have some inherent resistance for the armature
so, it means if you calculate this amount, total interest you have to calculate here is for 318,000 for a period of 2 months at the rate of 10% and on the balance of 10,000 for a period of how many months for one month only and the rate of 10%
sorry this is not volt this is the ohm then you can
right; so these guys, these guys and these guys this is where the medium properties come into place ok
so, what is happening here is that, square is being assigned to f, 5 is being assigned to x, and 2 is being assigned to n
so, this is the last module for this particular lecture, we were looking at the opamp and using the opamp as several circuits
so, p point to k and k to q; they are equal
so now people talk about creating something called ah technology library where some of the small standard designs i have already created in a very efficient way
and this was not just in 2000, this was happening in last four years from 96 to 2000, continuous accounting manipulations were done and thus profits were overstated
on the other hand, if i is not a common factor we need to proceed by checking the next one which is to go backwards and this is the achieved by this update
so, we are putting it as a separate figure and then the next cost is the so first we have taken the variable cost then we have taken the fixed cost and this is normal cost sheet and here we have calculated the total cost of production is how much that is 21 lac 55,000
on notebooks
so you get the value of v3 as 2
so, let me let me make some space by erasing one step and ok
upwards means that we have to connect an inductor in shunt and that is what we have done
so in red we are marking r a t, required arrival time
so, i just have followed the direction where in which direction i want the current to flow and i have put these diodes accordingly
so, so v ab v ab will be cancelled therefore, i ca will be equal to i ab angle minus 24 240 degree; that means, also ibc similarly you will get i ab angle minus 120 degree
so let me try to draw this particular winding lap winding for dc machine
the voltage across terminals a b divided by the current supplied by current source
plus the schema no how the representation of the world that you have made in your mind, the mental representation, that might be important in terms of better recollection, accurate recollection or distortion and how motivated you are to recollect the information that would also play an important role
global edge number 1, what all variables would have come
once that is done divide cf into 5 equal parts
for example, the way we arrange curtains, screens, the partitions which we create with the help of furniture etcetera and at the same time the way we use colors
no wonder we have become a very important commodity, power electronic engineer, who make inverters, who basically generate variable frequency
so, we are almost there; so, let me put a few subscripts here this k over here, this is a on a right; that means, the source and the testing point were a and a
or so i think we can put that as the two alternate activities
so, r a ammeter resistance should be very low compared to r x and then this method is not perfect though, but it is this method is acceptable because then the voltage drop across the this ammeter will be much lower compared to the voltage drop across r x
and z total number of armature conductors right
because you know this one if you go to equation 31, you go to equation 31, that is your this equation, right
1 v
now, from center o to p join a line and draw a perpendicular line to op in such a way that we are going to measure this distance 19 mm
so, finally, after having done all of this theory the payoff is how do i actually implemented in my method
those neurotransmitter secretion will lead to muscle contraction, further lead to muscle force generation
also find the circuit current, the voltage across the capacitor and the bandwidth of the circuit right
it will not be counted into the power loss; we are talking mainly about the real power losses
i urge you to go through it once
so, if i tried to plot magnetization characteristics, i am trying to say that they are mainly operating in the linear region of operation
and this slide here just summarizes the most popular preparation techniques of fresh slice, sorry fresh mix where you can look at the hydration in situ of a slice or a powder
if you say you are useless, girl maybe or you are ugly looking or you are fat or you are this and that we use such words at home our home, home situation is pretty bad
so, clearly this cost will vary for different case, and there are many number of cases
so, then we have to make the payments
they mostly type in the laptops and things are good for them
so, we go in and out of evaluate phase after each of the previous phases
i cancel this
so, when a wwhatever he is trying to implement, look carefully right look carefully and try to do it at home
so here suppose you assume your resonator, this resonator to be a simple series r l c network
so, we ensure that by creating a type or aliasing a type drawfunc here by type def; which says that it takes a structure geoobject and returns a void
and that is how you can calculate the output voltage, how it will change with respect to input below the cut off frequency
so there are some simple, set theoretic rules i will be illustrating, using which you can compute the fault lists
this is one more example, before which we will go to the actual experiment, is band pass filter if calculate higher and lower cut off frequencies of active band pass filter, right
so, v 0 is equal to your ah 2 into 20 40 volt, now v 1 is equal to 2
but if the budgeted performance was more than the actual performance is a negative variance and in terms of the cost it is reversed so budgeted cost was less and the actual cost is more in that case there is a negative variance we will have to find out the reasons for that and in case of the cost itself if the actual cost is or the budgeted cost was more and the actual cost is less it is a it negative, it's a positive variance
so, let me start by saying that here this line over here we when we say that say that e is evaluated at integer time girds is a choice, i could have said e is evaluated at half integer time instance ok
so, this is interesting just go go let us go back to the circuit, right
so, here if you want to use this multimeter, like i have shown you in the last module, we can we can keep it in the resistance mode
here we need to find i0 minus id
yeah electric field derivative at n minus half captures everything right
similarly, whatever these horizontal distance on this point, for example, let us pick this one, the same point we will be having on this side
now the simplest example is if i take a magnet and bring a pin close to it, it gets attracted
so if i apply dell dot j is equal to minus d row d t
now we will get into why we are using two of them it is a very beautiful geometric property only
so, on e7, the control will go to the destructor
at the end of the month of the month in question, money is never borrowed at the beginning and repaid at the end of the same month
i think the major points again is i will reiterate is the first part which is the demography of the customer, the age, the geography and for fun you can even give a the person a name and that sort of rounds up the personality
now, sometimes you want to be a little bit more precise, so for this we can use the format method which is actually part of the string library
similarly, we find that there are some other interesting positions which our mouth is capable of taking
so, this is to be read; rose is a flower that is the direction of the arrow, red rose is a rose and so on
so in this case i have showed two possible matchings
so if i were, if i know the geometry and the material strengths, can i for the geometry estimate what the strength in compression of the masonry wall is
so, these two lines are straight lines that go from the origin and define into which region you would fall
so, comfort means that for example if the income level of the people goes up, then it can be expected that more ctvs may be demanded by the people or maybe there are the different variants of the ctvs
which is opr
so, that means if x 1 is negative the lowest point o of the imaginary curve dashed line outside the actual span as shown in figure c
and a fundamental assumption here which can become a point that you take forward and improve with a nonlinear stress strain relationship in compression
so what i mean to say is that the design, at this same level of abstraction, can be viewed from three different angles: one as the behavior, other as a net list and the other as some components which are actually manufactured and the system is, ah miss, implemented by inter connecting them like chips, in this case
in this case the rotor now carries three phase currents creating the mmf f2 rotating in the same direction and with the same speed as the stator field
furthermore, most of the functions in the library are unused
so as this is getting charged up this is trying to turn this on this goes through the linear region tries to limit the current through this and then after after it reaches stable state this would be at 15 volts and this would be fully on
summation over each time instant right; so, i have this is my time instant say this is my time 0 to t i am going to chop it up into intervals of delta t and then do a summation that is what will happen ok
thirdly, there could be some key references that are missed out in certain databases or which do not throw up in certain databases, and and it could be a reason for missing out something which was already there
now, with one port elements, we have seen that we could write the equations, then expand the non linearities in a taylor series around the operating point, neglect higher order terms and so on
these are the 2 sub problems for paths(5, 10), namely (4, 10) and (5, 9) but, in turn in order to compute (4, 10) i will have to compute whatever is to its left and below it and in order to compute (5, 9) i will also have to compute what is to its left and below it and now what we find is that this quantity namely (4, 9) is computed twice, once because of the left neighbor of (5, 10) and once because of the neighbor below (5, 10)
so, e minus e i that i can think of as phi right, but what about the second term the term that companies k naught squared is it in that form yet its not right
so, i is flowing through this is i so, 10 into i right plus we are move we are moving like this; we are moving like this we are moving like this plus your this i 2 current is flowing through 60 and 30; so, 90 i2 90 i2 right, then minus 4 is equal to 0 because this 5 volt so, right but i were, but question is that 10 i is equal to i 1 plus i 2 plus 90 i 2 is equal to 5 right, but i 2 is equal to i 1
0 is already, there is no need to change it, no worries,
so e inside would be zero and e at the surface would always be perpendicular and far away
in terms of x and u, i can write this as and x like this x 1, x n multiplied by u 1, u n right
so, it is i0 sin ∅ and this i c will be i0 cos ∅0 right
what are the reasons and who is going to look at this numbers
company pays cash, so bank balance come on jay
now why do we need to stop hydration
in general range i, j, like a slice i to j, starts at i and goes up to j minus 1
a final use of heap is to actually sort, we are taking out one element at a time starting with maximum one
this is what you would have seen many times in railway compartment and all
we are not trying to stop corrosion
